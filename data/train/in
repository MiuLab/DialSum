water-proof as well . <EOS> maybe it is original because you can uh use it in your uh in your bath whereas the others can't . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> waterproof . <EOS> and i think we should have a device <EOS> maybe water-proof would be very original . <EOS> sorry . <EOS>
see <EOS> that's the problem , <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i mean , i i know it's more interesting to develop a remote controller with speech and gesture and whatever . <EOS> but you have to think , the user is the one who gonna buy the product <EOS> and so . <EOS>
tim , can you start ? <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah ? <EOS> 'kay , <EOS> welcome . <EOS> i have some uh new findings on uh marketing expert level , <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> which i will show you . <EOS> the method i used was um giving orders to our usability lab uh to do a questionnaire . <EOS> um one hundred respondents were involved <EOS> and my marketing uh department generated a report with a lot of results . <EOS> um , these were a couple of findings , first page of three . <EOS> um , we have three audiences of <EOS> two audiences , <EOS> i'm sorry . <EOS> uh the first one , this scale , from sixteen to forty five age . <EOS> uh the second one is from sixty four uh forty six to sixty five . <EOS> um , as you can see here , the market share for the first audience is about sixty percent um sixty five . <EOS> uh second audience audience is uh thirty five percent . <EOS> mm and some interests from the from the age groups , <EOS> uh it seems like the young users of remote controls really like the fancy uh new technology stuff , like uh an l_c_d_ screen on the remote control , um speech recognition . <EOS> i don't think that's uh really appropriate . <EOS> um , and when you see uh the audience , the age is going up uh yeah , they don't really want it anymore , at least the new technologies . <EOS> second findings out of the questionnaire um are the opinion the opinions uh of the audience about current remote controls . <EOS> first point is , seventy five percent of the users find the most repo remote controls very ugly , <EOS> uh and eighty percent of the users would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy . <EOS> so that's maybe something for the user interface uh designer . <EOS> okay , <EOS> third findings . <EOS> according to the frequency of use versus importance investigation , um following buttons are most important . <EOS> um , i will tell something about the way this uh this test was , yeah , done . <EOS> um , persons were asked uh what the buttons were uh they use most , how much an hour , <EOS> and uh in the second table the importance of those buttons . <EOS> um , when you multiply them , you get the these three points . <EOS> switching channels , um yeah , <EOS>
i know you've got the pen , <EOS> you might attack me with it . <EOS> better than that than the banana . <EOS> and then the teamwork i think i think it worked quite quite nicely , yeah . <EOS> i think it worked quite well . <EOS> did anyone feel that they were getting sort of covered up and not being able to say their bit ? <EOS>
exactly . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> i mean a nice although we do um wh uh is <EOS> i'm recalling that she mentioned that we n need to get away from the surgical white kind of brushed aluminium thing <EOS> and get back to it <EOS> but you could have a very tasteful um wood coloured or earth tone kind of um <EOS>
the marketing comes out . <EOS> yes . <EOS> yeah so <EOS> it'd be hard to inflate something ou made out of titanium though . <EOS> yeah <EOS> the the <EOS> i'm sorry <EOS> because uh the last meeting we supposed to discuss about the financial thing . <EOS> uh let me go quickly , maybe if i can go back . <EOS> i know the project plan and the budget . <EOS> so i can close this , not sure . <EOS> was in uh s this . <EOS> so let me see where is this file . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> i'd say number one . <EOS> number one ? <EOS> okay . <EOS> number number one for the first criteria . <EOS> one . yeah . <EOS> i think w if it was just the sounder then th i mean something i've found with uh w w <EOS> with say tr trying to find uh a cordless phone or a m mobile , you can hear it , <EOS> but you can't quite pin it dow pin down where it is . <EOS>
okay , i hope <EOS> wait . <EOS> should it just <EOS> i it'll take some time . <EOS> it ta takes a little <EOS> there's just nothing . <EOS> oh , and have you <EOS> you need to then also press on yours , function f_ eight , <EOS> so the blue function key at the bottom and f_ eight . <EOS>
well i suppose that's our that's that's our design that we've got . so <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah yeah . <EOS> well that's that's uh <EOS> okay , so project evaluation . <EOS> we have under twelve euros fifty . <EOS> project process , how do we think that went ? <EOS> are we happy ? <EOS>
uh-huh . <EOS> okay . <EOS> right . <EOS> so , chip on print is just means like that they're mass-produced . <EOS> okay . <EOS> and case ? <EOS> uh i guess that's what we've been talking about , <EOS> yeah . casing . yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> case is what we were discussing yeah . <EOS>
okay , <EOS> welcome to the second meeting of this uh design group . <EOS> um i'll briefly go through the uh notes of the of the last meeting <EOS> uh just done in in note form <EOS> and i haven't attributed anything to individuals , <EOS> because we're working strictly as a team here <EOS> and uh n nobody's working equally , <EOS> so uh . um <EOS> we we s we saw that the the problems with existing remote controls were the uh b a boring shape and boring colour . <EOS>
well i dunno . <EOS> um i'm sure the little uh the little thing'll pop up any minute now . <EOS> can we turn off the microphones ? <EOS> yeah , yeah if the meeting's over then yeah i guess so . <EOS>
yes . <EOS> yes . <EOS> yeah , that's a good idea . <EOS> or any major sports . <EOS> or another m major sports event . <EOS> probably not the um the football games coming up the end of january . <EOS> i think that might be a little too aggressive um , <EOS> but , so , i'm just ig uh pointing out a uh a strategy to uh do some additional user testing <EOS> pri and then to launch um at a a major sports event <EOS> or uh perhaps to uh also <EOS>
right . <EOS> yes . okay . <EOS> thin i think we should work . <EOS> yeah <EOS> i think . <EOS> final thoughts from anyone , <EOS> or ? <EOS> we're finished . <EOS> okay , well <EOS> thank you very much . <EOS> no . <EOS> no . <EOS>
right , <EOS> and we got say over what how technologically advanced it should be <EOS> and also how fashionable , which i kind of like <EOS> we <EOS> yep . <EOS> and we're a fashion forward technology company . <EOS> right . <EOS> you know it . <EOS> um what about um the teamwork aspect ? <EOS> how did you guys enjoy making the model , the prototype ? <EOS>
mm . <EOS> but we're not looking at whether they're early adopters on that screen , <EOS> that's looking at age groups . <EOS> uh , mm . <EOS> exactly . i yes , <EOS> and i'm making and i'm making the the uh uh leap that people who are familiar younger people are l are more familiar with technology than than older people . or comfortable , <EOS> you know , um so <EOS>
they're not going to be as <EOS> ugly . <EOS> worse than a banana . <EOS> and they they might not be a as easy as this <EOS> yeah . <EOS> and it <EOS> yeah this is gonna f you know handy to use . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so ? what now ? what range ? <EOS>
um do you have any ideas how to possibly use these ? um how to how to use a fruit or vegetable or um or the spongy material at all ? <EOS> like <EOS> could we make a s like could we make a spongy remote ? <EOS> it would be easier on the hands . <EOS>
no . <EOS> no , no whiteboard . <EOS> and <EOS> um , also had i not been intrigued about the pen , i don't think i woulda used it at all , <EOS> i didn't write barely anything . <EOS> yeah <EOS> i think i was taking notes more often than usual <EOS> just 'cause i liked the pen , yeah . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> and then after that we can make the user uh inter interface . <EOS> then look . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah 'cause i have to uh focus on the on the basic look-and-feel design . <EOS> so how it's gonna look . <EOS> and you have to think uh how we're gonna put the screen in it and those kind of things . <EOS> so if i'm drawing and you think okay i'm not gonna be able to put a screen in there , you have to correct . <EOS> uh do you mind if i draw in black then ? for normal sketches . <EOS>
i'd say let's start with the first presentation . <EOS> um in the same order as last time ? <EOS> okay . <EOS> 'kay . <EOS> w <EOS> sure . <EOS> mm . alright . <EOS> well , <EOS> take it away . <EOS> okay <EOS> uh welcome you all . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> um you will be working on on technical function design , so <EOS> yeah , sure . <EOS> and uh you and you and uh uh uh well , think about requirements , <EOS> eh ? <EOS> does it need internet , <EOS> or or do do we stay at <EOS>
i think <EOS> yeah , okay . <EOS> digital pen . <EOS> so we made it in time . <EOS> and we made a remote control . <EOS> we did it . <EOS> in the budget , yeah . <EOS> new ideas found . <EOS> new ideas . <EOS> what's that ? <EOS>
aye , i see what you mean , yeah . <EOS> marketing . <EOS> good marketing thoughts . <EOS> oh gosh , <EOS> i should be writing all this down . um . <EOS> yep . <EOS> right away i'm making some kind of assumptions about what what information we're given here , <EOS> thinking , 'kay trendy probably means something other than just basic , <EOS> something other than just standard . um <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> but uh but the but then o uh obviously if <EOS> uh you know <EOS> if you i if you wanted to access further functions i you you then get to sort of menu navigation . <EOS> i mean with things like ch with things like tuning and channels um you know adjusting brightn uh brightness and fiddly things that no one really bothers with , most t_v_s these days actually have menus anyway <EOS> so this would be a fairly rational way of integra <EOS>
and you could page the remote if you lose it . <EOS> maybe there's a button on the cradle . <EOS> yep , that's right . <EOS> i really see <EOS> but the cost i <EOS> now the the question is can we make this for less than twelve-fifty per ? <EOS>
and and th to get to back to another point , <EOS> sorry uh uh for cutting in but , <EOS> i th i think it's important to remember that that this remote has to work with multiple t_v_s , yeah , <EOS> 'cause it's selling on its own . <EOS> it's not going to be specifically for hitachi t_v_s or or whatever . <EOS>
but i don't think that uh we should <EOS> we should talk about uh the design of the box also which needs some money . <EOS> but <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay <EOS> also have to say <EOS> did you receive the email about the voice recognition ? <EOS> um that's all <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i haven't chec <EOS>
okay , but it has to be easy to uh to use though and to hold you know , <EOS> you don't wanna pear or a watermelon . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> don don't you think we can find uh the shape of a fruit which is handy to use ? <EOS>
y you can't you can't lose it if you're sixty years old . <EOS> if first time see the thing you didn didn't adjust uh set the microphone , and then you lose it , then you have lost it . <EOS> yeah , y you can lose it , <EOS> but it isn't hard to lose . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> and uh the l_c_d_ . <EOS> so <EOS> we need uh the expensive , most expensive chip , if we use an l_c_d_ . <EOS> mm <EOS> i don't think that's an opportunity . <EOS> just skip it . <EOS> because we don't have time for that to to put it in . <EOS>
so i think we have finished the designing and the evaluation of our remote control <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> and we have a nearly final product . <EOS> our final prototype which yeah . <EOS> final prototype , yeah , ye yeah . <EOS> final prototype , right . <EOS> so , <EOS> thank you very much . <EOS> very productive . <EOS>
why ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> why ? <EOS> then looking at individual components , <EOS> so that's actually a f step further . <EOS> uh . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> like <EOS> we all have a list of uh things that has to b that have to be in it , or how it has to be like . <EOS> and then in the next meeting we decide <EOS>
well <EOS> i i brought up some <EOS> exactly , <EOS> but i think you raised some good questions <EOS> about are there enough of these people out there , <EOS> or are they making purchasing decisions ? <EOS> you know , <EOS> these are the <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> i was wondering that , <EOS> because i ag i agree that there there're people with uh how can i put it , more money than sense <EOS> and who are liable to buy something new , <EOS> but <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> we might wanna keep it yellow . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> but if you had like a silvery kind of white or something . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> um and can we have like an r_r_ inscribed on the bottom or something ? <EOS> okay . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . uh yeah . <EOS> well <EOS> i think if we are gonna use a touchscreen uh we're gonna go way above the twelve and a half euros . <EOS> n i i don't think so . <EOS> uh you got uh quite a cheap uh touchscreen . s um it's uh not uh in colour or something . <EOS> uh it's just uh um one colo uh <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
now our our model also contains a button which is called as the menu button . <EOS> what kind of button ? <EOS> menu button . <EOS> menu ? <EOS> uh menu th menu , uh one one . <EOS> yes , menu <EOS> menu button . <EOS> at the centre <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> it is interesting but we are only concerned with the remote controller . <EOS> mm . <EOS> so you need s special t_v_ sets to do that ? <EOS> or it's it's done via this remote controller ? <EOS> it's very complex . <EOS> i mean <EOS> yeah , <EOS> i think it's a bit complex too <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> the stain . <EOS> i mean it's each person is gonna have their own personalised , individualised speech recognition remote control in wood , that's not on the market . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah , so it it's looks good the the design the functional design uh , <EOS> what about yo you ? <EOS>
for a remote . <EOS> yeah , yeah . <EOS> rubber , yeah . <EOS> and you can peel them off yeah . <EOS> so instead of the fascia that comes off being plastic , the fascia that comes off would be the rubber , <EOS> like those pens that you get with the grip , that you can you can pull that off . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm . <EOS> that's a very good idea um <EOS> and then uh maybe uh we can go a th matthew's presentation <EOS> because <EOS> yeah <EOS> s <EOS> then we could discuss later <EOS> like <EOS> we can put all ideas together . <EOS>
yeah ? <EOS> below ? <EOS> okay well <EOS> that's that's in the newsfla <EOS> okay that's a good to know . <EOS> 'kay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> it's open already so you can use to <EOS> . <EOS> mm . <EOS> find yours . <EOS> it's <EOS> f_ five . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> um the the controls themselves tend to use a very inconsistent colour scheme . <EOS> um for instance , the stand-by button isn't always red , <EOS> uh it really should be . <EOS> it's uh something the user then uh identify with . <EOS> this is a red switch off , that's how it should be . <EOS> um i'm not sure if there's any other examples of that , <EOS> but something to look out for . <EOS> um there's a problem that i've i've got couple of preferences for the the end control <EOS> um i get 'em with the the red colour button for stand-by <EOS> and s the other examples of that um <EOS>
well , that was just just our technical team added up the um production costs of the individual units . <EOS> okay <EOS> so i have bit of a spreadsheet here for this . <EOS> very co very colf colourful . <EOS> now <EOS> oh . <EOS> i've made a f few assumptions here in that i'm assuming that our power adaptor we can make for a cost of four euros , <EOS> equivalent to solar cells , <EOS> which i think is probably fair considering that we have in-house manufacturing of power adaptors already . <EOS> uh and i'm assuming that the locator beacon , <EOS> the you know the <EOS>
mm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> on the same p_c_b_ <EOS> yeah yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> well well the other aspect is that if in the when they have the ar existing product you you gonna maintain the the you're gonna keep the same customer , <EOS> because the same customer will come back to buy other add-ons . <EOS>
um . you see this okay ? <EOS> almost <EOS> no ? <EOS> it's <EOS> sorry <EOS> it's a bit . <EOS> i'll read out to you . <EOS> uh functionality , uh like people's opinions on functionality , the relevance to the remote and how often they're used . <EOS> so um <EOS> like the power . using the using the d swi the power switch to switch on t_v_ is a high relevance of nine , <EOS> but it's not frequently used . <EOS> you see what i mean ? <EOS> whereas channel selection , which is very high relevance <EOS> is used the most . <EOS> so <EOS> m we can maybe even start to cut down on or <EOS> i was possibly even thinking of a design that maybe some of the buttons are hidden from everyday use . <EOS> maybe like uh a folding ledge or something . so that we can maybe go into the channel settings and the audio settings , <EOS> which are low relevance <EOS> and rarely used . <EOS> and keep the v volume selection and channel selection very easily <EOS>
true . <EOS> uh that's all about uh the buttons . <EOS> uh the batteries , uh we also thought about that already , <EOS> uh will be chargeable with uh uh an option for a mount station <EOS> so you can uh put the uh the remote control in a mount station <EOS> so its charges itself up instead of uh plugging it in or something like that . <EOS> questions , ? <EOS>
yeah , <EOS> i was just kinda going by the web page , <EOS> 'cause they didn't give me any clear , like yellow , grey , or . <EOS> oh <EOS> i guess it is black , grey . <EOS> grey is better than black , <EOS> doesn't look so bumblebeeish . <EOS>
or not luckily . <EOS> um do you have a marketing presentation for us . <EOS> i do . okay . you guys are gonna help me do an evaluation of the criteria . <EOS> um . <EOS> okay . <EOS> so first i'll just discuss some of the criteria that i found . <EOS> just based on the past trend reports that i was looking at earlier . <EOS> and then we'll do a group evaluation of the prototype . <EOS> and then we will calculate the average score to see how we did . <EOS> um so the criteria we're gonna be looking at are the complaints um that we heard from the users who were interviewed earlier . <EOS> so <EOS> we're gonna be doing it based on a seven point scale . <EOS> and one is going to mean true , that we did actually achieve that . <EOS> with seven being false , we did not achieve that . <EOS> . <EOS> okay . <EOS>
by three euros over . <EOS> it's hard to believe . <EOS> so we'll go for the hand dynamo huh ? <EOS> so the only thing better than um a banana-shaped remote is one that you shake . <EOS> if it w <EOS> what if we completely took out the the one single button we've got on . <EOS> and just had a scroll wheel interface . <EOS> and the l_c_d_ display . <EOS> i suppose the l_c_d_ c_ display's the one that's pushing it up a bit though . <EOS>
it says it <EOS> 'kay so far i've added what i think <EOS> or what is going on ? <EOS> great . <EOS> it's blinking at me . <EOS> it's locked for editing . <EOS> read only . <EOS> i'm gonna open up a second one then 'cause it's locked for editing . <EOS> i have the original in my um my email account . <EOS>
yeah that is kind of <EOS> but yeah . <EOS> interesting . it's kind of fascinating <EOS> wasn't it ? <EOS> i mean the whole process of <EOS> wonder why <EOS> is there anything about the way that we got so much inform what was it that kept us from going to the the board ? <EOS>
uh and it d uh our provin <EOS> mm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> you think it's possible for the twelve euro fifty ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay . um so <EOS> then we we decide on on on going to this more universal kind of control . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> here there may <EOS> um , the other one is quite easy , tho though . <EOS> uh , though it has more functionality <EOS> i think it shouldn't be for the user to learn it actually . it shouldn't be diffi <EOS> okay . <EOS> hmm . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> as an optional uh feature . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> or combine uh both with a with one uh <EOS> i guess we can only choose one . <EOS> uh i think you can only fit one uh source of energy on the <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> uh . <EOS> and some sort of <EOS> it will either have a a lock button like we mentioned or or a cover or something like that . <EOS> i guess it's to the point where we need to decide about that . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay , <EOS> and we're not yeah . <EOS> are we gonna hav hav an are we d <EOS> have we decided on whether <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> i was quite worried at the end of the last meeting that we weren't getting we didn't really have enough information to make firm decisions , <EOS> but we were able to do it regardless , <EOS> so . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> i'm not usually a very decisive person , <EOS> so it helped to have people say this needs to be done in five minutes . <EOS>
no signal . <EOS> oops , <EOS> it's not plugged in , quite in well enough . <EOS> there we are . <EOS> oop , <EOS> there we go . <EOS> mm 'kay . <EOS> oh yeah . <EOS> okay , so <EOS> we're gonna look a little bit at trend watching . <EOS> basically , i was given um an executive summary <EOS> that was a market investigation on remote controls that was recently conducted , <EOS> and then also some fashion watchers in paris and milan commented on some things that are gonna be going on this year . <EOS> so <EOS> first um they had people they ranked um the important aspects of r remote controls , <EOS> and right now i d they're saying that currently there's a functional look and feel preference , <EOS> but that really , over the next year it it that's gonna be switching to fancy look and feel remotes , <EOS> so that just goes back to <EOS>
yes . <EOS> presentation . <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay . so um basically going with our trend of vegetables and we selected the colour and approximate shape of banana . <EOS> um <EOS> you think bananas are a safe thing to use ? <EOS> it's a bit um phallic . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> well the thing is , like i actually worked in a company , <EOS> and i had a role and i had to go to meetings . <EOS> and like the last thing i would have wanted would be to have to watch a video 'cause i missed a meeting . <EOS> like usually i missed meetings deliberately . <EOS> there's just <EOS> there's really not that much information that actually goes through a real meeting , like when you're actually at a real meeting in a real company . <EOS> it's mostly like rehashing old stuff . <EOS> and you're sort of going over general stuff that anybody who's sort of on task should already know . <EOS> it's like the <EOS> there's just really not a lot of information that goes through . <EOS>
it's which one would you prefer ? <EOS> i guess this . <EOS> yeah , yeah . i would say the simplest one as long as there are the uh i find the buttons that i need every time i need a button . <EOS> sure , sure . <EOS> yeah . maybe it can be yeah middle of like , between those two <EOS> li <EOS>
each of us is going . <EOS> well , <EOS> yes , <EOS> um we uh we should try to t to draw on it <EOS> and then well it should be smart some way . <EOS> i i'm not really sure how this works , but <EOS> okay , <EOS> shall i start ? <EOS>
you can see we're we're all very far beyond the <EOS> 'cause that's one button by its the complexity of twelve buttons . <EOS> okay right , <EOS> so we're writing down four . <EOS> so we're just estimating that yeah it would be less . <EOS> okay . <EOS> no . <EOS> yep . <EOS> yep . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> um but then you have you could either do it by raised type , <EOS> which could be you know , iffy , <EOS> um sort of old-fashioned in a way . <EOS> either that or just have it by shape , <EOS> for example you have a specific triangular shape that you know you're looking at the up and down arrow . <EOS> and then the round ones you sort of feel by , you know , that's the second one down , that sort of thing . <EOS> so it's sort of looking into how we wanted t to do it by feel . <EOS> okay . <EOS>
yeah , we can make it possible to do that , yeah . <EOS> yeah yeah . <EOS> yeah alright , oh right . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , yeah . <EOS> so <EOS> we're going for an l_c_d_ screen ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> would be yeah . <EOS>
the problem is if i we are bla if a customer wants a certain component , and doesn't want the parental control because it's a couple who do not have children <EOS> when you sell the product in the market you could meet any kind of people , <EOS> and not all people will need all the functionalities we propose to them . <EOS> so we might lose the customer because of this . <EOS> i don't know , <EOS> what do you think uh ? <EOS>
mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . yeah . <EOS> it will appeal f for dif for different reasons <EOS> but it's it's uh <EOS> yeah yeah <EOS> so i i yeah i <EOS> yeah <EOS> i think just the simplicity of it <EOS> and <EOS> yeah , yeah . <EOS> yeah , yeah . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> we can like the price to create it will be significantly less . <EOS> um , we'd like to , um to , uh , make fifty million euro . <EOS> i'm assuming that's what the m_ means . <EOS> um , and make it for an international market . <EOS> um , one thing we'd have to think about internationally is in the design of , um , like different kinds of , uh , v_c_r_s . <EOS> things like that , depending on which country you are . <EOS> another thing for the design team to think about . <EOS> um , we want it to cost , uh , absolute maximum of twelve euro and fifty cents . <EOS>
right , that's what i meant . <EOS> we could think about it and come back to it next meeting . <EOS> we still have one more meeting . <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah . alright . <EOS> okay . <EOS> so we've covered that first category , <EOS> user interface concept , <EOS> meaning design . <EOS>
so uh who want to start the the presentation of what they did ? <EOS> mm . f do you want to start ? <EOS> make a start yeah . <EOS> so . <EOS> cable , camera . <EOS> should be in my in their folder <EOS> no ? <EOS> up . <EOS>
not one colour , but the pattern needs to be recognisable . <EOS> mm . <EOS> not necessarily even if i it just has to ye <EOS> but you have to look at the product and instantly know that it's one of our products <EOS> as opposed to a sony product or a , you know , a panasonic product . <EOS> it's got to <EOS> so maybe , so you can have a look at our our other products and see if they all follow a s similar vein , perhaps . <EOS>
simple circuit board . <EOS> simple push button . <EOS> okay . um . <EOS> okay . <EOS> w w kinetic . <EOS> you were you were wanting to go for the kinetic power supply . <EOS> and it says that <EOS> i think it said the cost of that isn't too much . <EOS>
i mean fruit-shaped . don't you say that you cannot do double shape uh curved shape <EOS> yeah . <EOS> but yeah <EOS> it's it's <EOS> yeah <EOS> that's a <EOS> we're to look for <EOS> and and s we're to see the whether rubber is expensive <EOS> and d <EOS>
okay . <EOS> yeah , we could do that . <EOS> that was the idea , <EOS> or just uh release one . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> just give five with them , just in a box . five different <EOS> yeah , uh <EOS> or just uh sell different ones . <EOS>
yeah , okay . <EOS> yeah ? is this a opportunity , <EOS> or you don't want a different <EOS> yeah , of course uh . <EOS> uh but i think we we should bu uh put 'em on top of each other , <EOS> so <EOS> why ? <EOS> because then it's it's easy to know m if i push the the the up <EOS>
yeah , functional design , <EOS> and you <EOS> okay . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> we have to justify that price by having sufficient features to make it sell at that price . <EOS> that's right . <EOS> that's right . <EOS> and , you know , specifi you you will get specific um instructions for that . <EOS> i think that's the end of the show . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so um we have <EOS> well , we have a twen two two two three minutes . <EOS> um any questions at this point ? <EOS> or uh suggestions ? <EOS>
so <EOS> i think it can be just a menu which can be controlled with a left , right , up , down and enter . <EOS> so it gives instructions <EOS> but uh it has to be with an back light somehow . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so , <EOS> its main purpose in fact is a back light , <EOS> which change colours , <EOS> which makes it easier to find , <EOS>
now , uh the discussion i guess is um does anyone of you have experience with remote control ? <EOS> oops . <EOS> yeah , of course , using remote control . yeah . <EOS> i exp i s 'cause we we use 'em we use 'em , right , everyday . <EOS> and um <EOS>
every button , every individual button , has its own morse code . <EOS> suppose uh the uh user has pressed butto button one , then it will have a spe the circuit will generate a specific morse code to b that that button , <EOS> and the transistor will amplify the signal and send then to the l_e_d_ which translates the signal into infrared light . <EOS> like you have got a signal by pressing a button . <EOS> that's a d a morse code has been generated by the integrated circuit . <EOS> now , that signal , that morse code , has to be amplified by the transistor . <EOS> that is the use of transist transistor we which we use in the remote controller . <EOS> it will amplify the signal and it will send it to the l_e_d_ and which translates the signal into an infra infrared bits . <EOS> the sensor on the t_v_ can see the infrared light , and seeing the signal seeing the signal re it reacts appropriately , <EOS> that when it sees the amplified mo morse code signal , then it will uh it will uh know which uh what what action it has to uh do . <EOS> then it will do the appropriate action . <EOS> so uh this is how the remote controller works . <EOS>
li uh a d ad uh electronic uh <EOS> infrared light . <EOS> yes , <EOS> uh , okay . um <EOS> w <EOS> after it's being composed by the chip uh the signal uh is transported uh to the infra-red bulb , <EOS> and from there it signals a morse code-like signal to the to the b to the bulb in uh in the television set . <EOS>
technologies , uh . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> makes it possible to <EOS> yeah . <EOS> but then you should also find a place <EOS> you could if you do it like this you could put it in a corner or something . <EOS> you can talk into the corner . <EOS>
um , i think one thing is that it should be easy to find <EOS> bec yeah bec <EOS> i was thinking that too . <EOS> i think we should design something that has like a so you can like somehow like you <EOS> i mean you always know where your t_v_ is , so just have a call button , <EOS> i've always wanted that , <EOS> so like you can push a button on your t_v_ <EOS> yeah , yeah yeah yeah , <EOS> so you should have a call button on your television to be able to find your remote control . <EOS>
here we go . <EOS> right so <EOS> i'm gonna talk about the technical technical functions design of the remote control um . <EOS> we need to start by considering what a remote control actually is . <EOS> it's a device that allows us to produce certain effects on our television , <EOS> so i it's basically a communication device . <EOS> we we tell the remote control what we want to do , <EOS> it sends a message to the television <EOS> saying change the channel , <EOS> change the volume , <EOS> uh yeah , <EOS> adjust these settings , <EOS> adjust the brightness . <EOS> um how do we actually go about designing a new television remote control ? <EOS> first thing to do is to come up with the design specifications . <EOS> we need to know what our final product is gonna be like , <EOS> so we need a a clear idea of exactly what this product does , <EOS> uh how it works , <EOS> and what the end-user is gonna want from this product . <EOS> um . oh , <EOS> a way i'd suggest that we could go about this is by designing uh several different prototypes of user interfaces for this product , <EOS> um and then uh trying to get some feedback uh about <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> i have to draw . <EOS> so um <EOS> l <EOS> why don't you draw uh your favourite animal on on th on the white-board . <EOS> m my my favourite animal . <EOS> sorry <EOS> this is all tangled up here . <EOS> oh , i see uh <EOS>
maybe we can use uh <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> no , <EOS> maybe we can implement the scroll button ? <EOS> or a joystick like ? <EOS> mm . <EOS> there are other ways too . <EOS> just look if you look at telephones . the sony telephone has a scroll button which is very useful in searching names or <EOS>
the t_v_ . <EOS> i think that that's fine just for the t_v_ . <EOS> i mean how often does the average user need to do that kind of stuff ? <EOS> well , the other option is sort of like down at the bottom , like farther away , <EOS> you just have this sort of box inset where it's like the buttons that you don't use as much , but occasionally you will use . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> but yeah it it depends on the <EOS> so maybe you maybe you can display a banana on the l_c_d_ . <EOS> oh , so you want the remote control to be the shape of a fruit , <EOS> or you want just some kind of like fruit logo on the <EOS>
all right . <EOS> oh i don't know how that got there . <EOS> uh anyway . <EOS> who wrote that one ? <EOS> thank <EOS> so we need to close this meeting , <EOS> yeah bravo . congratulations . <EOS> thanks guys . <EOS> cool . <EOS> good job guys . <EOS>
oh okay oh like a wave , okay . <EOS> alright that makes sense okay . <EOS> um okay , with the interface we have the following options , <EOS> we can u we can use push buttons , <EOS> we can use a scroll wheel with an integrated push button , <EOS> and l_c_d_ display , <EOS> or multiple scrolling wheels . <EOS>
it <EOS> yes , <EOS> it could be uh adv advertisement feature , um rather than design feature , <EOS> you know , drawing attention to that . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> and it also paid um lip service in the instruction manual , <EOS> 'cause it's very simple <EOS> so putting it down in words should be helpful . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah . like roller for the <EOS> yeah . okay . <EOS> what about the settings of the t_v_ ? <EOS> because it's button we don't use very often , but it's we need it anyway . <EOS> so <EOS> so uh we don't have any uh we don't have uh <EOS> we should just design the remote control and we sh we don't have any access to the to the t_v_ design or we can change some design . <EOS> because one solution for this um uh uh ch changing channels is to see a summary of all channels , some some preview of all channels <EOS> and then you can <EOS> yeah . yeah b <EOS> not on the control , on the screen , on the t_v_ screen . <EOS> and then <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . yeah . <EOS> yeah , yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> okay , so fifteen to thirty five , look fairly young . <EOS> you know , they have bit of expendable income to spend on this sort of thing . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
okay . yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so w yeah . <EOS> but we still keep the flipping mechanism . <EOS> think so . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah we keep the flip ? <EOS> keep the flip live . <EOS> yeah because i think it will feel weird if you would make this smaller and this bigger or something that <EOS> i dunno . <EOS>
i think one that works would be good . <EOS> i think one that doesn't have lots of superfluous functions . <EOS> like i've got one at home <EOS> that has well , apart from the obvious , channels , channel up , channel down , volume , <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> i quite like the shape . i quite like the design of that , <EOS> uh 'cause that could sit on its own and it's quite got a quite steady base . <EOS> yeah . okay , yeah , that's good . <EOS> groovy . <EOS> okay . but yeah <EOS>
that's just as e just as easy . <EOS> uh . i i do <EOS> yeah . yeah , that's true , that's true . <EOS> uh i do agree , <EOS> because well , it's just not the same when you touch a touch screen <EOS> or when you touch a button , <EOS> but well we have to look at what's our target uh audience . <EOS> w we are aiming for younger people <EOS> and they they chose <EOS>
mm . <EOS> no . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so like what i said , you probably need like a battery and something else . <EOS> um and the kinetic one i guess for me is the most interesting one <EOS> because it's movement and people like to fiddle with their <EOS> and it's a nice sales gimmick i think . <EOS> from a marketing gimmick it it's a technology thing , <EOS> it's a shake it it doesn't work , shake it , knock it or something . <EOS> you know <EOS> you know <EOS> you have you had those balls , you know those stress balls where you bounce the ball and it and it lights up and it goes , <EOS> you know that might be a gimmick combined with rubber . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> so um for the case , um we told we were making a specifica specific assumption that it would be curved in design . <EOS> course , you know , i wanted it to be expandable and shrinkable , <EOS> but um that uh doesn't seem to b be one of the choic non-option we can uh we can really seriously explore , <EOS> so then we were thinking about um rubber , <EOS> but um unfortunately that's been eliminated because of the heat uh factor <EOS> and th um there might be some problems with the m uh how it's uh goes with the board . <EOS>
yes . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> research . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yep . <EOS> that's actually good place to advertise it too . <EOS> and to work with motion pictures . <EOS> there might be some motion pictures that are coming out um that are coming out on d_v_d_ that uh they need to have a m special remote control to work with it , <EOS> so we could maybe work out a campaign with uh with sony pictures for example . <EOS> maybe some management has got uh relationships there we can leverage . <EOS>
mm-hm mm-hmm mm-hmm . <EOS> and then finally <EOS> and finally , the incorporation of a l_c_d_ or a speech recognition system in the remote control could also be interesting , <EOS> but i don't know if the budget would be large enough . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> first i'm just wondering about the l_c_d_ stuff <EOS> because uh because <EOS>
it's it it's no , well , <EOS> it's it'll recognize uh i guess keywords , but you know keywords in a certain order like a phrase . <EOS> you train it for a certain uh , for a certain phrase , <EOS> you say <EOS> the the example they said that they have uh up and running with their prototype is um <EOS> well they've actually integrated into the into the the coffee machine that uh that we're producing is , <EOS> you can say good morning to the coffee machine and it can recognize that phrase and it'll playback good morning , how would you like your coffee ? <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm , mm-hmm . <EOS> okay . <EOS> mm-hmm , mm-hmm , mm-hmm . <EOS> in-house . <EOS> in-house . <EOS> so , um <EOS> but the thing is obviously there's still gonna be a cost if you decided to integrate that because you still have to pay for the c production of the components , <EOS> so um it it <EOS> but it basically means we c we can kind of consider this from uh you know uh a theoretical or usability kind of viewpoint without worrying too much about you know how to develop it because we have this already done . <EOS>
yet on and off is p is perhaps you kno <EOS> but we don't need a special <EOS> we don't need a special options menu for the remote itself . <EOS> uh not button <EOS> mm , <EOS> no . <EOS> no , no . <EOS> okay . <EOS> oh well , <EOS> you should be able to set which t_v_ you have . <EOS> if you have if you have uh <EOS>
what kind of th thickness are we looking at ? <EOS> um , i imagine that we could specify . <EOS> um , i don't see any reason to go outside of the convention of three or four millimetres . yeah . <EOS> okay , <EOS> brilliant . <EOS> um , the buttons , there are multiple scroll buttons available from our manufacturer , <EOS> but to use those we'd have to use more chips , <EOS> um and that would cost us more . <EOS> and if we do go with the rubber doubled curved case um we'll have to use rubber push buttons <EOS> because the other buttons aren't compatible with that . <EOS> um and just a little note there , <EOS> touch screen equals many chips <EOS> which equals many euro . <EOS>
right , so <EOS> start of the first meeting . <EOS> uh . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> right , so agenda of the first meeting . <EOS> okay . <EOS> where we uh we have twenty five minutes for this meeting . <EOS> we uh are to get acquainted . <EOS>
'cause we're at lunchtime now i think . <EOS> i think it's time for us to get back to <EOS> right , okay . <EOS> i think you can email me , if there's any more questions . <EOS> um and i'll be able to not answer them . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> i spent a lot of time thinking about what i was gonna do and then a couple of minutes before this i get my function you know the information that i need . <EOS> so frustrating . <EOS> so <EOS> yeah wa wa you actually <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
ah . she . <EOS> you can look at the final report , <EOS> 'cause i have to record everything we are deciding and such , <EOS> so i'm trying to write it down between everything else . <EOS> move to meeting room . <EOS> sometimes i have these pop-ups or these sounds and there's nothing there , <EOS> and also with i don't know how to use powerpoint , so it takes me forever to get something done with it . <EOS>
yeah , <EOS> because they're right on your screen . <EOS> so you can use the b the the arrows . <EOS> huh . <EOS> they're right on your screen , <EOS> so i don't know where you'd search . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> with the ones <EOS> are all the buttons easy to find ? not only this buttons , all the buttons . <EOS>
yeah . okay . <EOS> so <EOS> paul , you can do the next one if you want . <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah well uh . <EOS> it's on the on the uh net net uh thing , <EOS> isn't it ? <EOS> there it is . <EOS> okay . <EOS> technical functions design . <EOS>
yeah . yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> it's cheaper to produce . <EOS> mm . s <EOS> and uh if the the <EOS> well if we have less technology we have more liberty to uh for the shape and uh things like that so <EOS> yeah that's right . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> i mean th the thing that i immediately comes to mind is computer mouses <EOS> which um i mean y you get all sorts of shapes in the shops <EOS> and s you know some quite fancy ones <EOS> um than the <EOS> some from personal experience which look nice <EOS> but aren't particularly comfortable . <EOS> um any thoughts about buttons or flat screens or uh uh <EOS>
yeah , <EOS> and uh and uh <EOS> it's <EOS> in uh indeed uh the languages are a difficult thing . <EOS> uh because we we have a lot of languages . <EOS> i d <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i don't think it's uh useful enough to take the effort to design something with uh speech recognition . <EOS>
is it the other shift button maybe ? <EOS> no that's fine . <EOS> um we've worked out what it would be anyway . <EOS> did you try both shift buttons ? <EOS> it could be the other side . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> cancel . piss off . <EOS> that's too bad . <EOS>
no <EOS> i'm user interf i'm user interface design . <EOS> i am the industrial design , yeah okay . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> and you ? <EOS> i am the industrial designer so . mm okay . <EOS> okay . so <EOS> what's the difference between <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
but this is what you would like to ask the user first <EOS> and i don't think the user would be ready to have a <EOS> yeah , <EOS> but <EOS> wireless remote control . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> but some pa <EOS> i don't think well , yeah , i don't think he would , <EOS> but in a sense <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah <EOS> . this is uh like the <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay <EOS> odd shape with spongy cover . <EOS> and standard battery okay , <EOS> a chip imprint , there's no specific problem . <EOS> so we agree to put the wheel <EOS>
do we do we have some time left ? <EOS> uh you have <EOS> they say it's forty minutes . <EOS> ah yes we have time later <EOS> but we don't <EOS> but we we were told we could end the final meeting at any time , whenever we felt we were finished . <EOS>
um okay , <EOS> it's big , <EOS> it's got a great memory . <EOS> does it ? oh . <EOS> supposed to have a great memory , <EOS> we say an elephant never forgets . <EOS> and uh dunno know why but looks like nice to me . <EOS> nice animal . <EOS>
is it ? <EOS> you killed a monster . <EOS> the idea is that i've set up <EOS> i've reviewed all of the um the points of discussion from the beginning , <EOS> and used that as a criteria of evaluation for the um uh for the current design uh th or the plan , <EOS> and uh so we can review that . <EOS> uh i think it's gonna end up being sort of elementary <EOS> because we're sort we're in n we're not gonna probably use it to change anything but <EOS> doesn't seem like it's going , does it ? <EOS>
an elk ? <EOS> a vicious <EOS> okay . <EOS> and it goes like <EOS> yeah it's got like big antlers , <EOS> yeah . <EOS> looks kinda like , like it has holly growing out of its head . <EOS> do you have elk where you come from ? <EOS>
oh . <EOS> du <EOS> okay . <EOS> thanks for coming to this meeting . <EOS> s <EOS> how we doing on our remote ? <EOS> we have some we have some ideas and some uh <EOS> hm . <EOS> ideas for what people want . <EOS> uh we yes s i've lo <EOS> i've done the role that i was asked to do anyway . <EOS> i think . <EOS>
be <EOS> yeah . <EOS> it'd be harder to f bu uh buttons i think . <EOS> it'd be harder to press button . <EOS> kind of like a potato . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> might <EOS> would you think you you do you think you'd be able to hold it ? <EOS> 'cause i think the reason they're long is <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
sorry . <EOS> okay <EOS> i'll just email you this file , my presentation . <EOS> so . <EOS> good . <EOS> do presentation ready ? <EOS> mm-hmm <EOS> i'm just emailing it to you . <EOS> oh okay . <EOS> so <EOS> so <EOS> did you manage uh <EOS> yeah <EOS> i sent you the slides , <EOS> you didn't see them ? <EOS>
yes , this is certain uh some contribution to our project . <EOS> so . let's see . <EOS> which animal has not been drawn yet . <EOS> and you , <EOS> mm 'kay . <EOS> your turn . <EOS> so <EOS> you've all drawn land animals , <EOS> so why not draw an animal from the water . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> look-and-feel ? <EOS> evaluation crit <EOS> no , evaluation is <EOS> yeah , evaluation presentation . <EOS> it's not in . <EOS> uh d it doesn't matter um <EOS> it only had two pages or something . <EOS> um well i looked in the reports um from the marketing strategy , <EOS> or uh of uh the the the the the the new needs and uh the market . <EOS> the italians uh , how they think about it . <EOS> and <EOS> the research uh about uh the the comp uh the the the users and that kind of stuff . <EOS> i made some criteria , <EOS> and we have to test the criteria from one to zero . <EOS> we sh we we we can give it uh a number , and then we can give ourself an average for our <EOS>
no . <EOS> no . <EOS> doing pretty well so far <EOS> aren't we ? <EOS> uh functional ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah definitely . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> um . where are we ? <EOS> found easily . <EOS> yeah <EOS> i mean that's that's <EOS> we've b built in the the speech , where are you , function . <EOS>
that was mm-hmm <EOS> is it the . <EOS> sh i think there was plenty of room . <EOS> we got a couple innovative i <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i <EOS> i think we we ended up being quite creative there . <EOS> yeah <EOS> well we we we kinda broke <EOS> we kinda at least adjusted every every criteria they gave us <EOS> because we d we still have the the teletext capability in this thing right , <EOS> we raised the price of it , we've added two t new technology to it . <EOS> so you know you know if this thing flies then we've we've adjusted or broken every every idea they gave us . <EOS>
or is the l <EOS> or put like stripes , <EOS> oh yeah , yellow lights . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> yellow could be and it could <EOS> doesn't have to be huge . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> well if you have like a <EOS> hang on . <EOS> if you have this sort of strip kind of down at the bottom the base of it , just like yellow with the r_r_ . <EOS>
that's a good advantage point as well . if we have a fancy-looking docking station <EOS> or very <EOS> that's a nice requirement . <EOS> yes . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> docking station . <EOS> you said they easily get lost as well . <EOS> yes <EOS> well <EOS> fifty percent of the people indicated that remote control tended to get lost . <EOS>
okay . okay . <EOS> no worry . <EOS> basically what we could do too is uh have a bluetooth uh integration . <EOS> so <EOS> this <EOS> oh , sorry . <EOS> wh what's that ? <EOS> so uh <EOS> oh , sorry . <EOS> we have some new uh project requirements . <EOS> we have to have a look what they are . <EOS> they're still in um <EOS> uh teletext has become outdated since the popularity of internet . <EOS> so a teletext option , maybe we have to skip that one . <EOS> i'm not sure . <EOS> i don't think so , <EOS> but <EOS>
it's crazy . so <EOS> uh-huh . <EOS> in the eighties ? <EOS> my um grammy does computer science back in the states <EOS> and so they had um an e_d_u_ and gov network . <EOS> there's basically the fundamental structures , <EOS> but it wasn't uh household to household yet <EOS> because it hadn't been <EOS>
okay . <EOS> oh <EOS> just sk <EOS> maybe you have to skip that one as well . <EOS> it's <EOS> uh i don't think a rubber case looks <EOS> uh but we have to do something about the trend . <EOS> the trend is uh spong spongy uh and uh fruit or fresh fresh . <EOS> and uh now we have nothing about uh about those those two . <EOS>
it would make sense to . i would say to . <EOS> um and we'd better be careful about the time as well . <EOS> we've already had the five minute warning , <EOS> so . um . <EOS> i would say yeah . <EOS> it would make sense if you could <EOS> okay . <EOS>
huh . <EOS> okay . <EOS> yep . <EOS> taste . <EOS> dimension as well . <EOS> i think that that's very helpful because it it starts to pop up , <EOS> whereas on a piece of paper , on a computer , on a board , um even with a three d_ graphic thing it still , it requires a lot of <EOS> yeah tangible , that's a nice word . <EOS> it becomes tangible . <EOS>
yep . <EOS> the voice recognition thing is cool . <EOS> and uh voice recognition , the software , open source software exist already . <EOS> it's a bit sketchy at some times , uh , you're not gonna get good always accurate results , <EOS> but for a very fixed number of words , <EOS> you know <EOS> you have , <EOS> how many different words can you have for a remote control , <EOS> up , down , left , right , channel five , channel seven , <EOS> you know , <EOS> how many , <EOS> you can't have that many words . <EOS> for a fixed vocabulary it works quite well . <EOS> i'm pretty sure people would buy it . <EOS> but after a while people may wanna return it , <EOS> because if you have to to say som <EOS> i mean most people use a remote control for switching to channels , <EOS> and they say they do that about ninety eight percent of the time . <EOS> using the remote control , ninety eight percent of the time for changing channels , <EOS> and that's for flickering through channels . <EOS> so if you have to say up , up , up , up , if you have to do that all the time , then people might get a bit fed up with that <EOS> and they may return it . <EOS> however , oh , because the voice recognition software exists already , <EOS> there's no need to spend money on research and development , <EOS> but this does mean the need for microphones in the in the remote control , <EOS> which is an unusual feature in my opinion . <EOS> but if we do have the voice recognition thing , there's a lot of stuff that you can uh get rid of . <EOS> see , you could <EOS> there're two options . <EOS> either you have voice recognition by itself , <EOS> which i think is a bit impractical for like night time if you wanna be watching television and you wanna be quiet , <EOS> or i don't know you have a visitor coming round and the remote's only trained for you , it's a bit impractical to have just voice recognition by itself . <EOS> so you can have voice recognition and a regular remote . <EOS> but imagine you got rid of the regular remote part , then you can design the remote to look any way you want it to look , <EOS> because there are no restrictions on physical size , or shape , <EOS> it it could be as fancy as you want it to be , <EOS> you know , <EOS> it could be like a lollipop or something like that , something weird like that . <EOS> as long as the voice recognition stuff works , that's that's fine . <EOS>
snail . <EOS> well <EOS> the snail doesn't have legs . <EOS> okay . <EOS> but a turtle has . <EOS> and those are slow . <EOS> and i hope our project group will not be slow , <EOS> but we will uh work to a good result <EOS> and do it uh as fast as we can . <EOS> okay , <EOS> time for another animal . <EOS> would you like to go next ? <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> everything , agenda . <EOS> so , like , i wonder if we might add something new to the to the remote control market , <EOS> such as the lighting in your house , or um <EOS> yeah . <EOS> or even like , you know , notes about um what you wanna watch . <EOS> like you might put in there oh i want to watch such and such and look a <EOS> oh that's a good idea . <EOS> so extra functionalities . <EOS>
it's a two , i would say two . <EOS> two ? <EOS> w w un to be one what would do we nee actually , <EOS> yeah , <EOS> i don't see <EOS> okay , <EOS> one would would be without buttons , . <EOS> two . <EOS> why it is one . <EOS>
fine . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> fine , uh we were talking of voice recognition also <EOS> because that we are not for how to look it uh remote control if it's lost . <EOS> mm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> so , are we looking at voice ? <EOS> yes , it was just , there was just a cost issue with that , <EOS> but it's a good idea <EOS> we just need to check on the cost , <EOS> is that right ? <EOS>
yeah , <EOS> 'cause the sample speaker was , i think , more complicated then just a beeping thing . <EOS> this would be <EOS> yeah , yeah yeah <EOS> there you record your samples your speech samples and <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , okay , so we <EOS>
right . so , <EOS> the way i'm gonna do this is uh we're gonna take a look at some old remote controls , see how they work , <EOS> uh reuse the the vital kind of um essential pieces of it , <EOS> and then we'll throw in our new innovations um <EOS> and keep it all within budget . <EOS>
uh i think they still do their job . <EOS> i think they're fine actually . <EOS> yeah <EOS> you can't <EOS> i am thinking outside the little square box though , with literally in like form <EOS> i don't <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> maybe a s a circle would be alright , different . <EOS>
and then do we get to make a remote control ? <EOS> 'cause we missed out . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so <EOS> it's now <EOS> i guess that we're supposed to start at fifteen thirty five , <EOS> so we've got until four fifteen . <EOS> uh-huh . <EOS> how how much do we have , forty minutes ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
there you go . <EOS> one more criteria . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> next slide . <EOS> project evaluation . <EOS> uh project process , satisfaction with , for example , room for creativity , leadership , teamwork , means , new ideas found . <EOS> um <EOS> so <EOS> i guess that <EOS> let's see here . <EOS> i think that perhaps the project evaluation's just supposed to be completed by me . <EOS> but i'd like to hear your thoughts . <EOS>
but it's <EOS> you have the lemon aspect of this th this this thing . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> maybe if you change if you take the buttons out , <EOS> and maybe do things like that <EOS> do don't do that , please . <EOS> i dunno where the lemon is , but <EOS> i mean it's not obvious . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> like like mobiles , yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> we still need the buttons in the same places thought , <EOS> don't we ? <EOS> yeah , <EOS> button will be on the upper side , buttons will be the on the upper side . <EOS> yeah , buttons will be on the upper side , lower side we will just put the casing , <EOS> so half of that will be look the <EOS> yeah , not not the upper side . <EOS> so from lower you can , <EOS> it means while you are holding of from this side you c you can have banana look or apple look , whatever . <EOS> so in that way we need not to d have different different shape mobiles everything , we will just design casings fruit shape . <EOS> and <EOS>
alright well <EOS> we can we can discuss that one further when we think about um whether th when we do costs and so forth , um . <EOS> true , if plastic is dead cheap and if we're making the whole thing out of plastic anyway um <EOS> yeah <EOS> we'll cross that bridge later um <EOS> but yeah we will have to evaluate what's most important . <EOS> um i think we've had a bit of discussion already on this thing , <EOS> n <EOS> s there any other questions comments that came up in these presentations ? <EOS>
bright yellow . <EOS> interface type . we have pushbutton , scroll-wheel interface , integrated scroll-wheel pushbutton , and an l_c_d_ display . <EOS> s <EOS> s <EOS> that's <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so we actually have the l_c_d_ display <EOS> and then <EOS> and then is it the integrated or is it <EOS>
um <EOS> do we need an l_c_d_ display ? <EOS> what what's the functionality of that ? <EOS> it's bound to increase the cost of it a lot , i would've thought . <EOS> yeah but the question is what are we using it <EOS> what would we what would we achieve from it ? <EOS> putting in lights is cheap but putting in an l_c_d_ panel just to make it glow is a bit of a <EOS>
okay . <EOS> yeah . yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> although i don't know . <EOS> so now the technical aspects of this new device . <EOS> mm . <EOS> two . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> if <EOS> you prefer it . <EOS> sorry . <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> sure . <EOS> sure . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> i i think twenty five to thirty five is is is fair to add that in as a group as well <EOS> because that's more than half your group of people who are willing to at least try and use your technology . <EOS>
pick one you like , <EOS> yes . <EOS> mm . okay . <EOS> 'kay . <EOS> that's good . <EOS> uh but the form has to be um it has to <EOS> it's has to be possible to stand up ? <EOS> or just only to lie down ? <EOS>
okay , yeah . yeah , <EOS> we can uh combine that . <EOS> uh it takes too much time to learn how to use a r new remote control . <EOS> uh i think we must t uh take a look at this . <EOS> it's only uh th thirty four of the thirty four percent . <EOS> but it's uh a tough one . <EOS> because if we make a ha whole new product , our own style , we we c uh this is so difficult , uh a difficulty i think . <EOS> uh next , remote controls are bad for r_s_i_ . <EOS> yeah , but only if they zap a lot , and they watch over five hours t_v_ or something . <EOS> i don't we we haven't <EOS> uh we mustn't look too much at uh the last point . <EOS> okay , <EOS> last page . <EOS> uh the last uh experiment uh was about gadgets , like uh speech recognition . <EOS> we didn't uh think about that already . <EOS> and uh an l_c_d_ on the remote control . <EOS> we already thought about that . <EOS>
sure why not why not <EOS> yeah , mm . <EOS> oh , <EOS> but do we want to implement that , <EOS> or ? <EOS> i think an l_c_d_ screen should be suf sufficient . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> but when you look at the percentages <EOS> yeah , <EOS> it says a lot , <EOS> but <EOS>
now there's something else uh with the little flip-up , now we're adding all kinds of things in , <EOS> but with the little flip-up , if you have a little display on the flip-up that when you close it everything is locked . <EOS> maybe the display also makes it easier to use , <EOS> because sometimes when you're looking for buttons , maybe if you see a display <EOS>
yeah , a little . <EOS> okay . <EOS> let's go on then . <EOS> well , <EOS> i think the dog is the the most uh artistic . <EOS> uh i figured the rabbit was actually the most uh impressive . <EOS> oh , sorry . <EOS> don't choose for youself . <EOS> that's selfish . <EOS>
kinetic ? <EOS> the kinetic . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> um , that means that there's no function for li the port , <EOS> you know that it sits in , then pressing the button then having <EOS> so we could incorporate voice recognition for the finding it . <EOS> it's a bi i it's like a g it's a gadget , it's a <EOS>
would you care to examine the prototypes , see how they feel in the hand ? <EOS> hold them , <EOS> you see , you know . <EOS> curvature , is it to your liking ? <EOS> oh i see , the on-off's in the back . <EOS> yes , <EOS> that's so that your index finger automatically goes straight to it . <EOS>
start to eat banana . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> okay . <EOS> congratulations to the team . <EOS> uh very well , we worked together fantastically . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> nice product . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i think it was a good collaboration uh . <EOS> so <EOS> what does the management say ? <EOS>
oh <EOS> yeah , it's kind of a penguin . <EOS> kind of looks like a penguin , like with no eye . <EOS> take me to your leader . <EOS> i like that it stands up . <EOS> mm-mm . <EOS> wow , <EOS> maybe i should market it to some remote control company now . <EOS>
yeah , i imagine some sort of vinyl thing . <EOS> yeah , yeah , yeah . <EOS> in a in a sort of a with a suede sort of feel . maybe . <EOS> well since since the since the things like the like the screen and um how to say that , solar cell has to be has to be like kept kept in the shape , <EOS> we cannot b uh <EOS> so we need that the that the peeling <EOS> uh i dunno <EOS> but we should we should take care of these two two things . <EOS> so , if if uh the solar cell won't be visible while the banana is closed , then the material must be able to put the light inside , you know . <EOS> so that we can reach the energy out of it out of that . <EOS>
fun . <EOS> wonderful <EOS> ooh . <EOS>
um well the developments ? <EOS> uh development one . <EOS> uh well <EOS> most important aspect for remote control happens to be a fancy look-and-feel . instead of the current uh functional look-and-feel . <EOS> um well fancy stands for an original look-and-feel of the case and the interface . <EOS> and the second most important aspect is that a remote control should be technological uh innovative . <EOS> um well it stands for the use of technical features that do not exist in current remote controls . <EOS> i think we pretty much covered that with our screen and um and speech recognition , <EOS> so i don't expect that to be a problem . <EOS>
okay . okay . <EOS> oh yeah okay , <EOS> perfect . <EOS> great , <EOS> thank you very much nathan . <EOS> that's perfect , <EOS> so i guess that makes sense for you to take it from here . <EOS> , you're welcome . i guess so , <EOS> 'cause i found some interesting things . <EOS>
batteries . <EOS> i think she is still finishing her . <EOS> no no no no , it's fine i'm just preparing . <EOS> it's just that <EOS> yeah , let's let's hear from you first . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> okay . <EOS> where is that thing ? <EOS> oh sorry , couldn't see . <EOS>
then we've got our first tool training . <EOS> we are going to work with a lot of high-tech tools here , <EOS> so it's ab it's handy if we have a little bit of training first . <EOS> as you can see we've got the smart boards here and here in the white board . <EOS> um in the white board here there's a little tool bar on this side . <EOS> here are some functions . <EOS> you can save . <EOS> n <EOS> uh these functions we don't have anything to do with , <EOS> only undo , you can undo a little uh piece of drawing . <EOS> a blank new document for each person . <EOS> uh select a pen , <EOS> eraser . <EOS> capture we don't have to do anything with . <EOS> uh then we've got our pen . this pen . <EOS> it's really funny <EOS> because you can draw with it on this page um in the think it is form of . <EOS> you can also select the current colour and the line width . <EOS> but then first you have to select the pen function . <EOS> but we're going to work with it in a minute . <EOS> so okay . uh <EOS> that's very simple <EOS> and it's easy to uh draw your findings and drawings on there . <EOS>
yeah , <EOS> s <EOS> round corners , but s but square , yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> but maybe then both groups won't buy it . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> uh i i if you do it uh uh square , with round corners but a little uh in the middle of it uh <EOS> i <EOS> do you know what i mean ? <EOS>
oh yeah <EOS> and th and a enter button just to select . <EOS> yeah , okay . <EOS> um i guess we're keeping s it simple . <EOS> we don't really need any other audio funct uh functions <EOS> because it's just volume up , volume down . <EOS> um up volume , yeah , i would have thought so . <EOS>
so . twenty five euro for a remote control . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> mm that's the price we want to <EOS> that's the aim for the price for the remote control . <EOS> we aim to do this profit . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> okay . <EOS> 'tis big number . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> oh <EOS> unfortunately i don't have costing information . <EOS> i i in terms of workability , i i think the the two front-runners are the standard battery or the kinetic , <EOS> but i'm sorry <EOS> i don't figures on the difference in cost . <EOS> okay . <EOS> mm 'kay . <EOS> what's the uh feelings of the group on the kinetic ? <EOS>
ah right right . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> or you c <EOS> yeah . <EOS> oh <EOS> that's good , yeah . <EOS> o or you could th think of an uh uh a small touch screen on the remote control . <EOS> yeah <EOS> b i wanted <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> not by mail . <EOS> i receiv the mail but you don't . so <EOS> no so it's a text file n in the project folder . <EOS> so teletext can be skipped . <EOS> but you you've got more information than uh . <EOS> that's in the presentation , so <EOS>
but w <EOS> yeah . <EOS> three euros . <EOS> that's on top of the sixteen , <EOS> or is it part of that ? <EOS> no no no , <EOS> part of that , yeah . <EOS> part of that . <EOS> so that takes it down to thirteen euros without the speech recognition . <EOS>
yeah , sure . <EOS> so i already uh put some pu some numbers here , okay . <EOS> we are going to go through <EOS> so this is the number the mm number of components we need for this thing . <EOS> so it appears that there were things that we didn't thought about . <EOS> uh and also things that i uh i d i forget to uh to put like solar cells . <EOS>
that's okay . <EOS> um power source , i figured , batteries , <EOS> 'cause they're easily available . <EOS> typically a remote has either two double a_s or four triple a_s , sometimes three . <EOS> uh it really kinda depends on the size of the actual remote itself . <EOS> um a large on-off button , <EOS> demographically we're moving towards an older generation of people , <EOS> so a large on-off button would probably be good . <EOS> selection button for various entertainment devices , so you want something that will permit you to select the d_v_d_ player or the t_v_ or the stereo system . <EOS>
hmm . strange . <EOS> you could select it all , <EOS> but then you can't erase . <EOS> strange . <EOS> oh , you can arrange <EOS> you can only re erase ? <EOS> oh . <EOS> erase . <EOS> when you saw th li uh <EOS> earlier when we selected it , w i couldn't erase anything . <EOS>
that ? <EOS> right , <EOS> technical functions design . <EOS> uh well <EOS> i think first off , basically i do agree with what sarah has defined as as uh your personal preferences,yeah . i think we need uh a more streamlined volume with no extraneous functions . <EOS> so <EOS> my method was to look at the existing remotes and what functions they have . <EOS> and what we all need to discuss is whether we want these functions uh pretty much the same as what existing remotes have . if we can build on this with the speech recognition , <EOS> that's not something i'd thought about at all , <EOS> but it's also something we can discuss . <EOS>
no . <EOS> yeah , it's hidden in there somewhere . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> and we do have the logo on it as well . <EOS> mm-hmm , very good . <EOS> so i think it <EOS> and it's with the the black and yellow you're even in the right colours . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> well <EOS> there's some other ones , <EOS> i will address that , <EOS> yeah . <EOS> awesome , <EOS> okay . <EOS> um we wanna know next if it's technologically innovative . <EOS> did you give a functional ? <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> she said it was one . <EOS> um is it technologically innovative ? <EOS> mm . not really , i mean not so much , <EOS> 'cause we we don't have the l_c_d_ screen , <EOS> we don't have fancy chip . <EOS> other than what it looks like , i dunno if it's really <EOS>
exactly . <EOS> shall i see if i can get across without just tangling everything . <EOS> okay . <EOS> there's one . <EOS> we've had more time to prepare over this side , <EOS> so we've all stuck our bits and pieces in our pockets . <EOS> didn't think of that . <EOS>
uh <EOS> oh dear , <EOS> it doesn't look what like what i want it to be . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> s <EOS> uh . <EOS> uh <EOS> it's not a vampire bat honestly . <EOS> okay , yeah . <EOS> uh and somewhere there's a body behind . <EOS> that's my dreadful <EOS> that's the worst yet , <EOS> that's <EOS> it's meant to be an eagle <EOS> you can tell it's a flying animal <EOS> could have been a seagull , <EOS> i never thought of a seagull . <EOS> an eagle , um again i'm thinking on my feet goodness . <EOS> i suppose they're all so independent , <EOS> i'd put that one down again . <EOS> da dum um . <EOS>
uh yeah , <EOS> just click there . <EOS> . <EOS> uh the the maximise button . <EOS> oh right . ah . <EOS> good , <EOS> this is why we need to make these things simple <EOS> so that the uh the the the boss can understand . <EOS> now <EOS> i've um <EOS> this is the company's uh uh costing for for various uh uh aspects of design <EOS> and i i i've treated some of these slightly uh liberally given the constraints placed on us , <EOS> um i wouldn't know for in <EOS> for instance if if they require us to have it in the corporate colours , then that is not a special colour , <EOS> that's a that's a standard colour . <EOS> uh , so <EOS> we're just simply on batteries , <EOS> the the one th the one decision i've had to make is that um <EOS>
okay . alright . <EOS> first we're gonna start off by using our tools . <EOS> and the whiteboard thing , do you guys wanna give that a try even though the ink wasn't working or do you wanna do it on here . <EOS> i think we should forgo the whiteboard since we can't actually see what we're writing . <EOS>
do we have both sides ? <EOS> can we ? <EOS> mm yeah . <EOS> we should probably make it that you have to depress it to activate it then , <EOS> 'cause oth otherwise you're not just holding it and going like this , you know . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> that's squishy . that's squishy . <EOS>
one of the great uh advantages of the l_c_d_ screen you just use some or uh another uh cleaning uh uh cl some cleaning stuff . <EOS> and um it should be made of strong plastic <EOS> and it should be bright . <EOS> well <EOS> i already uh s uh explained some properties of that material <EOS> and i think <EOS> uh well <EOS> we also we almost concluded about that <EOS> uh this should uh be uh our uh button component . <EOS> so uh <EOS>
oh , next . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> oh and save this uh board . <EOS> huh ? <EOS> yeah i'll just i'll just keep it there . <EOS> just save it . <EOS> yeah okay <EOS> but just press save and uh <EOS> yeah . <EOS> it'll be fine . <EOS>
it's just wheat , <EOS> it's the stuff that your mom could make with preservatives and uh <EOS> wow , hmm . <EOS> yeah um so to <EOS> wha what are your summarising words about play-doh ? <EOS> it's helpful to the creative process . <EOS> um it engages all your senses not just your sight , but your sense of feel your sense of touch . <EOS> and it helps you to understand <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> well <EOS> i was sort of mm kinda picturing like maybe um a shape that's almost like a mouse . <EOS> so that , you know , when they hold it it's <EOS> because a mouse is pretty comfortable to hold in your hand <EOS> um maybe we could make it a slightly different shape <EOS> so they could hold on to it , <EOS> but that way they can have the volume on the side and then the channel buttons and <EOS>
oh no , ethics , that's gonna cost us money . <EOS> so we have to safety point of view also , we have to take care . <EOS> okay , safety . <EOS> oh i think wi with the more organic shape of it it won't be as it won't as have many sharp corners as that , so that's something good , um <EOS>
so it's now like a two-part thing . <EOS> okay . alright . <EOS> yeah , so it would be a two part package . <EOS> okay . <EOS> so we get to design that too . <EOS> make it fashionable . <EOS> um , okay . <EOS> so do you think even though we're not talking about speek speech recognition our target group should still be teenagers and young professionals . <EOS> huh . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> thank you for uh your suggestion <EOS> and i i will make a summary of that meeting that i will put in the shared folder you can't see <EOS> and uh and then you will um you will be able to to see what has been uh has been said on on this meeting and and what has been decided . <EOS> uh maybe for next meeting uh send me your presentation before by email so that we can see them uh altogether . <EOS> that would be easier . <EOS>
uh um . <EOS> it it might be , <EOS> 'cause that's our corporate colour , <EOS> isn't it ? <EOS> that's right , yeah , <EOS> corporate colour , we didn't keep that in <EOS> um well <EOS> if we <EOS> i know it would make it a little less c a little more confusing , <EOS> but if we had all the buttons in black , and a design in and the outside in yellow , that'd be our corporate one <EOS> and we could also have alternative colours , one a more conservative one , one that's more fruity . <EOS>
any thing that are like free . <EOS> oh yeah <EOS> two two bucks . <EOS> where are you from in california by the way ? <EOS> i grew up in san diego , <EOS> but <EOS> yeah um <EOS> la jolla , p_b_ . <EOS> did you really ? <EOS> what part ? <EOS> yeah <EOS> i'm from san diego as well . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> it's for , like , the ultimately lazy people , <EOS> who can't even be bothered to pick up the remote . <EOS> ooh . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm yeah . <EOS> maybe <EOS> i mean if i get m more numbers , i'll e-mail you before the next meeting in terms of ages . <EOS> but this doesn't divide up anything <EOS> and there was only a hundred subjects also , <EOS> which isn't , i mean , really isn't that representative , <EOS> especially if it's a hundred subjects that th they then can subdivide into age groups that means there's very few in each age group , <EOS> so <EOS>
thanks . <EOS> alright , okay . <EOS> well since you guys have chosen the ones i wanted to do , i'll have to have to go for something a bit random . <EOS> does it look like a dog actually ? <EOS> okay . <EOS> and also , my drawing skill isn't that great so , yeah . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> oh really ? <EOS> huh . <EOS> well , <EOS> we have a <EOS> no , me neither . <EOS> it's a <EOS> kind of broad t_v_ at home , and a d_v_d_ player , <EOS> so we got like a lot of remote controls , one for the t_v_ , one for the video recorder , one for the d_v_d_ player . <EOS> and i think it's it would be best to just make one remote control that can operate them all . <EOS>
think we're being generous here with three . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah . okay . <EOS> reduce the number of unused buttons . <EOS> we're down to t two buttons , <EOS> is it ? <EOS> okay . <EOS> two buttons . <EOS> two buttons and a joystick . <EOS>
so we need up , down , and side-to-side buttons . <EOS> well , that could be <EOS> no <EOS> you could just double up with like the channel or the volume buttons . <EOS> for the menus . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> that's true . <EOS> yeah , okay . <EOS>
so <EOS> yeah . <EOS> ca <EOS> can i ask a question . <EOS> this seven inch t_f_t_ screen , <EOS> how big is it in reality ? <EOS> yeah ? <EOS> well , seven to seven inches . <EOS> so like that . <EOS> yes . <EOS> that's quite big . <EOS>
yep . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> yeah , that's true . <EOS> yeah , press that <EOS> is t <EOS> yeah , <EOS> that might work . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> it's like um <EOS> yeah , <EOS> it's like the mouse where you just kinda click it . you just press it . <EOS>
this is actually i mean this probably <EOS> this probably actually costs more than three <EOS> if you <EOS> yeah <EOS> so let's put one here in the then instead of single <EOS> oka all right . <EOS> so we stick to plastic , it cost nothing . <EOS> okay . okay . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> great leadership . <EOS> excellent leadership . <EOS> thank you very much . <EOS> you're all get you're all getting a raise . <EOS> uh teamwork . i thought went well . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , everyone got enough input , i think . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> um <EOS> i think we should start by by choosing a case . <EOS> because that's the basis you're building on . <EOS> yeah yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> um yeah <EOS> just <EOS> so <EOS> i could draw them out . <EOS> let's look at the flat case . <EOS> oh . <EOS> it's from the side <EOS> so it's rather normal . <EOS> the the single curved so i'm not really sure what they're gonna look like , but i think it's something like this . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i think we all made um very significant contributions , <EOS> i don't think anybody dominated it , <EOS> which i thought was really good , <EOS> like each of us was able to um like each of you had your information <EOS> and i uh i tried to facilitate it without like taking over , um <EOS>
right . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> and it'll make the costs <EOS> yeah . <EOS> right . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> uh i think the co costs will also play a big role when we come to know about them . <EOS> so well we can probably wait until t we have more knowledge on that . <EOS> uh i if the if the costs allow , we can have like an l_c_d_ display <EOS> and uh with um <EOS> because we do want something fancy and fashionable as well . <EOS> so yeah ? cool . <EOS>
fold open , <EOS> where you can see uh more options . i think <EOS> ah <EOS> that's that's <EOS> yeah <EOS> n <EOS> yeah , <EOS> something uh on top , just dren general things like volume and t_v_ channels and inside things you don't use that often . <EOS>
then you could probably afford this . <EOS> oh no no . <EOS> i would say thirty five to forty . <EOS> yeah , i was gonna say thirty five to fifty . <EOS> 'kay . <EOS> thirty five to fifty euros is our sales bracket okay . <EOS> so the question is what we ca we make it for . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> i don't i don't see it , <EOS> and to me if i'm gonna market a product for b for beauty for for design i'm gonna i'm gonna try to market it at a much higher price . <EOS> i need to make it special with a high price tag . <EOS> i don't want to make it economically uh g uh competitive . <EOS> i want i want to market it as exclusive . <EOS> so i would market this product it at eighty-nine euros <EOS> and come up with some really beautiful exterior design or something <EOS> th but but i don't think we have that flexibility . <EOS>
uh that is possible yeah . <EOS> right . we may not need it . <EOS> so we just remove our <EOS> screen . <EOS> make it a bigger dial . <EOS> easier to use . <EOS> even easier to use then . <EOS> screen here . <EOS> okay , the <EOS>
i love cats , too . <EOS> i'm a cat person . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i'm allergic to cats . <EOS> oh , okay . <EOS> ah . <EOS> uh . <EOS> i'm allergic to cats , too . <EOS> if you're around one <EOS> i had a roommate who was um allergic , but if she was around my cat forever she became used to it , you know , <EOS> it's weird . <EOS>
well th the on the thing is though , most remote controls are used by more than one person . <EOS> so unless you're kind of targeting single people you know you're gonna maybe <EOS> yeah . <EOS> cut out some a lot of your market . <EOS> i dunno <EOS> i th anyway i think it could be int interesting to to release some a a small fraction of of this remote controls . <EOS> sorry ? <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> ok yeah , that can we we can consider , <EOS> because like it won't take much money i guess , <EOS> because <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> so <EOS> this device on n that can be used for speech recognition could also be used for just uh the finding it basically , <EOS> instead of clapping why not just be ask . <EOS>
come on , try try to be nice . <EOS> gi give me a reasonable date . <EOS> yes , i ha i have no constraints , so it's fine . <EOS> ch <EOS> um we have the don't forget we have the other meeting the m_d_m_ meeting in the morning , <EOS> so it would have to be in the afternoon . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah , sure . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> new creativity . <EOS> yep . <EOS> right . <EOS> so you think a more relaxed atmosphere would be more kind of conducive to creative thought or <EOS> not not so much an atmosphere , <EOS> the atmosphere is very relaxed , <EOS> but the the gear <EOS> yeah <EOS> you know that creates boundaries to that um <EOS> and and the time the time given also restricts <EOS>
was there a questionnaire already sent ? <EOS> no , it hasn't been . <EOS> do we have to go back into the other room or can we stay in here now ? <EOS> i don't see why you can't stay here , really . <EOS> okay , so the other way . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> but <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , sure . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> so <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so they'll not sh not shy away from something quite high-tech . <EOS> that that's that's a good point . <EOS>
okay <EOS> i'm gonna have to i'm gonna have to call this to a close 'cause we're way over time . <EOS> so um that's really good , <EOS> like we've s had much to talk about that um pretty much run out of time to do so . <EOS> so off you go and design stuff <EOS> wooh . <EOS>
i dunno . <EOS> i don't think it's quite as fashionable as my robot remote <EOS> i do like uh the little martian one . <EOS> or alien or whatever he was . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> the toggle on off switch , it's really appealing . <EOS> number . <EOS>
if we lose the scroll wheel and make it totally uh depending uh dependent on uh the touch screen <EOS> s <EOS> touch . <EOS> a push , <EOS> yeah . <EOS> then it's possible to make . <EOS> and then you can and then you can add to the colours . <EOS>
superb . <EOS> mm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> though if y if you've got something like sky anyway you can just click on it <EOS> you can just press the button on the programme once and it'll record that programme when it's on <EOS> and you press it on it twice and it'll record the whole series . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> how d i'm wondering how how ou how our target price compares with the the typical price of these things . <EOS> i expect an industrial designer should know that , <EOS> but if we're aiming to to build this thing for twelve euros fifty , um is that a lot or a little ? <EOS>
i mean maximum we have another four point three euros i mean four thirty . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> well um that's <EOS> but i mean we have no way of presenting that to management as you know as a f finished , as a finished product and saying okay with the voice recogniser that costs so much . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> or we might have to suffer badly for this one as well . <EOS> yellow courgette . <EOS> well <EOS> i mean it's probably more fruit and veg than most other things out there bar fruit and veg , <EOS> so , what , four ? <EOS> four ? <EOS> oh that's it's very ambitious , <EOS> yeah , um . <EOS>
shall i go uh next ? <EOS> yep . <EOS> 'kay . <EOS> please . <EOS> so . <EOS> smoking . <EOS> well uh , <EOS> my name's , <EOS> and i looked at uh technical functions design of the remote . <EOS> uh i did this by uh looking at examples of other remote controls , of how they uh they look , and information from the web that i found . <EOS>
in the market . <EOS> what about a <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so . well . no . <EOS> time is running , <EOS> we have to close the meeting in a few minutes . <EOS> so , okay , the next step , <EOS> you can come back to your seat . <EOS> the next step is to go for to f is to go to uh <EOS>
so <EOS> let's start our second me meeting on conceptual design . <EOS> so , <EOS> as the previous meeting i will be the secretary <EOS> and we will have three presentations <EOS> and we'll have to decide on the remote control concept <EOS> and finally we'll close the decision . <EOS> so <EOS> i will first uh <EOS>
it isn't hard , no . <EOS> i think i think this is a two , personally . <EOS> two . <EOS> that it's hard to lose ? <EOS> yeah , <EOS> it it is there's the <EOS> it's a six , you think ? <EOS> no . <EOS> isn't hard to lose . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> we certainly are , <EOS> mm . yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yes . <EOS> so i would say that's the end of that meeting . <EOS> yeah , it was a pleasure working with you . <EOS> thank you , team . <EOS> it was very productive day and <EOS>
uh , in the project i'm supposed to be the technic . <EOS> 'kay . so my name's bob morris . <EOS> i'm the marketing expert for this project . <EOS> bob yeah . <EOS> bob , <EOS> okay . <EOS> my name is hamed getabdar , <EOS> and uh i'm going to be interface designer in this project . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> . <EOS> um <EOS> i think having a shape could be a little ridiculous , <EOS> like <EOS> yeah . <EOS> well we have it banana-shaped already , kind of . <EOS> so <EOS> well we kinda do yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> well perhaps the implied shape will be enough to lure that fruit-minded remote buyer . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yes , <EOS> rather than the uh the the traditional <EOS> in fact , um i won't even go that far . <EOS> um something like this shape , <EOS> you know , <EOS> sort of something that you can that's sort of a more vertical shape , <EOS> um that you you sort of hold in your hand , <EOS> um , well <EOS> i'm trying to think <EOS> uh uh uh l uh l such as i mean um something you hold up like that , <EOS> possibly with a couple of buttons like that , <EOS> but with the the entire top with the , you know , the uh the infrared or whatever source . <EOS>
wait a minute . <EOS> i thought it was the other way round too . <EOS> well uh <EOS> sh <EOS> yeah <EOS> i i was thinking one means no points , you know , all the way up to the top . <EOS> yeah yeah . <EOS> it was one is true and false is seven . <EOS> i should've kept the table up . <EOS>
since it's the only one of its kind on the market it's obviously gonna be ours . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> did we <EOS> i know at the last meeting we spoke about a beeper , <EOS> i think that was you talked about a beeper for a location , <EOS> have we just rejected that in favour of voice recognition then ? <EOS>
ah . <EOS> thirty minutes ? <EOS> thirty minutes , <EOS> the <EOS> how minutes ? <EOS> failure . <EOS> uh uh the specifi uh specific instructions for the next uh meeting you will all will receive uh at the uh the the email . <EOS> i don't think i can uh say much about it , <EOS> so uh uh wait for your email <EOS> and uh hopefully you get it done uh in the in the thirty minutes , <EOS> and i w will see you after the lunch break and the thirty minutes . <EOS> yeah ? <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> just just a quick thing about the um <EOS> about what you're saying about the uh does does it need to be fashionable ? <EOS> the sort of <EOS> i i had a quick look at the company website <EOS> and it's like the the uh we put the fashion into electronics , <EOS> so i think think the whole design thing might be qui <EOS> i mean you don't you you can still have plastic <EOS> and it'd look quite good but <EOS>
yep . <EOS> okay . <EOS> i'll hand it off to you <EOS> and um <EOS> does anyone <EOS> do you wanna go first ? <EOS> so we can maybe see what uh what the people want . <EOS> sure . <EOS> what was it ? function ? <EOS> eight . f_ eight . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> we have included a button which is fluorescent green colour <EOS> and this is the menu button which will control the colour , sharpness , brightness <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> of the screen . mm , mm-hmm . <EOS> of this uh picture . <EOS> we have also included a button which is called as the swapping button . <EOS> now this is uh a special , special feature which we have included . <EOS> now this button is an elongated shaped button and this is slightly flexible <EOS> so if it is turned towards the right it will take to the previous channel , if it is turned towards the right it will take to the next channel . <EOS> it will take the user to the previous and the next channel <EOS> so this is a swapping button . <EOS>
were too big . <EOS> they're c uh just generally japanese people have smaller hands so they couldn't get round the controller <EOS> which is uh so if you i don't know what 'cause you <EOS> obviously you can have bigger buttons for some countries or something and smaller ones for others . <EOS>
okay , right . <EOS> and uh it was quite uh a swish model , <EOS> where it can control uh four devices , t_v_ , cable , satellite , video , d_v_d_ , audio . <EOS> um so that's a bit of competition there . <EOS> so <EOS> i mean maybe it's better not to try and compete with that sort of thing <EOS> and just to market it as a completely different um like different viewpoint as a kind of finding your lost control <EOS> rather than trying to compete with the functions . <EOS> um the scroll buttons , as you've already mentioned , um
okay . <EOS> aye sir . <EOS> okay <EOS> then i'll meet you in about a half an hour , i think . <EOS> so good luck . <EOS> half an hour . <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> yep . <EOS> okay . <EOS>
you know , <EOS> yes . <EOS> um <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yes . <EOS> that's right , <EOS> and <EOS> but like if if then everybody is is is tired of the fluorescent blue and of the striped or whatever they have as another one in the package , <EOS> then they can go to the store and for a few uh francs or euros whatever they can buy <EOS> an alternate package with another two colours in it you know for example you know . <EOS>
oh really ? <EOS> okay . <EOS> but ever everything else was satisfactory ? <EOS> is that good <EOS> yeah . <EOS> the computer programmes are good . <EOS> the <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> it could be really straightforward for the computer . <EOS> i think the only thing was having to remember to you know to tick the okays <EOS> but i think i was the only one who struggled with that . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> uh having a think about the feature of ea the features of each ones , <EOS> mm . <EOS> um what functions we actually need , <EOS> and then how to group and arrange these on the actual the actual plastic or rubber hand-held piece . <EOS> uh i've been especially interested in the ipod style scroll wheel , <EOS> which <EOS>
mm yeah sure . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> ma i <EOS> i think uh for next meeting we c you two can present a real design . uh so drawing it on the board . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yea <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> okay . <EOS> perfect yeah . <EOS>
play with play-dough . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> uh can i just get some things clear just for my sake . <EOS> our energy source is gonna be <EOS> yeah , certainly , of course . <EOS> i think i think we decided that we're gonna for <EOS> for simplicity of , you know , manufacturing and uh maintenance that we will go for a a long term battery source um , <EOS> i <EOS> you know , <EOS> on the basis that um that , <EOS> you know , <EOS> if we're going for making it a fashion statement , then uh people are more likely to change it anyway uh before i it runs out <EOS> and um make an assumption that we we can aim for a battery that will last most people for uh we'll say at least five five ten years <EOS> and that we'll w we will guarantee it for for five years um . <EOS>
alright . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> and ryan you work on um how how well they'll work with the us with the user . so both of those concepts . <EOS> how well it'll work <EOS> yeah . <EOS> and uh okay <EOS> i think we made some good progress here . <EOS> see you in <EOS>
we had play-doh fun . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> no , not really . <EOS> right , <EOS> uh anything else to say on teamwork at all ? <EOS> okay , <EOS> um what about the you know how we used the whiteboard , the digital pens , the projector , stuff like that ? <EOS> um did anybody think anything was like really useful , <EOS> anything was pretty un f <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> are there some buttons ? okay . <EOS> yeah , this function is just for your browsing , from one channel to th the next one , the next s sn s , the th the third one . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> it's not what you said previously . <EOS> previously you said that turning this was the fine <EOS>
oh no <EOS> that's <EOS> i think i all wrong . <EOS> either of you want to uh say anything ? <EOS> uh . <EOS> mm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> before i uh <EOS> ps <EOS> i don't think so , <EOS> i mean <EOS> i think we worked well together <EOS> and looked really at what the consumers wanted and what we were trying to make <EOS> and you know , <EOS> seemed to discuss things pretty well <EOS> and come to group consensus <EOS> and <EOS>
mm . <EOS> there are several companies that have gone that way . <EOS> mm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> and you can even have an a movie that you can rotate the object and look at the di <EOS> the only thing that you're missing really is the weight . <EOS>
okay , okay . <EOS> sorry could you repeat that last part ? <EOS> um , okay on we've got the flip the flip-screen , the top one is gonna be the l_c_d_ and the bottom one is gonna be the rubberised buttons . <EOS> l_c_d_ screen . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> okay . <EOS>
yeah <EOS> i mean with that many options , you'd uh i'd think that the screen would be better , <EOS> because you could have that menu option , sort of <EOS> i would think so too , like <EOS> so i mean <EOS> and it seems it w <EOS> it does seem a little silly to have this screen if you hardly are ever using it , you know , <EOS> because <EOS> but then again it would <EOS> it does make kind of <EOS> if the screen's sort of just like an option that , like , is just there and you're not really using it , that's kind of <EOS> m yeah . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yes . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> good point <EOS> because we need the symbols 'cause we're going into an international market we can't have anything that's language dependent . <EOS> yes . <EOS> yeah of course , <EOS> and also <EOS>
'kay . <EOS> there's um actually no rechargeable option available , <EOS> so we <EOS> i saw the um the standard double a_ and triple a_ <EOS> which we thought were a bit bit too bulky at the moment , <EOS> dynamo charging , <EOS> i thought that that might be a bit silly to be to be honest , <EOS> people won't <EOS> it's it's basically like wind-up radio . <EOS> so you wind up your remote control before you use it . <EOS> it might <EOS>
well we're to go for the international market rather than a local market <EOS> but that that wouldn't necessarily preclude <EOS> the one thing that you can often do with products is you can uh make small modifications . <EOS> so you have your basic model which you would sell at whatever , <EOS> and then you could have additional features <EOS> in you know like a <EOS> you'd have model one , model two and model three , <EOS> and therefore you can sub-divide your market up . <EOS> but that's really where your field is . <EOS>
magic man . <EOS> so uh yeah , looking inside a a very simple remote control . <EOS> um this is what they sent me . <EOS> 'kay . here's uh the competition , i suppose . <EOS> um you open it up , there's a circuit board inside , <EOS> um <EOS> and there's a a chip , a processor , <EOS> the t_a_ one one eight three five , which um receives input from the buttons , <EOS> and ch <EOS>
um here are two example remotes . <EOS> um by the look of it they both have um kind of play and fast forward , rewind functions , <EOS> so i think they incorporate a kind of video function which we won't have to worry about . <EOS> uh but as you can see , the left remote is quite um quite busy looking , quite complicated . <EOS> um whereas the right remote is much simpler , <EOS> it looks much more user friendly . <EOS> um so my personal preference would be the right remote . <EOS> so , it's got nice big buttons , <EOS> it's got a very limited number of buttons . <EOS> um they're nice , <EOS> kinda clearly labelled . <EOS> um i like the use of the kind of um symbols like the triangles and the squares and the arrows as well as the words on the um kind of play functions and all that . <EOS> so it's very very user friendly , <EOS> and it's got a little splash of colour . <EOS> could maybe do with some more colour . <EOS> um . <EOS>
no . <EOS> mm-hmm . okay . <EOS> so <EOS> maybe we can start with this , <EOS> uh , calling this one . <EOS> okay . yep . <EOS> so <EOS> it's the pink . <EOS> th th this is the first design . <EOS> and the other one's green . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> so what do we do . <EOS> we're told okay um think in terms of style and look and feel and technology , but build something for twelve and a half pounds , <EOS> so actually the creativity was more more of like a um a f sort of a f formality then an actual <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> for volume . <EOS> yep . <EOS> but we have a frequency of how what people use a remote control for most . <EOS> um , power is used like once per hour , <EOS> channel selection is used a hundred and sixty eight per hour , <EOS> that's by far the biggest one , <EOS> and then teletext , is still here , <EOS> that's like fourteen , <EOS> and volume selection . <EOS>
he looks like a bong . <EOS> like a what ? <EOS> okay . <EOS> sorry . <EOS> no . <EOS> quite squarey . <EOS> scary ? <EOS> i dunno it it looks more like a donkey in fact i would say . <EOS> okay so i hope that it helps you uh in the process of designing a remote control . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> sorry . <EOS> thank you . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> there we go . warning , finish meeting now . <EOS> so . <EOS> i rounded it up far too fast . <EOS> um . <EOS> where are we going ? <EOS> my documents , that's not what i want . <EOS> my project documents . <EOS> there we go . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> its own button on the front . <EOS> mm . <EOS> okay , one nice big button . <EOS> old fashioned button , to satisfy the grandmothers . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> okay . <EOS> mm . <EOS> s <EOS> uh um , you know , some func some features on the control to display a time , or t to display <EOS>
in the entire mankind . <EOS> okay , <EOS> you're very enthusiastic about your own design , <EOS> huh ? <EOS> also if you're sixty years old <EOS> you don't have all the other options uh always uh on your screen . <EOS> so it's t i think it's really easy to use . <EOS> you want these options to <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> spongy . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> something . <EOS> i don't think it's rubber . <EOS> no . <EOS> n n n <EOS> so we need a spongy feeling . <EOS> uh did you have something about uh <EOS> are you going to invite sponge bob , maybe he can <EOS>
no no , the upper one is the bomb . <EOS> yes . <EOS> wrong . <EOS> shit . <EOS> i knew it . <EOS> i knew it . <EOS> four in a row . <EOS> no . that's too much work . <EOS> uh . <EOS> come on . <EOS>
uh i mean how long does i how how how long can it be held off a station ? <EOS> how long the <EOS> how long the bit the batteries long . <EOS> ah . <EOS> ah . <EOS> a long time . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> a long <EOS> no no no , <EOS> it can <EOS> it should be weeks . <EOS>
it's a donkey . <EOS> i don't know , <EOS> what time did we start this meeting , <EOS> i'm not sure . <EOS> uh i think it was uh <EOS> half past . <EOS> half past ten . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> brilliant . <EOS> okay , <EOS> perfect . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> okay . <EOS> which is the same area . <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> could you re could you redesign your board ? <EOS> five to ten . <EOS> well that <EOS> oh , five five centimetres by ten centimetres . <EOS> yeah , right . <EOS> yeah , i think it's feasib <EOS> well one um um <EOS> how could we do it ? <EOS> we could put the board next to , well , under the l_c_d_ <EOS> and for example make the l_c_d_ be totally unrelated to the thing that you hold in your hand . <EOS> like holding something , and the l_c_d_ to be just on top of it , you know somehow . <EOS> well but maybe let's stick to the s spongy thing , like one unit . <EOS> well fi five to ten it would be feasible . <EOS>
we c <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah <EOS> and <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah but then again <EOS> i i think it is <EOS> because if you think about it , the watch , although it's only a tiny amount it's it's um it's always moving for the whole day <EOS> and they don't run out over night when you leave them on the side . <EOS> and th for the same the same reason , you're only using it for a v incredibly short amount of time just to send the signal and then you're finished with it <EOS> and you put it <EOS> no no i do i don't think the the draw on it would be <EOS>
so yeah , <EOS> you know what you have to do . <EOS> this is uh this is it . <EOS> you get your meal and everything , <EOS> so <EOS> trendwatching . <EOS> okay . that's fine . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yo . <EOS> so , <EOS> we're finished for t for this time . <EOS> we're going to have some lunch . <EOS>
i think it would be difficult technologically , <EOS> because if your if your remote's lost it's probably under the settee <EOS> and in that case you can't you can't send an infrared sing signal to it to find it , <EOS> s so it's <EOS> i think <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm . <EOS>
no <EOS> i have it . <EOS> i just draw too quick i think . <EOS> okay , <EOS> that's it . <EOS> more . <EOS> no , <EOS> that's okay , <EOS> thank you . <EOS> it's just to get used to it . <EOS> okay . <EOS> i thought these pens would be just um uh you write it down and you download it to word , <EOS> you already did it or no ? <EOS> no , not yet , okay . <EOS> but it's just <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> ah , it's designed for a cof okay . <EOS> is it design for a coffee machine ? <EOS> well that's its current application , <EOS> i would presume that it's kind of , they wouldn't design it to handle a hundred things th so . <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> maybe you could ask your the <EOS> you could ask the engineering department if we can <EOS>
yeah , same here . <EOS> oh . <EOS> sorry . <EOS> uh let's see . <EOS> which one was mine ? <EOS> so <EOS> let's have a look , <EOS> we have forty minutes , <EOS> so it's it's more than enough . <EOS> okay , perfect . <EOS> so <EOS> we have <EOS> oh no , <EOS> what's that ? <EOS> so so <EOS> we have uh forty minutes for this uh for this second meeting , <EOS> and we have to make uh sure that we going t that we are sure , that we are , <EOS>
to keep the remote ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> case . <EOS> a case holder . a holder remote holder . <EOS> yeah , holder . <EOS> holder , yeah , mm-hmm . <EOS> and francine ? <EOS> participant two . <EOS> you are number two ? <EOS> yes . <EOS> no no , i'm three . <EOS>
okay . yeah . <EOS> uh <EOS> 'kay . as far as the uh technology it its' got the latest trends in speech technology , <EOS> but it's missing the screen , as we said , <EOS> um but it does have the push-buttons , or the scroll-buttons , <EOS> um but it doesn't have that fancy solar power or the the vibrating energy mechanism . <EOS> so i give it a a four . <EOS> i'd give it a kinda middle of the road for <EOS>
alright . <EOS> um , not sure if you had a a look at the other um control in that example . <EOS> um it's a very simple one . <EOS> it's got only the basic functions mm <EOS> but um it's the same size as the the hard to use one . <EOS> uh it looked a bit clunky . <EOS> they're very big and not very much use for buttons . <EOS> um , <EOS> and it's just very hard to access the advanced functions . <EOS> there's there's nothing for instance for a slow motion button . <EOS>
not really . <EOS> well , <EOS> nice animals , <EOS> nice words . <EOS> sounds good . <EOS> um back to business , back to the money part . <EOS> um from the finance department i have learned that we are aiming for a selling price of twenty five euros . <EOS> and we're hoping for a aim of fifty million euros <EOS> and uh we are hoping to achieve that uh by aiming for an international market . <EOS> and the production cost will be twelve euro fifty max . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> 'cause we have got room , we've got some budget there to add a few things to it , <EOS> that's right . <EOS> mm . <EOS> but as it is now , i w would say mm , six , something . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS>
no , <EOS> just the remote . <EOS> a television don't have to be on , <EOS> that one you can press on , <EOS> yeah stand-by , <EOS> then press on remote , <EOS> press on <EOS> and then t_v_ should be available . or not . <EOS> but <EOS>
s i've got a lot of paperwork to catch up on <EOS> so let's close this and come back and 'kay . <EOS> yeah , i've got a lot of paperwork to catch up on too . <EOS> oh . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> you know focus on where the idea will be taken up , first it's most likely to be taken up first of all where the main purchasing power is coming from for a product like this . <EOS> okay , so the remote control functions . <EOS> um we've got the t_v_ , <EOS> we've got the video , <EOS> now there's um
yeah . <EOS> i can <EOS> um . <EOS> one month for the standard one with button . <EOS> even if we have a l_c_d_ display ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah even . <EOS> i mean that this is really standard devices now . <EOS> um eight . <EOS> for uh speech recognition . <EOS>
yeah , <EOS> i think that will be our best bet . <EOS> normal scroll wheel . <EOS> and i think we should lose the curve . <EOS> i think we should scrap the sample speaker . <EOS> it's four pri it four units . <EOS> lose <EOS> yeah , <EOS> but if you would i <EOS> it is a new feature , <EOS> it it's something special . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm , mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm , mm-hmm . <EOS> whilst you know , some people might get annoyed if we uh if we just dump it , <EOS> i <EOS> there's something that i unclear really understanding . <EOS> is this a technology that recognize keywords speech keywords ? <EOS>
but uh usually , whe when new assistants come , they would like to share the room with someone that knows uh l uh it's related with the project , <EOS> so he can <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> no , <EOS> that's that's proximity doesn't play a big role there . <EOS> we can discuss with people that <EOS> the the space is very small , <EOS> i mean , altogether it's <EOS>
aspect . <EOS> sorry ? <EOS> what does the management say ? <EOS> i think we will have um much bigger project next time and a much bigger salary as well . <EOS> ah . <EOS> all it depends on who watch this meeting . <EOS> we don't know . <EOS>
yeah <EOS> we'll discuss a f a fly or do we'll do another meeting abo on elephants . <EOS> thanks . <EOS> so <EOS> so another important part of the project is about money , <EOS> uh and about <EOS> so about finances . <EOS> so we should target selling price of twenty-five euro for this remote control <EOS> and uh we have um <EOS> which which would generate a profit of of um fifty million euros , okay . <EOS> and we should target the inter an international market . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> well <EOS> if we're gonna say that function um fashion we put the fashion in in electronics then you automatically , i think , a sort of younger group that that's who's gonna be attracted to this . <EOS> yes , <EOS> i do think , who's gonna have the money to buy that also , that one ? <EOS>
okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah <EOS> but we we don't we're not aiming a command for that . <EOS> that's the thing . <EOS> and all of those require the other commands with more complexity and more software and <EOS> i think a lot of that's proprietary anyways . <EOS> you're not gonna be able to , you , like command a tivo with our remote . i don't think . <EOS>
no . <EOS> . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> well <EOS> that's right , <EOS> i mean <EOS> th this this slide here i mean the satisfaction with uh room for creativity , <EOS> i mean <EOS> i think we've allowed ourselves uh as much creativity as the uh the the the product uh allows . <EOS> um i won't comment on leadership , <EOS> uh teamwork i think we've uh i think everybody's uh worked pretty well together . <EOS> um we've just about coped with the whiteboard and digital pens , <EOS> uh i think the results speak for itself <EOS> and new ideas found , um , again gi no given relatively everyday product , i think we've v very uh very effectively come up with a a new uh <EOS>
okay , okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> mm . <EOS> it's okay ? <EOS> regarding the first line , what so we're just expecting no more use of the teletext . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> and that's it . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> but i dunno , but why , <EOS> nobody's a threat to me . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i've , haven't i've never seen a locking functionality . <EOS> i dunno , <EOS> what uh do you guys have a a yea or nay on that a feeling about whether that's really necessary ? <EOS> um <EOS> i would say it's if it's simple to do , <EOS>
um right so <EOS> for now just for th the white board um basically uh just to get used to it , <EOS> i haven't tried it yet either <EOS> um i'm just gonna start <EOS> and um mm carry like five remotes around <EOS> um and just write down i'm just gonna write down one of the names of my um desert discs <EOS> you know <EOS> if you if you were trapped on a desert island and you could only bring five c_d_s along with you name one of them that you could , not all five , <EOS> if you wanna write all five go for it <EOS> but name one of them that you could um . <EOS> oh , <EOS> we skipped introductions . <EOS> nice . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> so <EOS> the components i quickly draw here , <EOS> is that <EOS> in this part you have the remote control the the sender and on the other part the receiver <EOS> so that's <EOS> my method is um will be to <EOS> well <EOS> my aim would be to uh design the and choose the chips and the infrared um components to build the remote control <EOS> right . <EOS>
could can i ask where these figures come from , <EOS> is this market research we've <EOS> um it was market research <EOS> and there were a hundred people in the room , <EOS> so eighty out of a hundred said they would spend more money . <EOS> now <EOS> in between , as the project manager , they sent me an email from the powers that be <EOS> um that teletext is outdated um <EOS> and the internet is coming in as important , <EOS> but that they want this remote control to only be for t_v_ <EOS> um with incorporating the corporate image , colour and slogan . <EOS>
um i hate when there's like four different buttons and you have to press to actually turn on the t_v_ <EOS> like you have to do one for the power of the t_v_ <EOS> and then like another one to get the actual screen on <EOS> and something else to get it all going , i don't know . <EOS> now they keep combining all different remotes together , <EOS> and i don't know if i necessarily like that <EOS> 'cause i feel like you end up with multimedia overload . <EOS> i just wanna watch the t_v_ um . <EOS>
can i see ? <EOS> thanks . <EOS> okay <EOS> i like the volume control , that's good . <EOS> th this is a magic one <EOS> but i know we don't want to talk about that , <EOS> you know like <EOS> uh i i i it is a very futuristic , <EOS> it's like uh it's like a brain machine interface and all this stuff we are thinking about in the future , it can come . <EOS> so that uh then what we look t <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> so see you in thirty minutes . <EOS> yep . <EOS>
um we're gonna discuss the evaluation criteria , <EOS> and that's with courtney . <EOS> okay , <EOS> it's a powerpoint presentation . <EOS> i don't really know exactly what we should uh talk about . <EOS> it's under evaluation . <EOS> right . <EOS> alright . <EOS> um so these are the criteria we're gonna ask , <EOS> is it easy to use , is it fashionable uh <EOS> yeah , i guess we should write these down so we can reference them . <EOS>
yeah , i think so , yeah . <EOS> yes . <EOS> but you should make sure that you have every button they need on it . <EOS> because uh things for uh teletext , i dunno uh , w <EOS> what's the name ? <EOS> mm-hmm , of course . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> uh so that you know , it's flying off in all directions , <EOS> so that uh um uh <EOS> again the n need to look at the the the technicalities of um <EOS> mm . <EOS> actually achieving that in terms of whether the , you know , the power requirements of the uh such a source , um you know , compromise the our our need for uh you know , it it being um mm permanently uh you know , available . <EOS> uh whether whether different technology um <EOS> i mean th all all these remotes are presumably infrared , <EOS> and like they have been for a long time . <EOS> uh we we possibly need to be looking at at at something different , um you know , short range , not like the old uh radio remote controls <EOS> where you'd change next door's telly when you change yours . um <EOS>
actually , <EOS> does tha does special material mean that plastic is not a special material ? <EOS> 'cause i think they can be plastic . <EOS> 'cause the rate we're going we can put the rubber on top . <EOS> yeah . they could be plastic , <EOS> we don't have to have rubber buttons , <EOS> because we haven't got a double curved case . <EOS>
no problem . no problem . <EOS> mm . it was four months ? <EOS> sure . <EOS> oh right . <EOS> nice , okay . <EOS> well . <EOS> the hell . <EOS> to make it a little bit easier . <EOS> it's a giraffe . <EOS> make that cute . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> to find it . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> to find it . <EOS> um and um <EOS> lot of the time they it takes too much time to learn how to use a new remote control . <EOS> so they want something s really very simple and uh easy to use . <EOS>
f_ f_ five . <EOS> okay . yeah . yep . <EOS> f_ five . yeah . <EOS> uh-huh hmm okay . <EOS> mm-hmm . mm . first of all , they find it very ugly . <EOS> current remote controls as you know they're the same as this one <EOS> uh they're not nice colour , not nice shape , <EOS> i mean they're all the same , <EOS> and they're not l good looking . <EOS> um what is interesting <EOS> is that in fact it seems that they were people are ready to pay for nice and look and fancy looking uh remote control , <EOS> so i think we should probably spend lots of time in and effort in that um . <EOS> and the other thing is that uh the the current remote controls are not so easy to use <EOS> and it it the the current uh facilities that they offer do not match what people really want to use their remote controls . <EOS> for instance uh we see that uh they zap very often <EOS> so i think this is a very uh important uh functionality <EOS> that it should be easy for them to to zap uh in one way or another . <EOS> and most of the buttons uh on uh current remote controls are not used , <EOS> so i think we should design something where some of the buttons which are those that are used should be easier to see and use than others that only a couple of people are using . <EOS>
and also fo you know for mood lighting and and stuff , <EOS> that would be rather cool . <EOS> i think that's actually something that should be in version two , is the ability to you know to control things other than the t_v_ <EOS> and not just electronic equipment but you know the whole environment of the room . <EOS>
nah . <EOS> well <EOS> you can um have uh the basic things on the same place , like on off button on top and the t_v_ channels one two three four as a block , and then the volume uh obviously on t on top , so you can see . <EOS> but the rest is uh you don't use that often , <EOS> so if you have a clear button with an good icon on it , it should be clear as well . <EOS> so it doesn't matter what place it is on the remote control i think , <EOS> so you can do something unique with that . <EOS>
it's dark in the room . <EOS> no . <EOS> it's just batteries , <EOS> that's cheaper . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> and and we can use the home station kind of thing . <EOS> um cases , <EOS> flat , so uncurved . <EOS> uh two d_ curved is um like front to the back . <EOS> and three d_ curved is also in depth . <EOS>
yes . <EOS> mm . <EOS> well , i think i think that that's something that we'll have to discuss um with the user interface person <EOS> because i think there's a lot of argument to be made for one button for one feature . <EOS> because i think one of the things were complaining about in my what i found out in my research is when they complained about how hard it is to learn a new one . <EOS> the changing modes was something <EOS> i mean you and i , all f all four of us we work with computers all the time , <EOS> changing modes is nothing for us , <EOS> but people who <EOS>
okay . okay . <EOS> so anyway if <EOS> well we just <EOS> we need to <EOS> okay so if we're not gonna have a screen i think <EOS> i was thinking okay . <EOS> so basically it's just gonna be a wheel then ? <EOS> and you're just gonna <EOS> i mean i think you're gonna have to have some kind of a <EOS> right . <EOS> yeah <EOS> like you're g <EOS> yeah <EOS> like you're gonna have to be able to switch to like a mode where you can <EOS> okay we're not choosing that , i guess . <EOS> but like choose channel control , <EOS> like if you wa <EOS> because people aren't gonna be able to have like , um , you know , channels one two three four five six seven eight nine . <EOS> so that <EOS> people seems to be well <EOS>
no , <EOS> no screens , it's too complex . <EOS> okay . <EOS> too expensive for twelve euro ? <EOS> mm . too expensive , yeah . <EOS> and n maybe not too expensive , <EOS> well it's not my problem , <EOS> but well okay . <EOS> but no screens on remote controls . <EOS>
oh . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> it's a they all have their own office . <EOS> i mean in in the in the law faculty they're at best there half time . <EOS> okay . <EOS> no no , that's it . <EOS> as we said , it's it's really a matter of personal preference , <EOS> it cannot be something else . <EOS> it cannot be imposed for sure . <EOS> it's uh <EOS>
uh . <EOS> . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> okay , just hang on a second everybody . <EOS> i haven't actually looked at this yet . <EOS> ah . <EOS> um <EOS> very nice . <EOS> i haven't looked at it , <EOS> but let's just start it off and we'll see what happens . <EOS> if you're all ready . <EOS>
alright , okay . <EOS> so we are <EOS> we'll discuss it <EOS> we will get some information in the next meeting , <EOS> so for now we get uh the funct this is the functional designer ? <EOS> that's the first aspect . <EOS> right . <EOS> and uh discuss it in the next meeting . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> um reissa . let's plug you in , baby . <EOS> where does it go into ? <EOS> . <EOS> here ? <EOS> the blue thing . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> uh , yeah , this is getting all . <EOS> mm . <EOS> . <EOS> yeah , then you just have to do function f_ eight and it should come up . <EOS>
just example colour , <EOS> so uh <EOS> there's one of the colours we would like to uh see in our prototype . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> it's a fresh colour . <EOS> and uh the screen light blue . <EOS> oh uh <EOS> this the scroll button and the microphone on the on the sides here under . <EOS> and the r_ and r_ logo , <EOS> it just says r_ and r_ now , <EOS> but uh <EOS>
i'm gonna write that down . <EOS> so , what are you saying , maybe we should market it in different colours for different <EOS> so we could do like the pink range , the blue range , the green range , the <EOS> yeah . <EOS> that's yeah . <EOS>
evaluation . <EOS> okay . <EOS> sure . <EOS> um , alright so the way this works , i'm gonna need to plug into powerpoint , <EOS> i'll try and do it as quick as possible . <EOS> um , this is um <EOS> i'll just go over your head <EOS> if that's okay . <EOS>
save it , okay . <EOS> i've done it . <EOS> new ? <EOS> 'kay . <EOS> you have to draw uh push hard on the pen <EOS> or uh <EOS> mm uh not really . <EOS> kind of firm touch . <EOS> that one . <EOS> oh . uh hmm . <EOS>
it might also sort of annoy people if we get used to having the buttons in one shape . <EOS> yeah that's true . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> and it would probably cost more to produce , 'cause they're irregular . <EOS> yeah that's true . <EOS> mm . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> and um just go creative . <EOS> maybe the kinetic mo provision of energy then . <EOS> it's been done for watches , but i haven't seen that for remotes , yet . <EOS> okay . yeah , this that's that's very good . <EOS> and then you can market it . <EOS> never have to change a battery again . <EOS>
if you have them on uh i can uh <EOS> yeah . yeah , i can find uh . <EOS> okay . <EOS> oh , <EOS> in case you want it this is a dead kind of fly . between the the the , yeah , the the uh <EOS> screen ? <EOS> okay . <EOS>
um mm there's the l_c_d_ screen , <EOS> um which maybe maybe is too expensive , <EOS> um but i think also at the scroll wheel , i haven't mentioned it here , <EOS> the scroll wheel could be used without an l_c_d_ screen , just for changing channel numbers easily . <EOS> i think even that , <EOS> i mean , that would be a fairly cheap thing , compared to an l_c_d_ screen , to implement , <EOS> um but i think that would be quite useful as well . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> uh-huh , yeah . <EOS> hard but <EOS> yeah . <EOS> you can break it . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> remote control is hard to lose . <EOS> hard to lose , <EOS> yeah it sh and it's easy to find . <EOS> y yeah , <EOS> you could you could call it . <EOS>
i think we have to come to a decision now , <EOS> just i i think we we what we just do i is vote mm . <EOS> about the uh the l_c_d_ uh display so <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> you assume , you want a democratic voyt vote , <EOS> right ? <EOS> okay . <EOS>
yeah , even harder to draw like this than black board style . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> and it's far too slow this way . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> you cou you could draw on it , but not as main function . <EOS> no . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> you could do like the computers where they have like the grapefruit , apple machine and they have like the blueberry , like all the colours are named after fruits . <EOS> yeah , yeah , yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
of course , they do . <EOS> one hundred per cent , that's your first thing , you go , oh i'm not gonna buy that , 'cause i dunno if it works or not . <EOS> well , they do , but it's like it's not <EOS> yeah , but it looks good . <EOS> if it looks good and it's it can just be there for decoration . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> we've used the whiteboard . <EOS> super super . <EOS> i had some problem with the pen i think , <EOS> but minus your p <EOS> minus your powerpoint fiasco . <EOS> well that's not my fault . <EOS> that's obviously the people i work for uh that work for me , <EOS> uh they've just you know <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i'm i'm with uh raj on that , <EOS> i think , you know , <EOS> i've got i've got no i've got a north facing house , there's not really ever sun coming in my window . <EOS> okay , so probably just <EOS>
so what are our findings ? <EOS> in our <EOS> uh in our findings we have seen that <EOS> when we did our remote control market survey we found that uh people l uh people do have preference for tho fancy mobi uh f remote controls which look and feel very good , <EOS> rather than having a functional look and feel uh good . <EOS> so this sh this clearly indicates their preference for the design their outlook of the remote controls . <EOS> so we should take into uh <EOS> we should consider this factor as the most important factor , <EOS> because this factor is twice as important , <EOS> the second factor which is further ti twice the as important as the sec as uh the third factor . <EOS> so this factor becomes the most important factor in our surv uh uh in our mark uh means in take in designing our rem uh remote controls . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> although of course i mean at twenty five euros , i don't think we're looking at charging the earth for the uh device . <EOS> think that's well within the normal bracket . <EOS> um your idea of the u_s_b_ would i think would largely depend on the cost . <EOS> u_s_b_'s definitely one of the cheapest interfaces out there , <EOS> but it might push the cost of the overall unit up <EOS> 'cause it would require not just the connection but the chip for communicating with the rest of the system . <EOS> that one might have to be based on <EOS>
so . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> so everybody is okay with the new requirements ? <EOS> so i i so <EOS> as as for the colour , what what do you think ? <EOS> i think it has to be yellow . <EOS> yellow ? <EOS> do you think that people like the colour yellow ? <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> i was thinking about that . <EOS> then your lights would go off , though . <EOS> mm . <EOS> so we everyth <EOS> our our competition out there has got these these multiple adaptors where they can use 'em for their v_c_r_s , their d_v_d_s , their their televisions <EOS> and we're coming out with one remote for television only . <EOS> and so to me we have to make this a really special product <EOS> i i i don't s i really have to say i don't see the market niche for this product . <EOS> at this price i don't see it yet . <EOS> i'm i i go along with this , <EOS> because this is what we're given to try to market , <EOS> but i i don't see the market niche for this product
mm . <EOS> but um that may or may not be a good thing . <EOS> sorry . <EOS> um but it could have an l_c_d_ screen <EOS> and it could have multiple scroll buttons , <EOS> and it could have the the company's new development of the um sample sensor and speaker . <EOS>
i think the project manager would be interested to look about the financial issues in making these models . <EOS> project evaluation project satisfaction , for example . <EOS> i don't know , we have to ask these question . <EOS> we have to give answers so <EOS> i suppose that you this criteria , is it ? <EOS>
right . <EOS> i think we'll need a we'll need a mode switch , <EOS> but then if we have a mode switch we're gonna need some kinda indicator <EOS> yeah yeah the mode switch . <EOS> just the lights behind the buttons . <EOS> you could have back-lit buttons maybe . <EOS>
and you have the pretty little shell going on . <EOS> some little eyes . happy . <EOS> there you go . <EOS> that's a turtle . <EOS> yes . <EOS> so what are your favourite characteristics ? <EOS> um . i i like the whole having a shell thing . <EOS> it's quite cool carry your home around where you go , <EOS> um quite decorative little animals , <EOS> they can swim , <EOS> they can , <EOS> they're very adaptable , <EOS> they carry everything they need with them , <EOS> um and they're easy to draw . <EOS>
well , um <EOS> i would say that the most you could probably hope for is gaining a year's lead on most people anyway . <EOS> you always have to bring out new designs , <EOS> so if we can get next year then that's possibly a good place to start anyway . um . <EOS>
am i <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> i mean , <EOS> it would t totally take care of our problem of not wanting to change batteries . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , um i think it's good , <EOS> as as long as we consider the the cost and the uh how reliable it is , <EOS> but as far as i know , the technology is good . <EOS>
again it de <EOS> mm . <EOS> w m yeah <EOS> so the <EOS> a remote control , like , <EOS> so we have to s look at the life also . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah <EOS> the the s if you <EOS> if you had something du uh using the standard batteries and the solar charging , <EOS> um , i don't think you'd <EOS> i think the <EOS> it would d well you know how long the standard double a_s would last in or triple a_s would last . <EOS>
and hold it so <EOS> wh what's the marketing perspective ? <EOS> yeah i think it's good . <EOS> good good good job . <EOS> mm pedro can demonstrate the the paging ability . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so you ha you have like the the base station with um the little button for the where's my remote . <EOS>
yeah , that's right . <EOS> so <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> well i i think that norman and i would think about um the technical points <EOS> and um we should discuss it in the next meeting , or <EOS> need to collect information . <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
yes . <EOS> so we're have to design something that is very user friendly . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> something uh visual that has something that will will draw people to buy the product , <EOS> because i think everybody's experienced with uh remote controls , <EOS> and some remote controls are are worth uh throwing out the window . <EOS>
is <EOS> you can easily find the button in the dark or so ? <EOS> but <EOS> but in th in the dark uh <EOS> yeah but is going to be always turned on , the light ? <EOS> it will be turned on when the when the user move the remote control i think , <EOS> no ? <EOS>
i have uh i've no idea <EOS> i mean i should know a bit more about how fast we can uh design it . <EOS> i don't think <EOS> uh yeah . <EOS> yeah . okay finish tonight . <EOS> but basically yeah maybe i can continue with my presentation , it would be al you you <EOS> but i think we have some technical problem or so . <EOS> so i'm just going to describe briefly what we do in the remote control . <EOS> if fact <EOS>
yeah . well uh <EOS> s <EOS> function of remote control is just just <EOS> you know , <EOS> change channels is its main function . <EOS> so <EOS> we want it to be um a t_v_ remote or <EOS> i i mean do we want it to to do other things besides just be a a television remote ? <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm . <EOS> it does it does seem as if we're just to do something really simple and mass-produced , <EOS> the <EOS> which is pretty much the same as these existing models , <EOS> just maybe mm-hmm . <EOS> inspired ? <EOS> a little bit more inspired ,
right . <EOS> um <EOS> okay so just <EOS> could you just list all the things that it does s so i can write them in the report . <EOS> but um <EOS> this button um , because it's red it's sort of very prominent , we're gonna use it as uh it can be the power button <EOS> if you hold it for maybe two seconds it'll send a stand-by signal . <EOS> um apart from that it's gonna be used as a confirm button for the l_c_d_ screen <EOS> and you use this as a jog-dial . <EOS>
hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm . um . <EOS> but i think a lot of um like cable and sky and stuff , that would be tuned to one channel , <EOS> and then you'd have another remote for all of those channels . <EOS> like to get to fifty five and the higher numbers <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> we were we were thinking that <EOS> normally we'd go for fruity colours , <EOS> but maybe we're also thinking that your sort of middle aged man , for an example customer , might not want a fruity coloured remote , <EOS> so m maybe we'd have one version that's a bit toned down , <EOS> maybe with with less contrasts on it . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> something still a little bright to make it hard to lose , but <EOS>
yeah okay . <EOS> that's that's good , <EOS> but <EOS> and uh if you don't light 'em up , they don't uh you don't see 'em very good . <EOS> i think it's modern to light this area up , and to light this area up . <EOS> so the focus gets on these parts and not on there . <EOS>
ju just a simple log-in , something like that . <EOS> well , <EOS> y you s you see the fi uh <EOS> thing is when you buy a remote , you you set the uh channels , <EOS> the the channels are different on each te television , <EOS> they aren't set in a preset order , <EOS> so uh <EOS> if you uh lock on a remote , uh let's say channel fifteen , well channel fifteen on this television is different than channel fifteen on the other television , <EOS> so that would be uh that would be actually the main concern . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> okay , just easy to use is very cool , <EOS> so just give it a two . <EOS> maybe three then . <EOS> learnable's <EOS> no , but definitely better , much better than uh than uh than avera average , yeah . <EOS> mm uh . <EOS> the normal . <EOS> and the one you showed is just all buttons and you don't know <EOS>
oh right okay . <EOS> i cover myself up . <EOS> i feel like madonna with one of these on . <EOS> i said i feel like madonna with one of these on . <EOS> . <EOS> i've always wanted one of these , i really have . <EOS> where do you buy 'em from ? <EOS> they're . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> and uh what abo uh <EOS> christine , what about your uh the industrial design plan ? <EOS> are you have a design already on this product or uh you're still working on the design ? <EOS> um no , i i have not begun working on the design , <EOS> and um i uh <EOS> i actually didn't know we were designing a remote control , <EOS> i thought we were designing a new monitor . <EOS> um the website i went to look at had some announcements about an introduction of a um uh some sort of a seven inch um monitor , <EOS> and um i understood that that was the project goal . <EOS>
but i don't i don't think it means the room as in this room . <EOS> i think it means like you know <EOS> oh , <EOS> oh right right , oh right okay room for creativ <EOS> oh right i just looked up and saw okay whiteboard , digital pens , the room . <EOS> no , of course , yeah . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> and that titanium the new silver sleek ones that's last couple of years , very much so . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> curves . <EOS> mm . <EOS> right so um <EOS> let's go ahead and wrap that up here for now , <EOS> i'm gonna put these initial ideas that we've got in the um project documents , <EOS> so if you guys wa need a reminder about what we've talked about um the different you know kind of trade-offs that we've got and the other ideas , you can consult them at your leisure . <EOS>
interesting question . <EOS> 's a bit of a challenge question . <EOS> mm . <EOS> well <EOS> i'd say shop around <EOS> but with our time constraints , is that really a feasible option ? <EOS> yes . <EOS> mm . <EOS> right , that's my concern too . <EOS> um , if we do go the lithium battery route then we'll have to go outside our current manufacturer . <EOS> my personal preference is <EOS> i'll just throw my cards on the table , <EOS> uh i think we should probably go the solar battery route , <EOS> just to kinda keep with the environmentally friendly theme that we have going on . <EOS> uh , i like the idea of the visible light signalling , <EOS> that's something to set us apart <EOS> and uh i was thinking about i was thinking of ways that we could produce the remote in a variety of different case materials to suit different tastes . <EOS> so we're not so confined by one style <EOS> and say some you know , say our the one <EOS> if we just go with one and it doesn't go over well then we're in a bad situation . <EOS>
it's a touchscreen . <EOS> so um yeah <EOS> you got a general f uh f the functions of the device uh for a d_v_d_ player or uh so um the pl yeah um f for uh playing uh reverse uh . <EOS> and um you got here uh real buttons for uh selecting uh a device . <EOS> so um <EOS> this button is for a d_v_d_ <EOS> or <EOS> so um <EOS> for every um device you've got a uh a f a b a part uh display of a part buttons . <EOS> so uh <EOS> you you never got uh all the buttons uh on w one device . <EOS> so uh <EOS> that's uh my uh idea about it . <EOS> um yeah and <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> the price should be below twelve and a half euro . <EOS> well that's so <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah <EOS> but as the marketing manager says , people is willing to people are willing to pay more for good design . <EOS> yeah people are willing to pay more , <EOS> but the company is not willing to invest more at the moment . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah , i think it's an added value to the remote control <EOS> and maybe it can attract all the ecological k yeah consumers <EOS> and <EOS> but about the the price of adding this solar battery , would it be something really that will increase the price of production more , <EOS> no ? <EOS>
cost . mm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> 'kay . <EOS> mm . <EOS> t_ not t_v_ to say , <EOS> but if you can control almost all of the functionality from the display , i don't know how much power an l_c_d_ would take , <EOS> but it might be quite low ? <EOS>
what's your experience with remote control ? <EOS> a lot of buttons . <EOS> and you always lose them . <EOS> a lot of buttons which you don't use <EOS> or who you don't use <EOS> complex . <EOS> i always lose them . <EOS> yes . <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
three , i will say three . <EOS> three ? <EOS> okay . <EOS> 'kay . <EOS> three . <EOS> isn't it bitter like that ? <EOS> yeah yeah yeah . <EOS> then uh let me <EOS> what other <EOS> the other criterion is is it technologically uh technologically in innovative . <EOS>
yeah but i'm a bit worried about the budget . <EOS> so <EOS> uh this is <EOS> basis station is nothing more , just it's a wire which is coming from the main cable and uh you're having one socket on which the thing sits . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> although you do need to include r_f_ kind of circuitry in the remote . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> well that's true , yeah , <EOS> you could get fifty by five and a zero or whatever , <EOS> that that makes sense . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> 'cause that facilitates having all the numbers you could ever need . <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
digital . <EOS> ah , okay . <EOS> f f f for di for digital or um or for or for cable , whatever , <EOS> you're basically looking at four or five terrestrial channels , and then um your v_c_ uh and then the channel through your v_c_r_ and or d_v_d_ player . and or um box . <EOS> so it's not <EOS> i'm not really excessively concerned about that . <EOS> you must have two two modes , <EOS> basic mode , where um the joystick's uh left right left right for channels , up down for volume , <EOS> um and the uh uh and the menu mode for uh further functions . <EOS> um now the reason i was particularly interested in using rubber for this is that if we're going to have a highly ergonomic design , um it needs to be ergonomic for left or right handed people . <EOS> um , so you <EOS>
a two . <EOS> a two . <EOS> two , yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> huh ? <EOS> and most all because of the option to <EOS> whoa . <EOS> ooh . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> it's okay . <EOS> that happens above also . <EOS> but maybe when you scroll away and back it will be normal , <EOS> but <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> sounds reasonable . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . so <EOS> so i guess it'd be something we could like attach to the <EOS> or like the same technology could be put inside the well if you're trying to avoid having a second product 'cause obviously you could have a second product that gave you the right pitch which would set the remote off to say here i am sort of thing , you know without sound recognition . <EOS> but if you <EOS>
okay , i don't think we need to screw it in . <EOS> just push it . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> we had that um to dis-include teletext um because it's become outdated , and everybody uses the internet anyway . <EOS> um , dunno what oracle would have to say with that but never mind . <EOS> um it's only for the television , <EOS> which i'm presuming means it's for a specific television , <EOS> and um instead of colours and sorta colour options , they want corporate colour and slogan somehow implemented in the new design . <EOS>
mm 'kay <EOS> . okay <EOS> now what i see with the scroll wheel is everybody has buttons . <EOS> so from a marketing standpoint i have i have another door to walk through when we have something that's unique . <EOS> if it creates something more complex or more expensive , then i don't know if that makes it uh a marketing necessity . <EOS> but again , from a marketing perspective i want as much new and different about this thing as possible <EOS> because we're we're co it's a very competitive market . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah i think <EOS> i mean if <EOS> yeah it is it is qui it's quite a cool feature to have <EOS> and also if they've got it if they've got these parts already in stock , then it won't be cheap to re-manufacture them , <EOS> uh or it will be cheap sorry to re-manufacture them . <EOS> so do you reckon that's a good idea that , where's the remote , i'm here thing ? <EOS> i think that would be quite fun . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> as wide as possible . <EOS> like this or like this . <EOS> mm yeah . <EOS> not like my my mum who points it at the ceiling and wonders why the th th the television doesn't work . <EOS> um yeah , i mean <EOS> i d i th <EOS> i sorta envisaged that if if this was the the thing , then sort of the the whole of the top would be the uh the infrared uh . <EOS>
'kay , what else ? <EOS> so , <EOS> no speech recognition ? <EOS> or <EOS> well , <EOS> if it could be done , we <EOS> yeah , <EOS> we have to keep yeah . <EOS> y <EOS> it should be done . if it could be done , should be done . <EOS>
to go fa to go faster . <EOS> mm . <EOS> mm . it's an interesting idea , that if you press it for a long time it does something else , in general . <EOS> so if you you have your ten buttons for the for the numeric the numerical buttons <EOS> and you have instead of having just one memory <EOS>
. <EOS>
okay . <EOS> twelve , nearly thirteen , <EOS> yeah . the cost <EOS> what the cost is ? <EOS> twelve , twelve a half . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> i think for the cost we want for the cost we want it's better to have uh uh <EOS> let's see . yeah . <EOS> you can move to the next slide , so . <EOS> so the di the differen the findings <EOS> you know <EOS> what you find inside the re i the the system here inside it is just , you know a bulb and an infrared bulb , <EOS> so here for example the infrared bulb will be here <EOS> and the bulb it will be somewhere inside . <EOS>
one uh most to the right . <EOS> yes that one . <EOS> yes . <EOS> uh p <EOS> this one ? <EOS> press f_ eleven . <EOS> ah <EOS> cool . <EOS> okay . so <EOS> that's my name , . <EOS> uh we're going to make uh a remote control , <EOS> you already know that . <EOS> just have a look , <EOS> are we going to uh this agenda of our meeting . <EOS> you know , this is about twenty five minutes , this meeting . <EOS>
even design . <EOS> you can paint it afterward . <EOS> no problem . <EOS> we have a very large department of paint . <EOS> you will do it . <EOS> okay , okay . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> do don't worry , <EOS> you you you speak with mm mm . <EOS>
'kay . <EOS> and apparently , the fashion trends are that people want sort of clothes and shoes and things with a fruit and vegetables theme . <EOS> um but um the feel of the material should be spongy , <EOS> which is contrary to last year , apparently . <EOS> i presume it must have been not not spongy last year . <EOS>
no . <EOS> uh instead of that maybe we can change the colour of the assembler . <EOS> maybe we can just <EOS> if users want more colours they can pay more money to get this mm-hmm . <EOS> uh the shapes and they can have different assembly . um , i am here . <EOS>
yeah , sure . go ahead . <EOS> um so <EOS> it was open here . <EOS> um we also um asked if w they would , if people would pay more for speech recognition in a remote control . <EOS> well <EOS> you can see here , our target group would not do that . <EOS> so if that would increase the price for which we're selling our remote control <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> and you could ask things . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> you had information i didn't have <EOS> and then uh <EOS> oh right . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> and for me it sometimes was a surprise who was going to present what , huh ? <EOS> and uh <EOS>
ha . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yes . <EOS> thanks . <EOS> alright , so <EOS> from when we were discussing specifying the case in the last meeting , we decided that we wanted an ergonomic shape , <EOS> the material that we chose was wood , <EOS> and uh the colour would be customisable , <EOS> 'cause you can stain the wood whatever colour . <EOS> um , <EOS> so in terms of function , you have to be able to turn the t_v_ on and off , volume and channel control , menu control , voice recognition control , <EOS> and we've incorporated the l_c_d_ screen on the flip panel as part of the design , <EOS> if we figure out it's too expensive , well then you just take it off . <EOS> um , so <EOS> to unveil our lovely product . <EOS>
actually how <EOS> actually i would say maybe two two function buttons , the y we're now using the menus button and um and an og and an okay button . <EOS> i mean certainly something i've found with the joystick on mo the joysticks on mobile phones is that a lot of the time th the device mistakes you trying to move it in one direction or the other for pushing down for okay . <EOS>
hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> mm . <EOS> and something we forgot , maybe , <EOS> uh about the speech recognition system , are we going to use it , or not ? <EOS> yes , i think . i think so . <EOS> i think it's important . <EOS> i think one of our p priorities is tech technology . <EOS> and <EOS>
okay . <EOS> now as an interface designer , i would give more emphasis on the interface , how the remote looks like <EOS> so that it is sellable , it is attractive to customers . <EOS> next , please . <EOS> okay . now the function of a remote is to send messages to the television . <EOS> this messages could be uh switch on-off message or switch to next channel message or swapping the channels or switching onto a particular channel , <EOS> like you can have the numbers one , two , three , four , up to nine . <EOS>
right , um <EOS> huh . <EOS> we have new project requirements , um <EOS> we're not going to be using teletext , <EOS> um apparently the consumers consider it outdated with the internet now . um <EOS> okay . <EOS> our control is only going to be for t_v_ , <EOS> it's not going to be a combined control , <EOS> which limits you know all of the different things that <EOS> it limits the cost for us , <EOS> but it also makes it easier to understand for the consumer . <EOS>
ah 'kay . <EOS> i like the the the the logo on there as well . <EOS> it's very prominent . <EOS> it is very prominent . <EOS> so this is the <EOS> so <EOS> here i'll give you the <EOS> so this is the cradle unit , <EOS> and this is the actual remote itself . <EOS> um so the scroll bar is or the scroll wheel is this this green little scrolly guy here , <EOS> um and then the volume controls are here and here . <EOS> uh you've got the keypad which is the numbers uh f from zero to nine and then ten . <EOS> this is the power button . <EOS> uh we have our um <EOS> we have the enter button <EOS> and uh what was the other button here ? <EOS>
no . <EOS> anyone wanna play i spy ? <EOS> mm mm . <EOS> i guess it's probably better that we wrap it up than have five minutes of silence . <EOS> should we call the day then ? <EOS> yeah , i guess . <EOS> i mean we're gonna get asked to fill out another questionnaire . <EOS>
so <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> more sort of um flesh-like than plasticky sort of . <EOS> mm-hmm , mm-hmm . <EOS> wow . <EOS> um but we have to take care like <EOS> but we have to take care of our children also <EOS> if they <EOS> means if children catch hold of your or if they chew it it shouldn't be too harmful . <EOS> so , whatever material we use it should be yeah . <EOS>
um , so we've revisited the touch screen <EOS> and more or less ruled that out , <EOS> um , i think so we're more or less con we wh wh <EOS> we're more or less in agreement that we want to have a um a simple kind of function , you know , not too complex . <EOS>
i'm afraid yeah . <EOS> we'll go into that a bit more , <EOS> but please go on . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> this design could be done with um with uh plastic casing . <EOS> though i would recommend around the grip part here in the middle , having maybe just a rubber grip over that <EOS> which would allow for a slightly more sort of bio-morphic form , and a bit more ergonomic as well . <EOS> as for the um as for the single curve , um well this edge and this edge , like i say it would be nice to have some curvature to it , <EOS> but it's not absolutely necessary . <EOS> really the curve that's most needed is the underside <EOS> so that the jo so that the joystick rests over the the edge of the hand like this . <EOS> um and you have the uh transmitter here and a wee speaker for the uh for the uh for the uh fi uh for the remote control finder . <EOS>
right . <EOS> yeah okay . <EOS> i'm sorry . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> sorry boss . <EOS> oh p pedro , i just want to say quickly i i would really like it when you can come up with some more bells and whistles , eh . <EOS> you know sell uh things come to my mind is uh uh something that's uh um voice-activated . <EOS> i know we're getting into some , i hope , some big money on this thing , but <EOS>
so , um <EOS> so now we we should take the decision what we are going to what function we will have on this uh on this remote control . <EOS> so , mm , are we going to use l_c_d_ , speech recognition ? <EOS> uh . <EOS> well , should we start with just the core , the basic functions that we need . <EOS> and then we can move on to the more advanced features . <EOS>
'kay . <EOS> when you stay in it's good , when you don't stay in you have to redesign . <EOS> there is no uh no negotiation uh possible in this matter . <EOS> so we have to consider that . <EOS> good . <EOS> yep . <EOS> um so <EOS> maybe anna , you can have your presentation . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> s <EOS> technical accessoire ? <EOS> interface ? <EOS> no no no . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> this . <EOS> mm . <EOS> so uh <EOS> first i will present the concept of user interface . <EOS> um there's three concepts in the user interface . <EOS> so first one it's a google controller . <EOS> the second is a fancy controller . <EOS> the last one is uh intelligent controller . <EOS> so there are three concepts in our controller . <EOS> um n next i will explain one by one , <EOS> the first is google controller . <EOS> um , so <EOS> i want the controller to be easy to use , but with sophisticated functions . <EOS> so it's a combination of easy to use and um sophisticated functions . <EOS> uh this is a first concept of our controller . <EOS> the second concept is a fancy controller , <EOS> um so <EOS> we want give the customers the impression that our controller is very attractive , <EOS> um they can easy recognise our controller among a lot of products , <EOS> so so <EOS> the u the user f the the u user interface should be very very cute , very very g um <EOS>
well <EOS> there are of course certain restrictions , <EOS> you can't have it be any form and fulfil all functions at the same time , <EOS> so there are always the some restrictions <EOS> we have to apply here . <EOS> um however um one question is how stable is that thing supposed to be , <EOS> that refers to the material , pretty much um . <EOS> what are we gonna build that thing out of ? <EOS> how sturdy is it gonna be ? <EOS> do we want it to last longer <EOS> or rather have people <EOS>
who's the usability engineering ? <EOS> she is . <EOS> that's me . <EOS> but i'm going to look if i've got some examples <EOS> 'cause perhaps you should choose what's most often used . <EOS> the <EOS> 'cause they can use that better . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> oh . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> um so my name is maarika . <EOS> where's the pen ? <EOS> okay . <EOS> there's a an <EOS> if you have not enough room there's an eraser there <EOS> and you can rub it off . <EOS> yeah , well , <EOS> or i can make it smaller . <EOS> uh so um um <EOS> i'm the interface designer in this project <EOS> and my favourite animal , <EOS> i m i mean i'm not so sure because i'm not so so very um familiar with all kinds of animals , <EOS> but i do like dogs . <EOS> oh , sorry , <EOS> maybe i should have shouldn't have said it beforehand but <EOS> mm hmm . <EOS>
maybe what you can do a test . put it outside , and if bees come , it's really fruit . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i i think i like the the colour a the colour are very good , so actually so <EOS> okay . <EOS> but don't put sugar in it , it's not working . <EOS>
no . <EOS> huh . <EOS> i guess that's right . it always comes with the t_v_ . <EOS> so , um <EOS> but i mean it's <EOS> i've never had a hard time with like my remotes , <EOS> like bringing up the menu screen if you need to like change the date or whatever , you know . <EOS> and i don't think that should uh that should be too hard . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> so . <EOS> um and uh i could <EOS> oh yes . <EOS> additional feature on the back is that you can have your own customised backing <EOS> and i suppose you could do the same thing on the flip case on the front . <EOS> so that you can really make this a highly highly customisable remote control . <EOS>
um . <EOS> yep , <EOS> left-right balance , <EOS> um maybe even pre-programmed sound modes , <EOS> like um the user could determine like a series of sound modes , <EOS> and then what could happen would be um when you click on that then it would go to that setting . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> i have another thing to say about the easy to use aspect . <EOS> i think the easy to use uh aspect is different for different people . <EOS> for the young generation easy to use may be very complicated <EOS> because uh they w they wants lot of controls with lots of buttons . <EOS> for kids they want simply the s similarit for the old people they want simplicity , <EOS> so that's why we have the parental module . <EOS>
sure . <EOS> sure . <EOS> yep . <EOS> okay . <EOS> and then k i suppose quite likely what would happen is in the d device category there might be some which are just like the habitual standard <EOS> and then others which are maybe a bit more <EOS> yeah . sure , okay . okay . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> uh-huh . <EOS> uh-huh , <EOS> and then actual numbers for channels as well , yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> um , you say that's a h a required one or a requested one ? <EOS> would you like <EOS> um the channels like the the numbers on thing , um <EOS>
no <EOS> actually <EOS> i if i it is like <EOS> you know <EOS> it tells you um , <EOS> it can be for two purposes , <EOS> like if you have an l_c_d_ display and all those things it's not going to be the standard remote , <EOS> which is having <EOS> uh which need just uh six six volt uh th sorry three volts um of d_c_ . <EOS>
an adv an adv and it will be covered in some kind of uh thin rubber layer or something like that . <EOS> okay . <EOS> mm . <EOS> and <EOS> exactly . exactly . <EOS> we just have to make sure that the closing mechanism won't break . <EOS> th it's very solid yeah . <EOS>
so i think what we <EOS> so that's what i'm saying <EOS> we're really looking for something basic . <EOS> the the one thing that that that you said really struck a chord with me here in that we're we're carrying the corporate identity with the product , <EOS> but we're actually looking for a large profit at the same time <EOS> where i'd be inclined to go back to upper-level management and say like let's just cut down our profit expected on this product because we are actually branding our company here . <EOS> we're selling more than just the product . <EOS> we're trying to get mind-share about uh real reaction to to the people who are gonna buy consumer electronics . <EOS> we want people to eventually say , oh that's that's real reaction that's a good m make . it's reliable . <EOS>
mm , yeah , <EOS> that weird i dunno what that is , <EOS> but yeah . <EOS> uh . <EOS> a kind of <EOS> yeah . <EOS> oh <EOS> mm . <EOS> also means you can drop it without damaging it . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> that's c cool . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> and i think we if we could just talk about that if we really need a wheel sensor or if we can not if if we could combine something with the push button . <EOS> okay . <EOS> uh a wheel sensor is fifty time the price of a a a push button . <EOS>
lemon . <EOS> well that's kind of <EOS> okay , the blue the blue colours and don't re don't actually represent the colour , <EOS> except for the b the the red button , <EOS> they because for want of a <EOS> yeah . <EOS> sorta . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS>
right , <EOS> i've not come across that function <EOS> but it sounds wonderful . <EOS> it is <EOS> after um <EOS> if you look in the newspaper , t_v_ guide or any t_v_ guide there's a five , six digit number afterwards <EOS> and that's the number you put in <EOS> and it's recorded that it's going to be on on tuesdays at ten o'clock on the seventeenth <EOS> so you don't have to worry about dates <EOS> and you don't have to worry about times , <EOS> um and it has been around for quite a long time . <EOS>
yeah , be the screens . <EOS> is it possible to open pen drawings in this uh on this screen ? <EOS> no no no . <EOS> only <EOS> all the drawings go there , at the left uh <EOS> uh but um which <EOS> the ones we made on the <EOS>
but th what's our ballpark as to what we'd be able to sell something like this for ? <EOS> well y yeah . <EOS> let's let's try and think now , how much would you pay for <EOS> with all these features how much would you pay <EOS> if you went to the store , and you were in the market f to replace your t_v_ remote , how much would you pay for that ? <EOS>
yeah , uh <EOS> i dunno . <EOS> but the ipod and etcetera , m_p_ three players , mobile phones . <EOS> it has to be <EOS> uh a bit . just just on the top or on the bottom . <EOS> just a bit <EOS> cur <EOS> okay , <EOS> i'll see if i can see any of those . <EOS>
oh . <EOS> yeah , uh no <EOS> because particularly if they've dif if they're gonna have it as a you know as a fashion item <EOS> uh i mean it it's uh it it's just i mean it's just a minor detailed point , <EOS> but um as you say you can just make the base a little bit bigger <EOS> and uh <EOS>
okay . <EOS> and we've got our user interface designer . <EOS> he's also uh <EOS> yep . <EOS> that's about the new remote control . <EOS> uh project method um is uh there are three phases we are going through . <EOS> first is functional des uh design , individual work , meetings . <EOS> after the functional design , then the conceptual design and the detailed design . <EOS> i had some role indications on here . <EOS> but i think you know it already by yourself . <EOS> the industrial designer is going to work on the working design , uh components design and a bit of the look and feel design . <EOS> uh the user interface designer is going to do the technical function design , user interface concept and user interface design . <EOS> and the marketing expert is doing a little bit of user requirement specification , trend watching and project uh product ev evaluation . <EOS> so that's a bit what you're going to do . <EOS> but that will be all worked out in uh other meetings . <EOS>
i think so . <EOS> and even then we did get a decent product turned out <EOS> although it's not everything we wanted it to be . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> with the natural look . <EOS> that's very natural . <EOS> very natural look . <EOS> organic , really . <EOS> and highly resourceful team mates might i add <EOS> which is always a plus . <EOS>
or sort of our work on setting this up . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> well , is it <EOS> uh okay i'll just go through your system then . <EOS> the the room uh is fairly institutional , <EOS> but um the main thing is , i think um our use of this space is more just to report on things as opposed to be creative and constructive <EOS> and it would probably help to um have l sort of a cumulative effect of we have ideas and we come back and then the ideas are still in discussion , you know , <EOS> as in other words this this room is sort of a centre point of creativity , <EOS> whereas in reality as we've gone through this , it's not really the centre point of creativity , it's more just a <EOS>
and then there's also the concern about you know um how do you get to the menu if you wanna change the brightness of your television , <EOS> or if you want to um you know switch around , i don't know , like , these different modes <EOS> like turn on the timer or like something something like that , <EOS> like <EOS>
mm . okay it's uh decline . <EOS> okay . <EOS> mm-hmm . decline with age , mm . mm . mm . <EOS> yes . we will talk about it later . okay . <EOS> did you get the email ? <EOS> yep , <EOS> that one . <EOS> just follow that link . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> so we are looking for something that looks good and just works , rather than looking for any special features . <EOS> is that <EOS> i think the more bells and whistles we add , it's just gonna cut into our into our profits . <EOS> because i think as we as we add costs for things like uh for like if we add the voice recognition and things like that , i think you know what percentage of the of the um of the market is actually gonna use that ? <EOS> maybe five percent , you know , <EOS> and how much <EOS>
excuse my language . <EOS> sure . <EOS> i don't know how to draw its face . <EOS> but you get the idea . <EOS> it's a cat . <EOS> it's my favourite uh pet animal , <EOS> 'cause they're cute , they're independent and cuddly , <EOS> i dunno . <EOS> that's it . <EOS> or do i need to use more colours <EOS> and <EOS>
s <EOS> oh , <EOS> i was gonna talk about the programmable remote control . <EOS> now i think it'd be cool if you had one remote control that could work with all t_v_s , <EOS> you know <EOS> you s you click a button <EOS> and it finds the frequency <EOS> that works with your particular television . <EOS> but why you'd need to program it like as as a standard feature , <EOS> i i don't know . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> everybody ready ? <EOS> uh i think the first thing we do is introduce ourselves <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i think so . <EOS> yeah , that's a good plan . <EOS> and everybody's name and what your function is ? <EOS> so maybe we start with you ? <EOS>
something like customised . yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> mm hmm hmm hmm . <EOS> hmm okay . <EOS> it's pretty flexible in the yeah price . <EOS> you also have the the the two other modules for the parental control <EOS> but <EOS> uh yeah yeah <EOS> you should present that . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> first i want to discuss the goals of this meeting . <EOS> first we need to determine the user requirements <EOS> and the question that we can ask ourselves is what needs and desires are to be fulfilled by this remote control . <EOS> and then we're going to determine the technical functions , what is the effect of the apparatus , <EOS> what actually is it supposed to do , what do people pick up the remote and use it for . <EOS> and then lastly we're going to determine its working design , how exactly will it perform its functions , <EOS> that's the whole technical side of <EOS> 'kay i'll just give you a minute , 'cause it looks like you're making some notes . <EOS>
but there are certain restrictions to certain materials . <EOS> now let's first go through the list with the materials . <EOS> so we what we can use is plastic , rubber , wood and titanium . <EOS> can also mix these . <EOS> um as for the energy source , um we were talking about that shortly in the other meeting . <EOS> um what we could use is , or what i was offered , or what we could use , is a basic bateer battery . <EOS> right ? <EOS> uh a dynamo . <EOS> interestingly enough . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> i'm j i really can't get my head round this one , <EOS> this may have to be postponed to a future meeting <EOS> but it's something we should think about . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i yeah i was just thinking about how you could combat that <EOS> 'cause without without doing something where you have to move your arm around to change the channel <EOS> and it becomes <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> and we have put these different colours so that people don't mistake them mistake it as a banana . <EOS> otherwise it's you know a child comes and so <EOS> ok <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah yeah yeah , i see . i under i understand . <EOS>
ah yeah. . <EOS> right . <EOS> you have you have to have the slogan on it or can it just be like <EOS> the slogan on it ? <EOS> no no no . <EOS> no , no , definitely not . <EOS> okay <EOS> good . <EOS> we <EOS> 'cause i was like , it could go around the outside . <EOS>
alright , that did nothing . <EOS> okay . <EOS> welcome to the meeting everyone . <EOS> just gonna attempt to make this into a slide show . <EOS> sorry guys . <EOS> you may have to do the function f_ eight thing . <EOS> oh , okay . <EOS> i did . twice . <EOS> this'll just take a moment . <EOS>
s s simple , simple , yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> zero for the others . <EOS> and sample sensor , sample speaker . <EOS> one ? <EOS> mm . one maybe , yeah . <EOS> as we have voice recognition , i think . <EOS> yeah yeah yeah . <EOS>
if it comes from above . <EOS> people aren't gonna want their remote to boot up and to see flashing things come on . <EOS> they just want it to be on and ready to go . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> well <EOS> fair enough . <EOS> um and yeah <EOS> that would help the battery life too <EOS> and if it the remote they do have to press a button for the remote to turn on . <EOS> but then again who wants to turn on a remote control . <EOS> kind of if i <EOS>
we got our perfect remote control with a lot of buttons <EOS> and uh we got explanation for every button <EOS> and you can use your time and uh it will take i some days to learn all this buttons <EOS> and um the l_c_d_ is going to be somewhere here <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> so yeah , <EOS> that <EOS> i don't think that is the best way to work at for such project . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> no . <EOS> so you would say uh communicate during our individual uh work . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> no , <EOS> or maybe session of five minutes together or something , <EOS> and then work separate . <EOS>
uh-huh . <EOS> or <EOS> the power button could be like a big apple or something . <EOS> mm . <EOS> well yeah , but apple would sue you for that . <EOS> yeah , this is true . <EOS> they don they don't own all images of apples . <EOS>
oh , okay . <EOS> fine . <EOS> favourite characteristics ? <EOS> 'kay . <EOS> so <EOS> they have team elements . <EOS> do you have a favourite one ? <EOS> i'm afraid i'm with steph . <EOS> and i think your pen's running out of whatever . <EOS> but i'm afraid i take the coward's way out , <EOS> and the cat's looking the other way . <EOS> he's hiding . <EOS>
ah yeah . <EOS> maybe have uh <EOS> uh if you th look at the market , it's probably it's still the best way just to put batteries in it , <EOS> because maybe it's too expensive . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> 'cause well <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> but a home station is uh a really good idea , <EOS> because uh lots of people are uh lose their remote control and don't know where it is , <EOS> and now you can put it always at the same place . <EOS> maybe it's <EOS>
oh , <EOS> so still a little bit people <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah that's right . <EOS> but you don't want to alienate the other uh <EOS> no , that not now , <EOS> but , so <EOS> but if they also buy it then it's alright . i guess . <EOS>
mm yeah . <EOS> um so we can improve what's out there and maintain that , the basic functionality that people want . <EOS> um so things that seem like absolute must-haves uh would be a volume control , <EOS> um so up-down keys for that , <EOS> uh channel keys up-down , <EOS> but then also a numerical key pad so that they can just key directly to the channel that they want , rather than doing up-down , <EOS> and uh a mute button . <EOS> uh one thing that i didn't include here , that i forgot that we talked about last time , was doing um some sort of lock uh function . <EOS> uh , i don't i dunno , <EOS> uh that's one possibility . <EOS>
okay well , <EOS> i can do mine . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> do you want the cable ? <EOS> yeah , <EOS> let's see if i can make this work . um . <EOS> oh , <EOS> you have to hit like function and f_ something . <EOS> oh . <EOS>
okay . um <EOS> kate . <EOS> oh i'm sorry , oh sorry . <EOS> um p there we go . <EOS> 'kay , <EOS> i'll just be talking about the components design . <EOS> and <EOS> okay , <EOS> basically i just uh looked at what exactly do remotes do . <EOS> uh basically they wait for you to press a key or give a voice command <EOS> and then this is translated uh into uh light signals <EOS> which are then seen by the t_v_ . <EOS> uh the materials we're gonna need to look at uh the two big ones are the integrated circuit chip and the battery <EOS> and the in integrated circuit chip uh works in conjunction with a a diode transistor or resonator , uh two more resistors and a capacitor <EOS> and the battery works in conjunction with a resistor and a capacitor . um . <EOS> uh basically what happens is you'll press a number or give a voice command <EOS> and this creates a a connection within the the remote <EOS> that allows the chip <EOS> the chip then senses this connection <EOS> and produces a signal in a morse code format . <EOS> this signal's sent to the transistor <EOS> which amplifies it <EOS> and then sends it on to the light emitting diode <EOS> and uh <EOS> which is then trai changed into a infrared light <EOS> which is sent to the t_v_ <EOS> and sort of seen by the t_v_ <EOS> and which uh changes the channels . <EOS> um . oh . uh <EOS> cool . <EOS> uh so <EOS> as for how we should end up uh using this in our remote uh t couple of main questions are the buttons . <EOS> uh y the fewer buttons you have , i guess the fewer internal connections and internal codes you're gonna need . um <EOS> however uh to n not have buttons or to use a voice commands instead of buttons might make these connections more difficult <EOS> and uh raise the production cost . <EOS> that's something we should think about . <EOS> also we have to work within the company constraints , <EOS> and the company has informed me via email that uh they're experts at pushbuttons <EOS> and that seems to be the most uh cost-effective way of producing it . <EOS> um also with battery connections the company has some limits on the batteries we can use , <EOS> so i was thinking perhaps a combination of solar cells with a back-up basic battery <EOS> and somehow between the combination of that two we might be able to come up with something that uh will last the the lifetime or the five to ten years <EOS> and we could still keep that original idea . <EOS> um we also need to look at the chips , uh v custom-designed versus off the shelf , <EOS> and the custom-designed will give us much more flexibility <EOS> and enable us to incorporate the voice function that we all uh seem to have agreed upon . <EOS> um , however that's gonna cost more , <EOS> but uh the off the shelf is gonna be uh cheaper <EOS> and it's gonna be allow us to produce it quicker and get out there faster , <EOS> but it's going to be less flexible with the features , especially things like uh voice activation , <EOS> which haven't really been used much on remotes , <EOS> so there's not really chips out there that would be easy to uh to convert , <EOS> so if we were uh definitely gonna go with the the voice option we'd probably have to design um our own chip . <EOS> and that pretty much sums it up . <EOS>
well so the um <EOS> it's ergonomic , <EOS> but that's not that's that's a design that's a des that's a design thing , yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , but that's not a technological thing , that's another thing , i that's another marketing thing . <EOS> so on the technical side of it it <EOS>
uh-huh . <EOS> okay . <EOS> no . <EOS> no . <EOS> no ? <EOS> okay well <EOS> i think then we have to head uh back to our offices and uh start working . <EOS> i have one question . <EOS> where does it says we have to make a remote , <EOS> because i presumed <EOS>
industrial , yes . <EOS> i'm uh tim . <EOS> um my function is the marketing expert . <EOS> okay , <EOS> thank you . <EOS> first a little about the project aim . <EOS> uh the the the aim is to make a new remote control . <EOS> uh maybe you have read uh read the website . <EOS> it's a very uh , yeah , very uh ambitious uh company . <EOS> they uh they wanna do something else . <EOS> i w <EOS> uh there must be a new remote control . <EOS> uh first of all uh it must be original , uh and trendy . <EOS> that's two things really uh close to each other . <EOS> but at the same time uh user-friendly . <EOS> and they have uh <EOS> yeah , <EOS> that's uh very important uh for them . <EOS> uh there are three stages . <EOS> there is a functional design . <EOS> so uh <EOS> what are we going uh to uh to do ? <EOS> what are we going to uh uh make f uh kind of functions in the remote ? <EOS> and why are we going to do it ? <EOS> then the conceptual design . <EOS> how are going to do it ? <EOS> and that's uh really global . <EOS> uh because at the detailed design , how , part two , uh we go uh to dig in uh really about how the the te the technical of if it's uh it's possible technical-wise . <EOS>
i think we got it already . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> they're pretty heavy . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> uh . faster laptop . <EOS> uh . they were they were just fine . <EOS> but that's not really uh <EOS> and furthermore the the the network was okay . <EOS> everything you loaded was also <EOS>
yeah , you want to show the beautiful banana you have . <EOS> s s <EOS> or might be it does some other kind of thing but <EOS> still i i'd say two . <EOS> i don't think i at any stage in my life i would want a banana remote control , really . <EOS>
you know i guess you could actually train the remote control as you're using it by saying you know turn volume up , and you press the uh press the button <EOS> like uh s people teach sign language to kids f well , by speaking and doing <EOS> yeah but uh as soon as you try to put the microchip kind of thing or something the price will go up . <EOS> so these are the slight problems . <EOS>
uh <EOS> mm . <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> i d i don't know n something about ergonomic kind of fits-in-the-hand uh stuff . <EOS> it the th th <EOS> no . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> but i i think it's still for older people . <EOS> you j still have older people . <EOS> it's only annoying if it if it's like that f formed like that , <EOS> like f <EOS> whatever . <EOS> just you have a normal <EOS>
the zap <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah <EOS> i guess the i think the key word there is average , <EOS> 'cause there were some people that used the uh video input and sound and stuff . <EOS> but they're not you and i really . <EOS> so . <EOS> okay so one ? <EOS> okay . <EOS> number seven . <EOS> c heather could you push it down ? <EOS> will this remote control be easy to find when lost ? <EOS> remember that fifty percent of users lose their remote regularly . <EOS> now is there the <EOS> is the alarm system still was it implemented ? <EOS>
yeah , and no internet . <EOS> misses . i do . <EOS> there's so much available . <EOS> like it's information <EOS> and the digital the digital pens <EOS> were <EOS> they were pretty cool . <EOS> yeah they were fun , even though i'm not really sure what i could do with them , <EOS> but they are awesome . <EOS>
uh well , <EOS> it's an idea <EOS> in a so . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> oh <EOS> y you <EOS> perhaps you should make it a bit big , <EOS> so people know it's there <EOS> and uh <EOS> do not forget it . <EOS> uh <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS>
no , <EOS> it's a two . <EOS> little bit strange we have to judge that ourselves , <EOS> huh ? <EOS> yeah , <EOS> i n used i wouldn i should use that one , but it doesn't <EOS> yeah . <EOS> but it's a one uh <EOS> maybe uh <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> i would first m <EOS> yeah well <EOS> i i was <EOS> yeah i understand . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i i think we have first to start with the basic functions <EOS> and we can uh expand them . <EOS> yeah .
mm-hmm . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> um some remotes have kind of favourite options <EOS> where if you always flick from channel one to channel six , um if that's a favourite you just like by-pass two to five . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah , i s i suppose in a sense you could have um if you've got a hundred channels then if you had sort of an easy way of getting rather than having to go one to a hundred , you could go one to one to ten , ten to twenty <EOS> and then have a second button to get you to the actual channel you want <EOS> and that would cut down your time . <EOS> anyway . <EOS>
how much would that save us ? <EOS> one . <EOS> that is one . <EOS> do something on the t_v_ , the t_v_ responds and reacts as well , <EOS> so the user could be looking at the t_v_ and pushing his thing <EOS> so we may not need to <EOS> so when we scroll we need just some way to get the t_v_ to respond , <EOS> which i think is a technically doable thing so <EOS>
uh-huh . <EOS> . yeah <EOS> d <EOS> no <EOS> i mean do you think there's a risk if it doesn't look like remote control , <EOS> people won't see it as a remote control <EOS> um and uh <EOS> uh i suppose suppose that's up to the marketing to to make make people aware of the product . <EOS>
great . <EOS> so it <EOS> and we have ninja homer . <EOS> so now we <EOS> oh yeah . <EOS> well apparently now i write the final report . <EOS> what are you guys doing now ? <EOS> do we know what the other ones are ? <EOS> i i don't know . <EOS>
no . a mouse is not too difficult . <EOS> mouse is okay . <EOS> yeah , it's okay . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> just go , <EOS> you you the closest to the whiteboard . <EOS> okay , <EOS> go <EOS> right , but in grow , it's <EOS> everybody has to grow <EOS>
and <EOS> these mm-hmm <EOS> on both sides they're mute ? <EOS> so you can push either one ? <EOS> okay . <EOS> yes . <EOS> so if you're left-handed or right-handed it doesn't matter . <EOS> and this brings the menu up on the screen ? <EOS> this brings the menu up on the screen <EOS> and the orange ones are <EOS>
right . <EOS> so uh <EOS> well , we could give it a specific code , you know , remote missing . <EOS> ooh . <EOS> uh see i'm uh i'm strangely attracted to it , <EOS> because i know that's it's definitely gonna be big , <EOS> because it's , i don't know , it's just so high-tech . <EOS>
yeah , it's very easy . <EOS> yeah but this this turning <EOS> can you can you just re explain me the <EOS> you can use this in this way . <EOS> as a principle . <EOS> please . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> th this is the base . <EOS> so you can turn to change the channel . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> uh <EOS> that's my job . <EOS> that's the <EOS> okay , <EOS> i'm sorry . <EOS> so <EOS> now the <EOS> yeah <EOS> but , it should be an agreement , <EOS> you know , <EOS> because even if you can think of the wireless , it is it's it is the job of the the the g graphical user designer , <EOS> but you know . <EOS> if it is a lot cheaper and if you want to reach for example some the the money you have , if you want to use , so it can be good to have a wireless , <EOS> it it is a question . <EOS> right , so .
which button ? <EOS> another one . <EOS> are they all gonna have our company logo on them ? <EOS> every cover ? <EOS> yeah , i don't think we should do that , because that would just be icky . <EOS> so i think maybe putting it on a button is probably a good idea . <EOS>
okay , so when you have a lot of room inside . <EOS> so you can make it very easy to use . 'cause you can write a lot of comments besides it . <EOS> think that's better . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so you can show your prototype if you want to . <EOS>
that'd be , that'd be good if we were going with our our ball . <EOS> yeah it would be quite good . <EOS> the ball could sit on a <EOS> or or with you know i guess with any form that that would be good . <EOS> you know <EOS> that could be the charger . <EOS> for <EOS> you know <EOS> we could use rechargeable batteries in the remote . <EOS> and that would be <EOS> or solar . <EOS> or <EOS> you know <EOS> however , however you wanted to go about it , the holder could also be the charging unit . um <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> sure , yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> i dunno . <EOS> it's an certainly a different colour from your average um <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> make it harder to lose , as well . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> that's true . <EOS> was there anything in your research <EOS>
okay . that's a good idea , <EOS> i <EOS> okay , that's a good idea . <EOS> so titanium smell like fruit . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> that's <EOS> so <EOS> what about location and these things , people are really interesting on those features ? <EOS> or they really like
yeah . <EOS> yeah uh , <EOS> the receiver is of course already in the television <EOS> and we are not uh able to change it . <EOS> so we we must adapt to the to the receiver . <EOS> i i suppose there is a standard uh way of communicating to televisions uh . <EOS>
young means sixteen to forty years . <EOS> and elderly from forty eight to their death . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> i was uh <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i think it's <EOS> i think it's the most useful uh remote control ever to be manufactured . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> but because it has the regular uh controls , <EOS> li <EOS> uh as you can see in the screen now , <EOS> and uh <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah <EOS> i kept it global <EOS> 'cause <EOS> that it activates or deactivates specific functions , <EOS> 'cause i wasn't thinking yet about that . <EOS> i mean , you wanna ch ch flip the channel <EOS> but you might wanna use teletext also . <EOS> i dunno what the word is in english . uh <EOS>
hmm . <EOS> and findings , uh i found out uh y um on different sites that uh there are different remotes which can be used , <EOS> there are remotes which use the infrared for controlling the different functionalities , <EOS> there are remotes which use the radio waves to control the functions <EOS> and there are uh <EOS> so uh there you have different uh types of remotes for different light source which are used which can be used for controlling the different functionalities of a television . <EOS> next slide . <EOS> and these are my few personal preferences <EOS> like it can be used for a multipurpose use . <EOS> not , uh no <EOS> uh like it can it can be used as a t_v_ control as plus an alarm clock to set an alarm a timing <EOS> and it should have a child lock , <EOS> and then to save electricity uh there should not be uh much s move uh lots of circuits and all that . <EOS> and if a person if if if parents wants the television to be switched off by ten o'clock then it should be switched off ten o at ten o'clock automatically , so that nobody else comes later and use it . <EOS>
speech recognition? . <EOS> and we're talking between seventy-five to ninety percent of this group is willing to pay for speech recognition on a remote . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> obviously , we can't make a remote into a computer , <EOS> but maybe simple commands . <EOS> i dunno , <EOS> louder , softer , on , off . <EOS> that might be a possibility , even though it costs more , to be the first on the market to produce this . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> so if you have a universal t_v_ controller , you needed one button that has two uh stripes . <EOS> so we have a a period of , i dunno , five seconds to press those buttons , and that and not for elderly people to look , one two uh press and aim and <EOS>
okay , yeah , afterwards , yeah , okay . <EOS> right sure . <EOS> uh okay . <EOS> so n uh with uh with regard to the uh working design of this uh uh remote control uh i've identified um a few basic uh components of the remote <EOS> and uh se uh from the design , functional design perspective um w i c we can now uh know wha what exactly the components are <EOS> and how how they work together with each other . <EOS> so <EOS> this is the method that uh i'll mostly be following in my um in my uh role . <EOS> um the identification of the components , <EOS> uh and uh since since i'm dealing only with the technical aspects , i would need feedback from the marketing person uh and uh from the user interface person . <EOS> uh we'll then integrate this into the product design at a technical level <EOS> and uh basically update and come up with a new design , <EOS> so it's a cyclical process . <EOS>
now people are very frustrated w with their remote controls <EOS> and they for instance uh they don't even find it <EOS> it's it's often lost somewhere in the in the in your home <EOS> and nobody knows where it is . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> maybe if we have something where we could ask the remote control please , where are you ? <EOS> like uh something to to like t i think phones . some of the phones have some of this kind of s functionality . <EOS> uh of course phone you can always phone your phone <EOS> but you can't phone your your remote control . <EOS> but why not ? yeah . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> it's rubber . <EOS> yeah <EOS> but but a hard rubber like this ? <EOS> or softer rubber <EOS> or <EOS> yeah . <EOS> uh hard rubber i think . <EOS> that's the easy to ha uh to to uh <EOS> yeah . <EOS> it bounces back from the floor where you throw it . <EOS> yeah yeah <EOS> this in different colours ? <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> and then use the <EOS> so , if you're the kind of sad case that knows how your remote control works , then you know that's fine <EOS> and you can do it on the screen rather than everybody else having to have those buttons , which just confuse them . <EOS> hmm . <EOS>
hmm . <EOS> it's very very quick to access the main features . <EOS> uh you can just about make out uh that the button three buttons are uh previous track , next track and play pause . <EOS> they're the main the main features of the ipod , the things you will use a all the time . <EOS> um then if you want to do anything more advanced , you go into the little menu on the l_c_d_ screen <EOS> and you use the buttons just to scroll around and and find the more advanced features that you want . <EOS> so i think that's that's a good a good kind of model that we could have . um <EOS> here's a another example . <EOS> this is uh it's an interesting idea <EOS> and i think i it looks pretty cool . <EOS> um it's certainly got novelty value . <EOS> uh it's nice and colourful , it's nice and bright . <EOS> uh it's also something that you can kind of feel your way around . <EOS> the buttons are are different shapes <EOS> and and you can sort of <EOS> yeah <EOS> if you're watching t_v_ in the dark or whatever , you can work out which button's which <EOS> and basically , yeah <EOS> it's ith it's fun . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> um minimal number of buttons . <EOS> i guess our , i guess our main um main thing that we should focus on until then is probably deciding on a certain look , you know . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> right . <EOS> that's <EOS> did you have time earlier to to work on that . <EOS> did you guys feel you have enough time in between our meetings to get everything done that you need to get done ? <EOS>
okay . <EOS> cool . <EOS> so see you later . <EOS> okay perfect . <EOS>
so you you're <EOS> participant two . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> um . okay . <EOS> the rationale must be design , or <EOS> so , <EOS> baba is the uh the industrial designer . okay . <EOS> so <EOS> we can move to the next slide . <EOS> as you all know , you know m my job is to design you know uh to give an industrial design of the remote control . <EOS> so the re basically the remote control will be , you know , infrared control , <EOS> so the problem is how to relate the <EOS>
so <EOS> so you you you suggest to go f <EOS> new inputs <EOS> and also it's i'm not convinced about this l_c_d_ <EOS> because you need uh internet connection , you need more things , <EOS> it's not just buying a new control re remote , you need buying control remote , buying uh <EOS>
yeah , that's great for us . <EOS> alright , yeah , no , this i this is good , <EOS> so through all that we've we go we're <EOS> right , we're gonna go go back to um going with the kinetic thing , <EOS> that's great , <EOS> using the spongy rubber that we were talking about <EOS> that anti-r_s_i_ you can as you squeeze it you are not only therapeuticising yourself , you are charging the batteries , <EOS>
well , it's like white on i white and blue on a black background with white with yellow borders . <EOS> maybe that's like getting ahead of ourselves . <EOS> okay . <EOS> well , <EOS> it wouldn't be <EOS> maybe you can come up with a few with a couple of different ideas ? <EOS>
let's . <EOS> obviously <EOS> does it say what does it say for n <EOS> it says on there what we need to do for the next meeting , i think . <EOS> uh . <EOS> must finish now , so . <EOS> and then marketing will look and see what uh what people want . <EOS>
is it really weight ? <EOS> is it light or <EOS> it is very light . <EOS> yeah , they're light . <EOS> okay . <EOS> it's it's uh it's about the weight of a banana . <EOS> okay . <EOS> you know , to give you the correct look and feel . <EOS>
okay , <EOS> but like , kind of convex or concave ? <EOS> so , it could be curve , so it could be convex , conve concave , depending on what what we want . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> okay . <EOS> so there are flats , there are single curve and there are double curves . <EOS> these are the three things , <EOS> and there are different materials , <EOS> with plastic you can have double curve but with uh certain other materials we cannot have double curve . <EOS>
now who are recording this meeting ? <EOS> i think it <EOS> so <EOS> one second . <EOS> so we have to take some decision on this aspect . <EOS> so , uh so for <EOS> sorry , <EOS> for uh component , <EOS> so <EOS> so <EOS> we have to think about those aspects , <EOS> sorry . <EOS>
right . <EOS> oh yeah , i suppose so , yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> so maybe that would be something separate , yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> no . <EOS> okay , <EOS> so we'd have a simple circuit board <EOS> and that would be an extra that would be in addition to it . <EOS> oh that makes sense . <EOS>
yeah , <EOS> but there's the two machines , <EOS> and they're uh the vending machines where you just put the money <EOS> and and you can get <EOS> yeah . yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah , vending machines . <EOS> mm-hmm . okay . <EOS> yeah , maybe this is not a very bad timing . <EOS> could we try to meet uh next tuesday ? <EOS> um , next tuesday maybe at t maybe a bit later ? <EOS> maybe at eleven o'clock ? <EOS>
yeah , lower . <EOS> true . <EOS> that's how it's is usually when i look here <EOS> okay , um . <EOS> that's what i see . <EOS> let's cut to the chase . <EOS> it's got to change . <EOS> yeah well <EOS> i think we have we don't have to decide about that now <EOS> how <EOS> where we will put the buttons <EOS> just the <EOS>
okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> mm we need to move this . <EOS> who wants to go f first ? <EOS> that's as far as it goes . <EOS> uh not really meant to touch those microphones . <EOS> oh it doesn't have any on , <EOS> does it ? <EOS> that's fine . <EOS>
zoom <EOS> yeah . <EOS> hmm . all kinds of possibilities . <EOS> mm . okay . <EOS> sorry , <EOS> i'm just um trying to update my minutes . <EOS> i decided to <EOS> you know how i sent you the email saying that powerpoint minutes will be complimentary , rather than like repeating them . <EOS> just gonna make i'm making full minutes , <EOS> so that it'll include all of the agenda and all that . <EOS> 'cause that seems a little more useful . <EOS>
just the veneer on it , <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> and the final point okay is um we have yeah there are some uh compromise to to do . <EOS> so <EOS> we have to know that the push button requires a simple chip , <EOS> but the scroll wheel uh and that kind of higher high-tech stuff needs more money um which is a higher price range <EOS> alright . <EOS> and the display requires an advanced chip , <EOS> which in turns is more expensive than the regular chip , <EOS> but i think uh with twelve euros um and if it's uh uh made for mm four million uh items , then i think w we could be able to handle that . <EOS> so <EOS> to to sum up um <EOS>
yeah yeah . <EOS> hmm . s <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> i'm not <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i'm not i'm not sure what what what the sort of timescale we're thinking of selling the product over is . <EOS> i don't know . <EOS> i mean it just seems realistic that the remote control market isn't the kind of thing which takes in those kinds of fashion trends . <EOS> to something which is maybe more universal . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> well <EOS> already digital information is sent t to the the standards , t_v_ uh connections , <EOS> you can see what's uh programme is on on the new uh channels , <EOS> so maybe j they we can send that information along with standard t_v_ uh <EOS>
mm . <EOS> i think uh when we think it over i thi i think we are trying to offer the a kind of universal control for for less money . <EOS> mm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so <EOS> d do you agree ? <EOS> well well i it's fine with me like the price as long as it is uh not too expensive . <EOS>
because it <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , that's a good idea . <EOS> it's a lot easier . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> alright . <EOS> so <EOS> what about the user interface , <EOS> there are also some some questions uh about the concepts i think <EOS> you have some ideas on that . <EOS> you you showed your drawing . <EOS>
right . <EOS> yeah , then they have to pick it up and then activate it and then yeah . <EOS> okay , okay . <EOS> right um what are the other options ? <EOS> that's true . <EOS> okay . <EOS> uh there's solar power . um . <EOS> uh , solar power will w also not be a good idea , <EOS> because then they have to keep m their mobiles outside in solar energy , <EOS> and the days when there is no sola sunlight <EOS> yeah . yeah . <EOS> what we w <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i think we should a rechargeable battery will be a good idea . <EOS> they can they can recharge it . <EOS>
um <EOS> uh . <EOS> glow in the dark material i was thinking . <EOS> um , so i i guess that would be cheaper than a light i think . <EOS> okay . <EOS> so <EOS> i <EOS> uh may i say something about ? <EOS> uh actually i think it's really really very important point uh as if we look at the market <EOS> because people mor fifty percent people they find that the remote controls are often lost somewhere in the remote , in the room . <EOS> but <EOS> yeah are lost <EOS> and means they forget where they have kept the remote control last time . <EOS>
technological if they don't need to be , <EOS> 'cause that'll keep our manufacturing price way down . <EOS> that's what i have for options . <EOS> 'kay <EOS> now we're um concepts concepts of user interface . <EOS> yeah , um . <EOS> this one's so much tighter than the other one . <EOS>
they're never universal . that's right . <EOS> esp e especially if you buy a a not big product , d_v_d_ player , say , usually it doesn't work if it's not one of the <EOS> yeah . yeah . <EOS> something from sam's club . <EOS> or if it's not like a sony , if it's like a i don't know . <EOS>
yeah , right . <EOS> so <EOS> you know , so if you have like <EOS> what about what about this shape ? more or less . <EOS> we <EOS> there's less space on this to put with the buttons . <EOS> i if it i if it has really the model shape of a bana you could <EOS> the the starting is good but it could it should have more the shape of a banana if you want to point really a at the thing . <EOS> if you don't want to to to do that movement which is which is difficult <EOS> if you don't have to do it in fact , it's better . <EOS> so ti time is running , <EOS> we have to we have to we have to to move forward . <EOS> so let's skip to uh this uh this this this idea . <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> but um the on-off button , um still on the top uh <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah still here <EOS> jus <EOS> yeah . <EOS> that's <EOS> and i'd prefer the corners to be round . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . 'kay . <EOS> think that would be better . <EOS>
uh-huh . <EOS> okay . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> with the l_c_d_ , you'd only have that with the printed circuit board . <EOS> mm . <EOS> with <EOS> w also with the <EOS> i don't <EOS> s sorry to interrupt , <EOS> i don't see why the curved thing is a problem , <EOS> if we for example had a shell , once we open that <EOS> yeah , so it'd be f yeah , yeah . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> at least we have couple of months t to work on it so so it will be cheaper finally . <EOS> sh okay . <EOS> it is true . <EOS> where's delete button ? <EOS> okay . <EOS> oh i'm sorry . <EOS> okay . <EOS>
yeah we didn't we uh it all c sort of blended quite well . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah i think it more than anything we didn't really have our set roles so much , as we just would be like i don't know , all had ideas about it but <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
sh <EOS> yeah , <EOS> just <EOS> just sub-menu . yeah . <EOS> not directly uh available . <EOS> okay . <EOS> 'cause it should be there . <EOS> not yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay , <EOS> so not too much teletext support , but in a separate menu , <EOS> and <EOS>
what ? <EOS> it draws about four centimetres lower <EOS> than <EOS> nah okay . <EOS> just . <EOS> oh . okay . <EOS> maybe you can make it like this . <EOS> and this is all the wheel for volume . <EOS> so that you just um <EOS> it's all rounded , <EOS> so you can do uh turn this one . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> but just not on the top , but uh on the side of it . <EOS>
mm yeah , <EOS> that's good , that's good . <EOS> ah , <EOS> there we go . <EOS> yeah , it's possible , yeah , yeah . <EOS> here , <EOS> stick it on . <EOS> put an extra the button on . <EOS> sure . <EOS> um uh why don't we do a product evaluation using your criteria , <EOS> if you've developed some ? <EOS>
yeah maybe maybe the fact that they protect their home as well , yeah . <EOS> um what it has to do with with my role in the project is hard to say . <EOS> uh i hope to be loyal to the project <EOS> and not to n not to um let people doing similar projects know the details of our project or something , yeah . <EOS> i'm from estonia <EOS> uh , yep . <EOS> um so is there anything else you'd like to know ? <EOS> oh , right , my roles , <EOS> um so um in the different um stages of the design , so at first i will be responsible for um for yeah , designing the technical functions of the um um of the remote control <EOS>
and uh just with uh together with uh the back-lights b look will look very new . <EOS> no rubber buttons or something . <EOS> just together with the back-lights you'll get a totally new look . more like the m_p_ three player m_ um p_ m_ p_ three player . <EOS>
yeah , it does have yeah . <EOS> absolutely . <EOS> voice control have <EOS> seven . <EOS> hang on , <EOS> how come it's showing up with the things there but it only had bullet points there ? <EOS> that's just <EOS> ah , that's the second one . <EOS> so you must have changed it on this one where it's got score , <EOS> but not on the previous slide . <EOS>
most people , yeah . <EOS> mm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> sure . i think that's fair yeah . <EOS> mm . <EOS> um , i mean <EOS> i imagine as well that the actual l_c_d_ and maybe to a certain extent the joystick as well would be for the additional functionality . <EOS> which maybe doesn't get used as often , <EOS> maybe it makes it easy for them to figure out how to um change the channels as in the frequencies and such for reprogramming it . <EOS> um and you can still have the main buttons that allow the people to turn the machine on and off , d up and down , <EOS> it depends , <EOS> i mean <EOS> maybe we have the fol um the joystick as a separate one for the other functions then , <EOS> that there's just a a small number of as you were saying uh buttons that have already been defined . <EOS> so like <EOS> we go for the nice standard um up and down for and volume control . <EOS> so that literally anybody can come along , pick up the remote and still know what do do . <EOS> and they can completely ignore most of the functionality which would be for say the o actual owner of the the t_v_ <EOS> and who would normally use the unit . <EOS> i dunno . <EOS>
and how was our leadership and teamwork ? <EOS> i think it was good . <EOS> we knew what we were doing . <EOS> it was a very democratic process and everyone got to contribute . <EOS> well i thought my leadership was crap personally . <EOS> excuse me , <EOS> am i allowed to say that ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> um . <EOS>
yeah , <EOS> but um <EOS> yes , that's what i mean . <EOS> or you can switch it on or something . <EOS> or maybe when you <EOS> yeah . <EOS> it lights up all . <EOS> yeah , that's right . <EOS> you have to <EOS> yeah , that's right . <EOS> that's what i said . <EOS> it's the same as the telephone . yeah . <EOS>
hmm . <EOS> repetitive strain injury . <EOS> what ? <EOS> repetitive strain injury . <EOS> so if you <EOS> ah . there we go . <EOS> wow . <EOS> people do not like that . <EOS> so i guess sort of the carpal tunnel type thing , people do not like that , <EOS> um the repetitive use , i guess , caused a strain . <EOS>
right . <EOS> s <EOS> alright . <EOS> but you can of course erase when you make a mistake , <EOS> but don't uh delete entire pages . <EOS> and you can also um let's see i think it's here uh change the uh colour of your pen , <EOS> for instance take a blue one <EOS> and uh change the line width like to five . <EOS> um that's what you will need for our first exercise , <EOS> because i'm uh going to ask you to draw your favourite animal . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> but we might as well . <EOS> so you never have to change the battery . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> we should maybe investigate whether it needs a battery at all . <EOS> i suspect the remote control does need a battery , <EOS> but <EOS> yeah , i would imagine . <EOS> just 'cause it is an electronic device , <EOS> the <EOS>
yeah ? <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yes , no that's important . <EOS> yeah , like smaller . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> and there's no reason we need to make it look as fashionable and stylish as a mobile phone , <EOS> it can still be lightweight plastic , you know ? <EOS> something that's easily moulded and produced . <EOS> sorry i'm treading on your territory guys . <EOS>
but they close at five or ? <EOS> ah okay . <EOS> no . coffee machines . <EOS> okay , okay . <EOS> no , there's the cafeteria is downstairs , <EOS> but they close at five . <EOS> uh-huh . <EOS> five . <EOS> ah that's the main problem . <EOS>
well not everywhere . <EOS> so i think numerals . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> but then you have to choose the <EOS> this always with r universal remotes you have to choose the code . <EOS> you can use which which type of television you have . <EOS> that's no problem . <EOS> but i think like the two pages on the same screen , like teletext and normal television , that's that's nowadays standard , i think . <EOS>
right . <EOS> like maybe have menu things . <EOS> take precedence , <EOS> yeah . <EOS> if , if we're not going the touch-screen route then we can um just incorporate maybe something that folds out <EOS> like what you often see on these kinds of remotes is the most basic functions up here <EOS> and something that slides down to reveal the you know more complicated things . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> uh yeah so <EOS> okay , s so <EOS> simple button and uh speech recognition for the more complicated . <EOS> s s <EOS> speech <EOS> y yeah we have simple buttons and speech recognition technology , <EOS> so <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> um <EOS> are we at ma right now on the assumption that our television remote control may have features which go beyond the television ? <EOS> or are we keeping sort of like a a design commitment to television features ? <EOS> i i don't know . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah , yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> because the powerpoint was provided to us while we had time to prepare , <EOS> whereas i can imagine if i'd been encouraged to use paintbrush , for example , or whatever , i would've actually used it , <EOS> um 'ca you know , <EOS> just 'cause that's sorta how we what we were set up to to use while we had our time . <EOS>
s <EOS> see <EOS> and sponginess . <EOS> and spongy , yeah . <EOS> so maybe an an unidentifiable fruit or fiable fruit or vegetable <EOS> like so it would have a stem perhaps <EOS> and a <EOS> spongy . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> maybe , yeah . <EOS>
no , <EOS> but i that's the thing i i don't think it's necessarily the other end . <EOS> the other the o <EOS> the problem with that in my mind i just think off-hand as a as a consumer , would i wanna buy that ? <EOS> and i think maybe not <EOS> because i've got a remote <EOS> and i'll take it to different chairs , i'll take it to different <EOS> i w i don't wanna go over somewhere and put it down . <EOS>
superb sketch , by the way . <EOS> tail's a bit big , i think . <EOS> i was gonna choose a dog as well . <EOS> but i'll just draw a different kind of dog . <EOS> m my favourite animal is my own dog at home . <EOS> um <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> actually i'm not reading microphone there , <EOS> so that's why you can all have conversation , it just to speak to you . <EOS> well , it's a sample sensor sample speaker . <EOS> sample sensor sample speaker . <EOS> it means that it can recognize , it can do like a match on a on a certain phrase that you speak and then can play back a phrase in response to that . <EOS> but uh there's no kind of um understanding of the phrase . <EOS> so , i mean , you know , <EOS> i guess you could build that in , you could you could link the the recognition of a certain phrase to some function on on the remote control . <EOS> but basically the thing is , we have this technology available <EOS>
bu <EOS> yeah , i agree more like ipod . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yes . <EOS> just okay , <EOS> only the colour and the flashy light <EOS> and the <EOS> we just we just skip the the the voca or was it the the speech recognition . <EOS> a speech . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> do we s keep that ? <EOS> yeah , i think <EOS>
why ? wh why you need that up ? <EOS> hmm ? <EOS> well because i can't remember what i put on there . <EOS> okay . <EOS> now i'm supposed to see how long my leash is here . <EOS> i think you can make it there . <EOS> mm 'kay . <EOS> you ready . <EOS> so now we're all supposed to say what we think . <EOS> um okay so on shape <EOS> i gave it a one . <EOS> wait what would you ra <EOS> uh one being good and seven being the worst . <EOS> um what do you think the shape is ? <EOS> one , okay , <EOS> and be betsy ? <EOS>
uh it is in shared documents ? <EOS> and then uh hit that little folder up thing again . <EOS> where am i ? <EOS> project documents , yeah , it's on your desktop as well . <EOS> projoct uh projector . <EOS> again . <EOS> all the way to the top , yeah that's up to desktop . <EOS> right and then project documents . <EOS>
you don't see it uh at the ears ? <EOS> mm yeah , <EOS> i have it at home . <EOS> you have an orc at home ? <EOS> very artistic . <EOS> thank you . <EOS> so <EOS> it's a cat . <EOS> what's it called ? <EOS> simba . <EOS> 'cause uh we have a cat at home <EOS> and he's called simba . <EOS> 'cause he looks like the uh the the lion from the lion king . <EOS>
but , in the cost that uh the management is looking for , that's not gonna be possible . <EOS> but if it's trendy , <EOS> if it's fancy , <EOS> it's got some colour to it , <EOS> if it's very easy easy to use , <EOS> if it's got simple remote speech remote uh control , like i said , louder , softer , change channel , on , off , remote , it goes beep beep , <EOS> i can find my my remote without spending half a day looking for it and getting all upset <EOS> 'cause i can't turn the t_v_ on . <EOS> so we're gonna have to look at it in a in this global idea , with the ideas of the industrial uh design . <EOS>
yeah . it will do . <EOS> uh uh uh well . <EOS> okay . <EOS> finishing touch <EOS> and then we're going further . <EOS> project manager ? uh <EOS> yeah ? <EOS> where does the pen go ? <EOS> just uh <EOS> have you been uh counting the time ? <EOS>
it's capable of being squishy and fruity . <EOS> sure . capable . very capable . <EOS> oh , it's very capable of being squishy and fruity . <EOS> okay . <EOS> and it's very important . <EOS> 'kay , there we go . <EOS> so . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay , next . <EOS>
yes . <EOS> d <EOS> well <EOS> do you think that's feasible ? <EOS> well <EOS> i don't know if it'll fit into our cost of twelve point five euro you know . <EOS> uh you th you think it's possible . <EOS> is it possible to fit in to that ? <EOS>
number two , <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah exactly . <EOS> okay . <EOS> uh can you make it uh full screen please ? <EOS> okay . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yep . <EOS> no , <EOS> it's like a <EOS> well you you have to press here . <EOS> the cup cup shape here ? <EOS> the thir third . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> but i'd have to look into that a little more . <EOS> okay . <EOS> and different cultures . are we <EOS> well <EOS> i don't think they have different television sets uh <EOS> mm . <EOS> okay . <EOS> in uh every country . <EOS> no . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> if you're going to aim your a um product maybe at the technological kind of sector , then you can afford to maybe jack the price up slightly from what it is . <EOS> because they will pay outrageous cash to <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm . i mean i th i mean i think to r retaining the s the more sort of bio-morphic form in the articulation would gain more in s uh would gain more profit in sales than it would lose in uh <EOS>
doub double-curved . mm . seems to be . <EOS> mm-hmm . okay . <EOS> okay , okay . in fact i just agreed to make uh to make the like titanium panels on a whole rubber body . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> well , okay <EOS> w we'll see . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> is anybody um really against teletext ? <EOS> no . <EOS> no ? <EOS> just that , that we just keep the teletext . <EOS> i think that's a good idea as well , especially for the subtitles . <EOS> maybe we can make that um another point of advantage in our remote control , if we uh make a k a button ex for example for big subtitles , <EOS> which is instantly on the remote control . <EOS> for elderly people they can think , oh i wanna have subtitles , <EOS> and they push the button <EOS> and they get the big subtitles . <EOS>
so could i just ask one question , um <EOS> is this a stand-alone unit that we're gonna be selling ? <EOS> so it's gonna be you already have a t_v_ but you're buying an extra remote control for it or something ? <EOS> o this is the next topic we have to discuss exactly , <EOS> so let's go to it . <EOS>
comes to your whistle . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> that's that's maybe something for the future when you can talk to your television , but <EOS> yeah . <EOS> but is it in a sense it's r um mutually exclusive . <EOS> you can't have both the th the one device and then have few buttons on it to <EOS> 'cause you want you want simplicity as well , <EOS> you want any idiot to be able to use it . <EOS> whilst at the same time you want , as you rightly said , one remote for all . <EOS>
why are you looking at me ? <EOS> would you like to go first ? <EOS> do i have a choice ? <EOS> okay . <EOS> ooh ooh , things falling everywhere . <EOS> right , okay . <EOS> oh , yeah , <EOS> p put them in pockets . <EOS>
and then have to change all change everything at the last minute . <EOS> okay . s <EOS> um . <EOS> oh , that was quick . <EOS> um okay , so very brief presentation , um . <EOS> from looking at the remotes that are out there at the minute , none of them are particularly um sleek and sexy . <EOS> um i haven't actually got the examples of the scroll button there , <EOS> um but there's some curved cases that you can see , uh a range of sizes uh . <EOS> all of them have a lot of buttons there um <EOS> they seem to just have the rubber buttons . <EOS> does that move it ? <EOS>
that's it . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> okay , <EOS> ach that's a shame . <EOS> um right , <EOS> so take away that completely ? <EOS> ah . <EOS> and now we're under budget . <EOS> so we do have point five euro to play with if we wanted . <EOS> um <EOS>
so if <EOS> no , <EOS> go ahead . <EOS> keyboard type shape , you know , like video games <EOS> l so . <EOS> but maybe <EOS> i mean that would be kinda big and bulky . <EOS> we could also try to do the hinge thing , <EOS> so it could like flip out that way . <EOS> i don't know . <EOS>
yeah . i know we can do a lot more , <EOS> but <EOS> yeah , it <EOS> like in this kind of shape <EOS> or <EOS> uh it's very annoying . <EOS> okay . <EOS> i dunno . i dunno if it's handy . <EOS> i think it will only look more like the old remote controls . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> i don't know , <EOS> i d <EOS> i don't like the , you know the new phones that have kind of got a windows-based running system . <EOS> but i don't know how <EOS> oh yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . i find it really confusing , <EOS> i kept getting lost in the phone , <EOS> i di i've not got a new one <EOS> but uh my friend got a new one <EOS> and i was trying to do things with it and i just kept getting lost , <EOS> but
uh <EOS> new . blank . <EOS> okay . <EOS> you have to go t <EOS> let's make it uh black . <EOS> okay . <EOS> i thought of an idea like this . <EOS> oh that . <EOS> um delete . <EOS> blank . <EOS> okay . <EOS> so it also looks nice when it's on your table . <EOS> so you get <EOS> uh it doesn't lay flat down on the table , <EOS> but it's c it's stands . <EOS>
yeah , <EOS> i think it's uh <EOS> because uh this technology is uh um for limited wor or limited wor uh lexical recognition , <EOS> it's very <EOS> yeah , <EOS> but uh uh <EOS> it's uh <EOS> yeah . <EOS> but it's it's changing how the remote control is gonna be built . <EOS> because then you need uh <EOS>
that's yeah , but it <EOS> no no , i want that in . <EOS> but we can we can do it uh underneath the logo . <EOS> no , we need that . that's usable . that's really usable . <EOS> if you do uh <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah , th the speaker is very small as well , <EOS> right ? <EOS>
right . <EOS> right . <EOS> right-handed , <EOS> yeah . <EOS> uh-huh . <EOS> that's right . <EOS> like the written language . or english . <EOS> maybe you could buy like a special left-handed version of the remote . special order . <EOS> maybe . <EOS> ow . <EOS> i would say <EOS> i mean <EOS> it should be probably designed for a right-handed p person . <EOS>
huh . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> kinda like old cars , uh <EOS> yeah . <EOS> let's put it all together . <EOS> swords . <EOS> those kind of <EOS> yeah , those kind of things . <EOS> so you see the big difference <EOS> between the young people ? fresh , exciting . <EOS> and the old people , old and boring . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> you just need the nought . <EOS> sorry . <EOS> i was in charge of the numbers . <EOS> no problem . <EOS> ah . <EOS> and this is just if you've got like eleven or twelve or thirt the plus . <EOS> you can go one , three or something . <EOS> you press that first and then you go one three <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
um we can do it separately and then discuss it <EOS> if if that's what people wanna do . <EOS> yeah okay . <EOS> so it's actually a scale . <EOS> wait , one is true and <EOS> so these are the questions we're answering . <EOS> and one is <EOS>
yeah , <EOS> remember <EOS> the user is not happy to read the <EOS> yeah , <EOS> i think the <EOS> the manuals . manual . <EOS> it's <EOS> no <EOS> you you can have a switch menu , <EOS> so you can <EOS> yeah , <EOS> but it has to be intuitive . <EOS>
'kay . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> okay . <EOS> uh that concludes the presentation of everyone . <EOS> and what we really have to decide in this meeting is um the concept of the remote . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> and uh so what do we think on the concept <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> that's true . <EOS> mm . <EOS> but if we do go with the , with the speech recognition , then it , then our scale goes up quite a bit i think . <EOS> mm . <EOS> oh yeah . <EOS> you probably <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
not sure how far ahead of schedule we were there . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> and yeah adding of a speech interface is always good for a t_v_ remote <EOS> but the technology we already know that as discussed earlier <EOS> well i i think it will be a , yes , a bit complicated to um make a speech recognisers runs on the small uh ts <EOS>
what ? <EOS> i think we did pretty well . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i think we did pretty well too . <EOS> that looks pretty spectacular . <EOS> no , i think we come up with a with a attractive marketable um product and and concept . <EOS> any other chang uh thoughts ? <EOS> okay so th th what about um room for creativity ? <EOS>
m come in at sixteen ? <EOS> a bit over budget , um . <EOS> oh . huh , <EOS> doesn't match up <EOS> does it ? <EOS> so <EOS> what we could do perhaps , a simple fix would maybe to switch away from the solar cells <EOS> um or take out the back-up battery . uh <EOS>
's quite it's quite easy we do that w with back light on the on the wheel . <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> even if i l_e_d_ uh or a if if it's the l_c_d_ feature uh <EOS> whatever , yeah . <EOS> a blue a blue l_e_d_ and we sell that um . <EOS>
how do you mean ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> uh they they don't determine the colour that much , i think . <EOS> okay . yeah <EOS> i i was think about a red uh red leds and blue leds and <EOS> 'cause you have to print on them you have a background . <EOS> each number is transparent . <EOS>
i'm not quite sure how it would work <EOS> and then i wonder if it's if it's more just a gimmick then anything else . <EOS> uh i mean <EOS> ho how many times do you really , seriously lose your remote control <EOS> and would would a device like that actually help you to find it ? <EOS>
mm uh , <EOS> twenty five euros , i think we can make it . <EOS> bec <EOS> uh i th <EOS> twelve and a half , okay . <EOS> but but we only have to make it for television , <EOS> and um we must have something special . <EOS> so <EOS>
okay . <EOS> to just keep it simple and standard uh features . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> w wouldn't it be a problem to uh because you h have to be fast enough . <EOS> maybe the elderly people <EOS> uh yeah mayb <EOS> but i think that's in the t_v_ as well . that's how the uh the t_v_ t_v_ handles it . <EOS> but you can have a button that says um <EOS>
okay , that's me . <EOS> okay , um i have to go again . <EOS> it going ? <EOS> hopefully that should be it this time . <EOS> okay , i think we're there . <EOS> that's good . <EOS> okay , um <EOS> okay i'm gonna be looking at the working design . <EOS> um of the of the remote control . <EOS> um i've just got three sections , <EOS> first is the research i made on the on the remote control itself um . <EOS> and then that involves the components required in it and the systems uh design of the actual the actual remote . <EOS> um so having researched the existing models within the market , um i found my research off the internet .
yeah . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> and then we have different languages . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> that should be uh anything matters . <EOS> that's not so difficult at all , <EOS> because i already use on several voice operated systems , <EOS> and they are all possible to uh not all , but <EOS>
we can give it a one , <EOS> because compared to every other remote ever m ever made , this one will be easier to find . <EOS> okay . um <EOS> yeah , totally . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> sorry heather . <EOS> that wasn't very clear . <EOS> no problem , mm . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> do you not think that defeats the object of having voice recognition on a remote control though ? <EOS> so that you can yell at it , <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , you know , so you have to have the remote control . <EOS> it's more like if you lost it and it's down the sofa sometime , you can yell at it and it'll just change it , you can look for it later , yeah . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> s <EOS> th the the speech recognition um option is it doesn't seem really very promising for us uh , <EOS> 'cause uh <EOS> yeah . <EOS> it's not something that we wanna t go into with this product . <EOS> the yeah the example that they're already using it for is with the coffee machine , <EOS> where , basically , you can program a sample wi um that when you say something it will give a response , <EOS> and you program the response as well . <EOS> just uh clips of tha that you record yourself . <EOS> so you can program your coffee-maker that when you say , good morning , to it it says , hello rick , or whatever . <EOS> but , i mean , it's not <EOS> it would be one thing if it was speech recognition where you say something and it turns the t_v_ on like , turn the t_v_ on , and i turns comes on , <EOS> but it's not that . <EOS> it just gives you <EOS> a it just gives you a verbal response . <EOS> so , yeah , i mean , like what's the point of saying , hello remote , i mean , hello , how how are you ? <EOS> yeah , if you're really lonely , it is it's <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> it's is uh <EOS> lame , <EOS> or <EOS> no <EOS> yeah , <EOS> because now everybody has internet at home , <EOS> so it's better to use internet then teletext . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so , <EOS> you will have to think about it in your in in the design of your remote control , <EOS> and also the remote control will only be used for television , <EOS> so <EOS>
so <EOS> i would make it two . <EOS> also two ? <EOS> not a seven for this ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> uh a two . sure , two . <EOS> oh . <EOS> three ? <EOS> i'd say three . <EOS> i would also say three . <EOS> oh . <EOS> you ? <EOS>
mm . <EOS> like a covering . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> the we can have the fruits and vegetables on the spongy parts , so they can remove it . <EOS> so you <EOS> as the the possibility of having a a graphical display on it , like a screen ? <EOS> like the ipod ? <EOS>
okay . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> we should make a big sponge lemon , <EOS> and then it'd be it would be yellow . <EOS> it's <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> th that's very good . <EOS> glow-in-the-dark . <EOS> okay . <EOS> and people uh <EOS> the f feel of the material is expected to be spongy rather than just having a plastic look , hard look . <EOS> yeah . yeah . <EOS> so so that they could play with it while handi uh while handling it . <EOS> so that should also be taken into consideration . <EOS> so these are my views . <EOS> so <EOS>
oh okay yes <EOS> that is <EOS> yeah . <EOS> it might <EOS> and we might be able to do both <EOS> but it might clash with certain things . <EOS> well not necessarily , <EOS> because you could have your company uh <EOS> we're we're meant to be finishing up . <EOS> you could have your company badge and logo . <EOS> i mean a lot of um computers for instance like like on the one you've got there , it actually has a sort of um stick on badge <EOS> so what you would al all you would really need , whether it , you know , whether the casing be w any colour , could be any colour , but that badge would then have to stick out on top of it <EOS> so that uh in a sense , with a with a logo like that , because it's on a white background , the only colour that it might not stick out so well on would be a white casing . <EOS>
well so this is in the next slide certainly . <EOS> uh no no , it's not . <EOS> it's <EOS> it's not ? <EOS> so which fruit are you thinking of ? <EOS> and <EOS> um . <EOS> i ha i haven't thought of any particular fruit , <EOS> but the general aspect of the of the remote control may may could remind some kind of vegetable , <EOS> some kind of <EOS> instead of vegetable , some natur mm uh natural object or something . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> that certainly does . <EOS> so all the , i mean the important keys are right at your f f you know right at uh at a convenient place for you to to access them . <EOS> so you don't you <EOS> mm . <EOS> which is ant anti-r_s_i_ . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> but it's not uh impossible to use it , if you're left handed . so y because you can use your thumb then . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> just just one thing now . <EOS> um y you need to have more uh one two th <EOS> you've got one two three four five six seven eight nine . <EOS> but you missed the no uh the zero and uh the two stripes . <EOS>
uh l_c_d_ screen as in uh touch screen ? <EOS> yeah , touch screen , yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> the last but not least , younger people are more critical about the features . <EOS> because they use the remote control often more often , <EOS> and are more technical than the ol older people . <EOS> and the older people spend more money , and easily on a remote control . <EOS> so we have to keep in mind to to focus not a lot not that much on the younger pep younger people , <EOS> but also somewhat on the elderly people . <EOS> and on my personal preferences , i don't have any mo more time to come with that , <EOS> but like i said , l_c_d_ screen is easily to use <EOS> because you have you can implement a lot of buttons in one remote with not that much buttons . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> so you've you've had to meet with the marketing team and how they're going to market and what are the marketing strategic plan , okay , <EOS> when are you going to introduce , okay , and by the time you introduce the product and uh you know there there would be a competition , <EOS> okay , so i need some kind of uh uh the plan in the writing from you . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> and our our current customers are mainly forty plus <EOS> uh which <EOS> well <EOS> forty . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> fourteen <EOS> or for o <EOS> okay . <EOS> so <EOS> so <EOS> that's to that's <EOS> i mean there's a market <EOS> but uh they will grow older older <EOS> and you'll al always need to have the the future with younger people . <EOS> um therefore , <EOS>
mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> mm mm-hmm . <EOS> what features . <EOS> s sellable . yes . <EOS> yes . <EOS> so i'll be coming to you for how much is it gonna cost us and how long is it gonna take you , <EOS> and i'll be coming to you to tell me what's gonna make somebody take out their wallet you know , <EOS> what what's what's gonna really be what they call a sizzle , <EOS> 'cause we gotta sell this sizzle . <EOS> a lot of times the thing that works the best from an engineering point of view isn't the thing that somebody's really just gonna take out their wallet and buy for christmas for for their child or for their husband or whatever . <EOS>
yes . giraffe . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> okay . <EOS> could you write the words , uh underneath it ? <EOS> anything else you need to know ? <EOS> oh , <EOS> uh <EOS> or more words . <EOS> tall . <EOS> tall . <EOS> so , <EOS> 'kay . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> ovals . <EOS> yeah , yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay , let's talk about all of our <EOS> we'll come to decision later about all the components that we need to include , <EOS> let's um wrap up this one , <EOS> and i'm gonna go back to my powerpoint , <EOS> 'cause we need to discuss the new project requirements <EOS> which you might've already seen flashed up on the screen a bit earlier . <EOS> wait , come back . <EOS> alright . <EOS> sorry , <EOS> let's go through this . <EOS> alright . <EOS> here we go . <EOS> new product requirements . <EOS> first it's only going to be a t_v_ remote . <EOS> we're trying not to over-complicate things . <EOS> so no d_v_d_ , no tivo , no stereo . <EOS> it's not gonna be multi-functional . <EOS>
uh it's a standard module so you should get it for a cheap price uh . <EOS> it's that same charger that you can use for the hand-phone <EOS> but uh again depends on the types . <EOS> i think we have to investigate more on that , but <EOS> thank thank you . <EOS> and so mm-hmm . <EOS>
yes , indeed . on the other one . okay . so . <EOS> two and three , <EOS> or one and two ? <EOS> yes . yeah , it's one . <EOS> say , say one and two . one and two . mm-hmm . <EOS> okay . <EOS> so le le let's see . <EOS> so <EOS> d <EOS> this one has spongy but buttons ? <EOS>
okay , so i'll go back , maybe , to the previous slide <EOS> and we can decide for each problem , what we should choose . <EOS> so for the energy source , do we go for the battery or the <EOS> 'kay . <EOS> yeah , i'm fine with the basic battery . <EOS>
scheduling . <EOS> um to find out what what you're watching even if there's commercials you know . <EOS> yeah <EOS> and now you can c look it over internet . <EOS> but i still think teletext is way more convenient until until we have the same commodities . <EOS> okay . <EOS>
do you wanna anything ? <EOS> i dunno if the the <EOS> ah . <EOS> uh yeah . <EOS> well i had the cat as well , but uh i've got a spare one . <EOS> i think the pen is running out of <EOS> so i'll use the spare one . <EOS> um but it's harder to draw um . <EOS>
anyone a mathematician ? <EOS> two million . <EOS> four million . <EOS> and it <EOS> well it's the profit so if a profit for each is twelve fifty , that'll do four million . <EOS> oh , yeah . <EOS> it is a lot . uh . <EOS> so f that's a fifty percent um uh . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> i think <EOS> yeah , yeah . yeah . <EOS> case . <EOS> later ? <EOS> so you think case . <EOS> something spongy . <EOS> someth no wood . <EOS> no wood <EOS> but plastic ? <EOS> maybe not no wood , <EOS> but i mean ma maybe not the part you touching you know . <EOS>
you should go for the next one it seems to me . <EOS> w well , <EOS> this uh this tool seemed to work . <EOS> let's continue to uh to the real stuff . <EOS> yeah , exactly , yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> wow . <EOS> um our project uh finance uh thing . <EOS> uh when we are and when w you are uh going to design w uh we must keep in mind that the selling price of the product uh will be about twenty five euros , <EOS> so when designing a project uh i also look at you uh mael , keep in mind uh uh uh people uh <EOS>
right , okay um . <EOS> that also goes back to the original design when we saw those two , <EOS> and there was the one on the left hand side which had all like the double functions and stuff <EOS> which kind of looked too busy and had too much on it , so . <EOS>
although , if <EOS> it depends , if we like , if we are concentrating on like a fruit design , then maybe maybe we wanna sell a collection of fruit , you know , like a different fruit for each device . <EOS> cause that , you know , that sometimes people like to collect um you know things that of a similar type . <EOS>
but um deaf people need uh teletext for uh for subtitles . <EOS> so it's <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , also . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so <EOS> i suggest uh <EOS> i think it'd definitely be a bad idea not to include teletext . <EOS> it's <EOS> mm . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> that's true . <EOS> yep . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah something more modern to go <EOS> a a modern colour to go with the modern form . <EOS> right . <EOS> right . <EOS> it's different . <EOS> you don't want your uh three feet huge l_c_d_ dis display in your living room that's hanging from the wall to be controlled with something like that . <EOS>
oh okay . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , that's gonna be what's communicating with the t_v_ , <EOS> but the other bulb , i think , is good to just to indicate , i'm doing something , it's sort of like a reassurance . <EOS> the l the light up kind of <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
uh below i believe . <EOS> yeah below forty . <EOS> the new product ? <EOS> or below <EOS> because that's pretty relevant . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> i thought i read a <EOS> our current customers are in the age group forty plus . <EOS> and the new product should reach new markets , which is the customers below forty . <EOS>
we are we're talking about um the type of company that we're working for as well . <EOS> that they want um it to be fashionable , <EOS> they want it to be trendy <EOS> and you wouldn't automatically assume associate that with the older generations . <EOS> now with the baby boomers , the older generations are actually larger , <EOS> they have a greater population than us young people , <EOS> but i don't think we're focusing on that , <EOS>
for the volume . <EOS> um well <EOS> that could <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah <EOS> we could do that <EOS> but i'm not sure if that would be very good for the easy , ease of use . <EOS> usabili <EOS> yeah ease of use will be a lot more difficult , <EOS> and then it's <EOS>
no , i don't need don't need <EOS> uh teletext options are only four buttons or something . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> but younger people i think um more often use the internet <EOS> and elderly people often use teletext . <EOS> so uh <EOS> yeah , that's right . <EOS>
i say five . <EOS> you say ? <EOS> i change the question . <EOS> so what's the new question ? <EOS> and you have saved it ? <EOS> so yeah upload the <EOS> you'll have to reload . <EOS> uh yeah , i think so . <EOS> okay , so , it depends if uh <EOS>
yeah ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> i think . <EOS> so red buttons are okay ? <EOS> i think so . <EOS> okay . <EOS> that that's a default uh setting . the the red buttons . <EOS> you can make them red . <EOS> yeah . but i think you need to keep in mind that the leds are just extra light . <EOS>
'kay . <EOS> okay , so is everyone happy with that ? <EOS> ah yes yes , that seems good . <EOS> okay . <EOS> i'm gonna pull this off . <EOS> i think if you just give it a second to maybe catch up . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> i think she said twenty seconds to um <EOS>
it's what paul says . <EOS> it's not a remote control uh uh that um uh makes the t_v_ um do one two . <EOS> it's the t_v_ who depends that it must be two seconds or three seconds or one second that you must uh type one or two . <EOS>
right . <EOS> night . <EOS> mm , but then it would be charging through the day , <EOS> i think the point is that it charges through the day and then you've got it charged for the evening . <EOS> but i i think i think the the next one's the best anyway . <EOS> the the kinetic charging which is like you get it in r you get it in wrist watches <EOS> and you d you don't even notice it . <EOS> i mean the amount the amount of probably moving around you'd be doing all the time would would charge it up , <EOS> i don't think you'd ever need to actually physically start shaking it up to make it work . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> and the second thing , f second point from me would be that in a normal remote control there is uh there are two buttons for volume control . <EOS> but i prefer like a potential-meter or something like . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> ah , okay . okay . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> the fruit ? yeah . <EOS> maybe <EOS> yeah , maybe la next year it will be insects . <EOS> yeah , it's <EOS> yeah . <EOS> but i think it's good to follow the f flow and you know make it now and after , you know , if the people change their mind you change also the product . <EOS>
yep . <EOS> so call it the snowman-shape trademark . <EOS> yeah that's cool . <EOS> um and i mean colour-wise what does everybody think ? <EOS> i think it is quite important to get yellow in there somewhere . <EOS> i mean do you want the whole thing yellow , <EOS> maybe like yellow and white <EOS> do you want something <EOS>
okay , <EOS> we have to stop it now . <EOS> so just <EOS> okay , <EOS> that's a r that's that's a advanced <EOS> but i it's a separate chip . <EOS> i dunno , <EOS> but if we use speech recognition , that will be in it as well . <EOS>
ah okay . <EOS> so you don't have to search for your television or your code . <EOS> it uh search uh the pattern for itself . <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay , yeah . <EOS> so <EOS> it uh <EOS> we have to make a a s a bit more intelligent chip than the standard one . <EOS> because you have to <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
mm 'kay . <EOS> but then , that's complicated . <EOS> i wanna thank you all for all your presentations . <EOS> we have about ten minutes left , <EOS> in which time we have to make some decisions on the remote control concepts . <EOS> um and i think you all have been self-stimulating of working together . <EOS> um we need to come up with some specifics of the components , um the materials , things like making the decision on the energy um and the case and the interface type things . <EOS> so <EOS> let's <EOS> mm . right . <EOS>
help me . <EOS> what exactly is a smart chip ? <EOS> usually a smart chip is just a chip that's been programmed and designed so that it can complete a fair range of functions . <EOS> well , how much extra would the additional chip be ? <EOS> is that gonna push us over our production costs ? <EOS>
but the yellow , i mean it could be a lemon yellow colour , <EOS> couldn't it ? <EOS> right . yeah , could be . yeah . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> the the yellow is more representative of the colour , <EOS> but the button itself , the blue can be anything else . <EOS>
oh no , . <EOS> sorry <EOS> it's okay . <EOS> sorry . <EOS> we'll get um warnings for next meetings as well . <EOS> okay . <EOS> i shall <EOS> i can't imagine these are worth much . <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay , cool . <EOS> hmm . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> it's not new , <EOS> it's not innovative , <EOS> it's <EOS> you know , <EOS> everybody does long remote <EOS> because it's easy , <EOS> it's it's stable um . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> 'kay , <EOS> i'll draw something . <EOS> what ? <EOS> my idea was just to have it be kind of like a <EOS>
sorry ? <EOS> what kind of task was it ? <EOS> it was a t_v_ ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> uh most for most is t_v_ . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah <EOS> but in fact we it it seems that we are going to make a t_v_ remote control according to new requirements i received from the management <EOS> bo i will present them in the following . <EOS> okay . <EOS>
is it possible to have it to where it would work with a like a sensor on either side ? <EOS> so that either way you're pointing it it would work . <EOS> i suppose you could do that . <EOS> o of course the more technology you stick in that , the more it'll cost , so . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> sorted . <EOS> we will omit the touch screen in favour of voice recognition . <EOS> it's you and me outside a little here . <EOS> are we going to talk now about um the materials that we're gonna use for the case and all those things ? <EOS> okay . <EOS>
very easy to use . do you think it's easy to use ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , i think so . yeah . <EOS> i would give a i would give a seven as well . <EOS> it's very easy to use . <EOS> i give a seven , i think . <EOS>
the batteries are going in the back ? <EOS> that <EOS> everyone gave that a one or a two . <EOS> yeah they'd probably be either on the front or the side of the remote . <EOS> no . <EOS> the reason i i ga i didn't give it a one <EOS> i think i gave it a three because i thought you'd have to like unc clip <EOS> no you could <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> but do they <EOS> but the t_v_s are often kind of someone's old t_v_ that's blah blah <EOS> and be a bit strange to have a fancy rome remote . <EOS> common , <EOS> the students <EOS> yeah , yeah . <EOS> the s the stu <EOS> yeah , and the remote control might not <EOS> yeah , <EOS> it might not even function with the old t_v_ . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> yeah yeah . <EOS> more complicated design that rav uh sorry raj um <EOS> said people didn't like . <EOS> although i guess if there's a sort of <EOS> if you think about standard interfaces that people use already , sort of windows-style drop down menus or whatever , <EOS> i think maybe that's a bit , going a bit far <EOS> but you know like in a basic sense that you could have your basic selection of buttons , <EOS> and if you hit a sort of menu at the top you have <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> but i if design if design is cheap and functionality is basic , then twenty-five euros is probably a high price for a commoner garden stan standard t_v_ <EOS> so the place uh remote the <EOS> then the place we're going to justify that cost is through through design through making it a a sleek elegant high-priced basic remote . <EOS> does that make sense , huh ? <EOS>
yes . <EOS> yes . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> um , and then <EOS> i guess build the plan based on all of that , <EOS> because i think you need to take all the factors into account . <EOS> yep . <EOS> but what i request , okay , keep ed in the loop , okay , in between your uh meeting and christine meeting , because uh he should know what's happening . <EOS>
yeah . mm . <EOS> yep . <EOS> is is the price , okay . <EOS> my m my supervisor will be glad that it's fifty cents cheaper than he expected . <EOS> okay . well <EOS> that's that's <EOS> yep . <EOS> actually yeah , we we we will not need the really uh expert designers um because the amount , yeah . <EOS>
the costs , was that what you said ? <EOS> play-doh is very cheap . <EOS> well , yeah . <EOS> mm . <EOS> um <EOS> play-doh won't last very long <EOS> everybody'll go like , oops , it's gone . <EOS> but it's edible . <EOS> mm-hmm . mm-hmm . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> well you know there's the old motto , children under six never shop alone . <EOS> so if you've designed something that's very attractive to children um the mummy please mummy please um you know we want it now we wanna go to the store and see it um that has uh a lot of marketing pull . <EOS>
i think <EOS> spongy , uh , that means that it goes in in the water . mm-hmm . <EOS> well , <EOS> the spongy could be part of the the feel of the buttons as well , <EOS> i know some <EOS> have you tried the mobile phones that have got the kinda spongy buttons <EOS> and <EOS> not not exactly spongy <EOS> but i'm thinking one of the nokias that's got like you ca it hasn't got individual buttons <EOS> it's got just a one bit on it <EOS> and so you can <EOS> that feels kinda spongy . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> to go for the the manufacturers . okay . um the other thing that we're supposed to do is make decision on our functions . <EOS> our functions , we've so far decided , i think , that power , channel , volume make it attractive . <EOS> um it has to have an enter key and of course the number keys . <EOS> it has to have big user-friendly buttons <EOS> and sh n definitely we wanna be inspired <EOS> that the current styles are just plain awful . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> you could do , <EOS> although the broccoli is quite comfortable , i have to say , <EOS> like sorta like a joystick . <EOS> yeah that i i when you were holding that before , it actually looked yeah . <EOS> yeah . that looked really good . <EOS>
that went well , <EOS> thank you . <EOS> 'kay . <EOS> that's great . <EOS> perfect . <EOS> alright , <EOS> let me just powerpoint this up . <EOS> right so um <EOS> this meeting will be about the conceptual design , <EOS> don't ask me s precisely what conceptual design is , <EOS> it's just something important that we need to do . <EOS> um , think of it 's kind of uh turning the abstract into slightly more concrete . <EOS> in this meeting ideally we'll come to some final decisions on what we're gonna do for the prototype . <EOS> um . right so um , <EOS> apologies for the last meeting , <EOS> it was brought to my attention that i did not make the roles clear enough , <EOS> um , so i will attempt to do so more accurately in this particular meeting . <EOS> um , fair enough , <EOS> thanks for the input , <EOS> 's always good . um . <EOS> so , <EOS> basically all we're gonna do is have some presentations again much like last time , <EOS> um , and gonna go through you , <EOS> uh whoever wants to go first is f fine by me <EOS> um and we'll collate what we know about um what we discussed in the last meeting , possible directions . <EOS> and then we'll make some more decisions on um basic <EOS> uh firm up our idea on how we want this remote control to look and work . <EOS> so , <EOS> perfect . <EOS>
i dunno i think we had a fair bit of creativity . <EOS> oh yeah it's really creative . <EOS> and uh but i think one thing we m missed out of this whole process was a um like a focus group with the actual people we're targeting . <EOS> we needed some of these kind of young trendsetters to come in and play with the banana and you know see if they <EOS>
these would be like the rubber , the rubber grips . <EOS> so that's <EOS> so that would hopefully help with grip , or like the ergonomics of it . <EOS> um but all the controlling would be done with this scroll wheel . <EOS> you have to use your imagination a little bit . <EOS> and this here represents the screen , where you , where you'd go through . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> it's very curvy , <EOS> so okay . <EOS> yeah <EOS> i never did get a picture of those <EOS> so i don't really know . <EOS> our case material supplements <EOS> oops , <EOS> we just skipped by them . <EOS> no , <EOS> we we the plastic is the plastic for the inside is assumed . <EOS> the supplement is <EOS>
um so i think we need two basic functions which is just the basic remote functions , <EOS> the user can input a channel or volume setting and it will be output to the t_v_ . <EOS> and also we talked about um a location function where maybe you could press a button on the t_v_ and it would send sort of signal to the remote where it would beep or flash or vibrate or whatever to tell you where the remote is . <EOS> so the components we need are an energy source to power the remote , <EOS> um input which would probably be buttons , <EOS> although um we just talked about voice recognition , <EOS> processor to take the information , <EOS> um something to transmit it to the t_v_ , <EOS> and we also need something on the remote that would receive the location signal and have an output , like possibly a beep or a vibration . <EOS> and also you need a sender for location signal , <EOS> which would probably be a separate um thing that we'd have to sell with the remote and people could stick it on their t_v_ or stick it on their wall . <EOS> and this is just sort of an overview of how the remote works . <EOS> power comes from the battery , goes to the chip , <EOS> um and then it is sent from there to an infrared bulb <EOS> which is probably the easiest way to send to the t_v_ . <EOS> and then for the location function , you would have a sender on the t_v_ which would output some sort of signal , <EOS> um we could use i_r_ but we'd probably wanna use radio instead . <EOS> that signal would go to a receiver which it would process it , <EOS> and it would be output in the form of a buzzer or a light lighting up . <EOS> um so my personal preferences for how to build the remote would probably be uh , battery for the energy source , <EOS> that way you wouldn't have to plug it in , <EOS> um a button pad for input , <EOS> um we can purchase a pre-made chip which will handle all the processing stuff , <EOS> i_r_ transmitter to communicate to the t_v_ , <EOS> that's just sort of standard , um so most t_v_s have an i_r_ receiver . <EOS> probably a radio receiver to send out location function and to receive it <EOS> and i'd probably say a buzzer for the location function on the remote itself . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> yep . <EOS> manuel you're going to work on the components for for what we're gonna use . <EOS> let's go with our our uh rounded <EOS> right . <EOS> kind of fit in your hand <EOS> let's explore uh the the uh possibility of having the two-piece . <EOS> so one for the the quick zapping um and possibly one you know with just that rounded part that fits into your hand . um <EOS>
any more points to discuss ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i think we can go ahead with what we have . <EOS> i will summarise the things we discussed <EOS> and put it in the project folder . <EOS> uh the use of the industrial designer can work on the working design , etcetera etcetera . <EOS> and it seems you get more information by email . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> hello everyone . <EOS> hi . <EOS> hi . <EOS> hi . <EOS> um how uh how we doing ? <EOS> yeah , good . <EOS> uh first we going uh over the minutes of the last meeting , more or less . <EOS> um in the last meeting uh the marketing manager had presented uh her method of working , <EOS> meaning gathering i suggestions <EOS>
okay . <EOS> so , i hope you can do that in thirty minutes . <EOS> and uh , yeah , i <EOS> uh i think you should work together , s you uh hamed and peter , to work uh in a in a first prototype , <EOS> and uh more about the shape and so on <EOS> and how you can manage to put everything together . <EOS> and um as usual you will receive some specific instructions on . <EOS> so thank you all everybody , <EOS> and see you in thirty minutes . <EOS>
all of the components have been used in other things before . <EOS> but do <EOS> yeah , yeah . <EOS> but at the same time they are all they are all relatively new . <EOS> yeah , but they've been brought together in a remote . <EOS> they're never been used i they've never been using remote remote control before i don't think . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> mm . <EOS> i i mean it its uh i that's an interesting idea , <EOS> it's like the old swatch watch <EOS> where uh um on only batteries ever got changed in those , <EOS> 'cause people just bought a new one when it went out of fashion , <EOS> but it's just never been seen as a a fashion item before . <EOS> um that's <EOS> yes if if if they're made in sufficient quantity <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> and per perhaps uh <EOS> no . <EOS> well uh uh <EOS> yes yes s sh <EOS> a button where you can uh change from one number to two numbers . <EOS> can you <EOS> don't know if that's got a name , <EOS> but <EOS> two s two <EOS> two digits , <EOS> oh okay . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> so , <EOS> second point is they still want it it to be technologically innovative , <EOS> so maybe it's sort of related to what you've said with the speech recognition and so on . <EOS> okay . <EOS> at the same time , it's important that it's easy to use . <EOS> so <EOS> that were the three first points from the remote control uh analysis . <EOS> now i if we look at fashion in general um <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> but it's only a half . <EOS> but i think the only option is to drop the uh sample speaker . <EOS> yeah . sample speaker . <EOS> to knock the sample speaker , yeah . <EOS> and sample sensor . <EOS> th then we still have too much <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> so you can open uh <EOS> three . <EOS> participant <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so <EOS> so i'm working on the technical functions design . <EOS> can you show the next slide . <EOS> during the weekend . <EOS> that's good . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> g <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah to s th well it's it's not as expensive as it would be if it was full colour 'cause if we've just got a black and white one , <EOS> i mean they use them in calculators so . <EOS> hmm . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> more like a traditional remote control . <EOS> um . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> i mean it's already got a kind of cool shape , <EOS> so but it wouldn't have to be curved sort of in and out . <EOS> and by doing so <EOS> oh no , hold on . <EOS> doesn't save us quite as much . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm . i well <EOS> i think many people said uh in your in in your research uh uh mm . <EOS> uh the appearance of the uh r_c_ is is important when they are buying one but <EOS> yeah . <EOS> but why are they buying one in the first place ? <EOS>
oh yeah , yeah . <EOS> yeah , so you can capture s voice from different directions . yeah . <EOS> and i think you you've never seen a rou a round remote control , so it is <EOS> yeah bu but when you say technologically it's more uh i dunno , in the core , or single . <EOS>
yeah , what it just needs to be as long as it's sort of self-intuitive and you can can work out what everything's doing , 'cause i mean , menus on sort of new phones now they've sort of got all these pictures and stuff which makes it fairly obvious what you're trying to do . <EOS>
what an original idea . <EOS> do you have any idea of which animal you want to show us ? <EOS> orangutan . <EOS> okay that's good . <EOS> n n <EOS> no no n <EOS> can i give you the <EOS> no ? <EOS> but i don't have to say anything . when i'm drawing the orangutan . <EOS>
anyway . so <EOS> i'm gonna turn over to the industrial designer uh to go ahead and make a presentation <EOS> on <EOS> okay . <EOS> so do i unplug this bit here ? <EOS> gotta plug you in . <EOS> oh , <EOS> right yeah . <EOS> yep . <EOS> might have to hit function f_ eight <EOS> but it looks like it's gonna come up . <EOS> yep . cool . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> maybe we could have that pale yellow and then an outside bit bright yellow with , you said , the logan the slogan . <EOS> colour , but have <EOS> kinda going round , yeah . <EOS> mm . <EOS>
oh . <EOS> i would say two . <EOS> yeah . two . <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay , so our average there , five , six , eight , ten , eleven , twelve , thirteen , fifteen , nineteen , twenty one , divided by eleven <EOS> it's <EOS>
but it shouldn't be under the flip either , <EOS> because you can have the remote control closed , but you still might want to activate it by voice . <EOS> uh it's it's <EOS> yeah , but uh uh <EOS> my opinion i think it's better under the flip <EOS> because whenever you want to uh the talk , okay , so then you can speak then you can close it . <EOS> but if you put it on the on the flip , okay , then uh technical i don't think it's uh feasible , <EOS> 'cause most of the time you speak then it will be recognised . <EOS>
right . <EOS> so we've got ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen there ? <EOS> um . <EOS> channel up and down . <EOS> what else have we got ? <EOS> what was that , sixteen ? <EOS> numbers is ten , <EOS> volume is twelve , <EOS> th yeah si <EOS> one up , one down . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> no the point was to try to , well , just talk to them , to david , or <EOS> we're gonna have to . <EOS> yeah , b why why couldn't we do like couldn't we do it like for for the the set-up of meetings . <EOS> you you <EOS> everyone received that and uh should provide yeah , i would like to be here . <EOS> and then you will have this multi-constraint problem <EOS> and uh you work during two hours and you come up with the optimal solution . <EOS>
mm . har how it works an <EOS> and in marketing <EOS> these are requirement specification . <EOS> bu <EOS> user requirements specifications . <EOS> so what the user requires <EOS> yeah , <EOS> what <EOS> do you think our two kind of overlap , because <EOS> in a remote . <EOS>
uh okay . mm . <EOS> yeah i know . <EOS> but this one includes this feature , right ? spongy buttons . yeah . we we we we we yeah , it's the way they are going to be , actually . <EOS> so it's sort of , yeah . <EOS> mm . okay . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i mean definitely the area round it . <EOS> yeah i think it could work . <EOS> or what if we integrated the the uh the f what if the whole thing about the fruit and vegetables <EOS> we somehow made it tactilely fash you know , we c tapped into that , so like it feels like <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> okay . <EOS> mm-hmm , <EOS> that's the next one along , yeah ? <EOS> yeah , <EOS> so what the graph shows is that , you know , power , channel selection and volume selection are important , <EOS> and the rest of them , you know , nobody really uses <EOS> and so that's the the numbers along the top represent their like um their importance , you know , <EOS> so on a scale of one to ten , how important is that <EOS> and , you know , channel selection and volume selection are absolutely essential , <EOS> and the power , well it's not quite so essential , apparently , <EOS> although i don't understand how it couldn't be , <EOS> um and everything else , i think , you know , you can forget about having those buttons on the remote control , <EOS> 'cause they're just not needed , <EOS> and they're not used . <EOS>
flap <EOS> yeah . <EOS> right . <EOS> yeah , okay , that's possible , <EOS> but it'll get very big the the remote control . <EOS> that's possible , <EOS> so that you only get the <EOS> no n n no , <EOS> just <EOS> uh for example you got th uh the same size uh remote control you use everyday , <EOS> but um the usual buttons such as uh um zapping uh as you call it in dutch . uh and the volume control uh are only the only possible buttons uh to use directly . <EOS> or uh the numbers , of course . <EOS> but uh not uh the buttons used to search on the the channels on your television . <EOS> you only use those uh the first time , <EOS> or . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> change the cases . yeah . <EOS> maybe it's possible uh possibility . <EOS> so um um <EOS> you have just to make one um standard um remote control , <EOS> and um yeah you can sell uh few uh <EOS> yeah . <EOS> you can sell the cases . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i think that's a very good option . <EOS> because um then you can advertise as well <EOS> with the <EOS> give your grandfather a new case for his remote control , or whatever . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm . <EOS> uh furthermore we go for the for the uh basic plastic case which can be later uh fancied up with uh with addit uh additional uh , how do you call them , these like like mobile telephones you can put a cover over it . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> that's basically uh how it works . <EOS> um the findings uh uh that i found uh searching up some uh detailed information about the remote controls , are that uh they are very easy to produce , <EOS> uh it is pis <EOS> uh it's possible to uh make them in mass production <EOS> because it is as eas it is as easy as uh printing a page , <EOS> uh just uh fibreglass plate um is b uh is uh covered with uh some uh coatings and uh uh and chips . <EOS> uh and the technology's already available , <EOS> we don't have to find out how remote controls uh have to work <EOS> or uh how that how uh to make some chips that are possible to uh to to transmit those uh signals . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> that's , that's <EOS> yeah , it is . yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> alright . <EOS> anything about , um , the look of the , uh , remote control that you might have ideas about . <EOS> maybe it could be , instead of like a standard rectangular shape , it could be , um , something more interesting like <EOS>
yeah , <EOS> who knows . <EOS> it's kinda frustrating , <EOS> but um <EOS> be sure to note any frustrations or any um issues that come up in your um in your um summary . <EOS> okay <EOS> mm 'kay ? <EOS> sounds good . <EOS> great seeing y'all . <EOS>
very good . <EOS> and as you already know i am betty . <EOS> i am the project manager for today . <EOS> so why don't we look at the presentation to see what we really are supposed to do . <EOS> okay . <EOS> um . <EOS> yes y opening , acquaintance , tool training <EOS> well , the tools are , i think , we already <EOS> i guess the tool is really our the computer , as far as i can see . <EOS>
bring on the ice sculptures . <EOS> nice . <EOS> and then we get the product launch party . <EOS> product launch party ? <EOS> absolutely . <EOS> so <EOS> we might have to wait . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> that's what i said , ice sculptures . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> add an l_c_d_ screen , add a scroll wheel , that'll be fine . <EOS> or make it just push-buttons . <EOS> basically plastic gives you the b biggest variety of of options . <EOS> maybe not the nicest feel . <EOS> or not much originality really . <EOS>
oh oh oh <EOS> i'll make a note of that , kate . <EOS> good , good comment . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> it might be good to know <EOS> um uh who , you know , who's actually buying televisions <EOS> and are we in a uh uh s yeah . <EOS>
so . <EOS> any further comments ? <EOS> um obviously it's gonna be bulkier than how it looks , <EOS> because it's gonna be flat on one side , <EOS> so the l_c_d_ will be s sticking down like this , <EOS> won't it ? <EOS> 'cause it you can't get it curved . <EOS>
and uh go back button , i don't know really where it is , maybe one of this buttons , <EOS> and um power on and off mm i i don't remember <EOS> so uh <EOS> it it it should be <EOS> maybe this button is power on and off ? <EOS> or no ? <EOS> i can see nothing . <EOS> so <EOS> that's our concept . <EOS> it's called the millennium remote control . <EOS>
we have a <EOS> i guess we have a presentation each , <EOS> 'cause i've got one . um . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> i've got one too . <EOS> i see , right . <EOS> that's nice to know , <EOS> one from each of you . <EOS> um new project requirements . <EOS> um so do we want to do the presentation first , <EOS> or do we want to um <EOS>
yeah okay . <EOS> so <EOS> that's already a very big change <EOS> compared to <EOS> hmm . <EOS> ye yeah . well uh <EOS> yeah , we could do that . <EOS> could . <EOS> uh yeah , <EOS> but uh if you the f uh front , the scroll wheel will still uh be yellow . <EOS>
yeah , but when you're zapping you're changing from one channel to the other , <EOS> so you're passing through all the channels . <EOS> so , when you say i want to go to the channel number twenty that's you've decided to go to channel twenty , <EOS> so you can say channel twenty , or channel four , because you really want to go on this channel . <EOS> but if you really want to to do zapping you you don't really know what you want to do , you can turn it . <EOS> just go through all the channels and maybe stop if there is something interesting ? <EOS>
no , <EOS> it's not gonna be a t no touchable <EOS> but still like a source of information or source for menus . <EOS> ah . <EOS> yeah <EOS> maybe maybe we can see depending on how we'll come up with our full design <EOS> then if we have enough money or like for and <EOS> because the speech recognition technology will take at least five euros or or something <EOS> so we want to reduce the cost on display <EOS> or this inter <EOS>
hmm . <EOS> but um i'm gonna come back to the advantages of titanium , <EOS> and basically it can have a flat surface , a curved surface or a double curved surface , <EOS> but i think if we wanna use standard components , we're gonna have difficulty with anything much beyond that . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> and so in the research that i was doing there's basically two types of remotes , <EOS> ones that are engineering centred and ones that are more user centred , <EOS> which i don't know if i can access the web page from here , <EOS> but i can show you uh . <EOS> yeah . so this is a engineer centred one , <EOS> so you see it's rather busy , <EOS> but it also lets you play your movie , stop your movie , fast-forward , all this , um freeze frame . <EOS> uh and this is a user centred one . <EOS> uh it's it's easier to g just glance at this and see what's possible to do , <EOS> you're not gonna be staring at it for five minutes . <EOS> and i <EOS> judging from what what we all talked about during our last meeting i kind of gathered that that's what we were going after , <EOS> uh or the direction we were going in at least . um . <EOS>
b <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm yeah , yeah , yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> oh yeah , <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i'm just gonna pass this along . <EOS> yes . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm right . <EOS> right . <EOS> here we go . <EOS> uh yeah , this is my report on trend watching . <EOS> the data's come off internet uh from executive summary for us on the top three things wanted by the consumer . <EOS> and we got reports from paris , milan on new fashions . <EOS>
not bad i would say . <EOS> yeah , that's pretty good . <EOS> okay , well , you got it's a s it's a squirrel , <EOS> and i like them , because they're cute and stupid . <EOS> very good . <EOS> ah . <EOS> alright . <EOS> right .
chan <EOS> yeah , okay , <EOS> but don't touch don't destroy your prototype . <EOS> yeah , s <EOS> okay . <EOS> uh the third feature is a stable triangle base . <EOS> uh this sta uh this triangle base is very stable , so <EOS> uh so it's it's um <EOS> it's unlikely you cannot found it . <EOS> so it's v um , you can put it in the table so you can turn the the ball to cha to select the channel <EOS> and there's some cute button . <EOS>
one question , <EOS> uh how late do we have to get back be back here ? <EOS> uh well uh <EOS> thirty minutes . <EOS> a quarter to one maybe ? <EOS> uh , yeah . <EOS> thirty minutes lunch break ? <EOS> thirty minutes lunch break , yeah . <EOS>
of the product ? <EOS> which we don't have yet . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah uh about <EOS> so wh how should i do that ? <EOS> yeah i don't know . <EOS> you probably get a mail . <EOS> oh okay . <EOS> or you you or you send it to me . <EOS> or just <EOS> because you are going to design it on this board right ? <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , yeah , <EOS> like like the ipod idea that that we just saw . <EOS> you just have a f a few selected buttons and uh a few menus , <EOS> and with this idea you could actually make uh several you can also improve uh later on . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . i s i suppose one thing is that b because it's technically innovative , <EOS> um for someone who's sort of technophobic , the fact that it simply looks unfamiliar would be daunting . <EOS> yeah . yeah . <EOS> i think it's totally uh radical to have a remote control with no no numbered buttons , <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
like uh <EOS> uh . <EOS> well it means like , this remote here is kind of is very thin and long so instead of having you know you might have it kind of a bit bigger <EOS> or , you know , with maybe some some finger molds or something . <EOS>
excuse me . <EOS> okay , <EOS> that's . <EOS> and uh we have to make a profit of fifty million euros , <EOS> so we have to uh use a big market in europe . <EOS> piece of cake . <EOS> the production cost are about half the price of selling price , <EOS> sorry . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> not quite . <EOS> did you press f_ eight ? <EOS> it's probably not sending . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> oh something coming now , yeah . <EOS> yep , there it is . <EOS> there we go . <EOS> and so think of this concept . <EOS> um to research it i've um had a look on the the homepage again . <EOS> it's provided me with more examples of um previously existing c remote controls . <EOS> um there's a wee bit of discussion about the other existing ones there , <EOS> um so i've taken the um suggestions from them and tried to incorporate them into this um <EOS> so then this <EOS> we're looking for um suggestions on size th um size of control and the buttons , <EOS> um the shape of the control , <EOS> and whereabout the buttons should be located on the control . <EOS>
good . good . <EOS> yeah , yeah . <EOS> yep . <EOS> okay . so <EOS> then then <EOS> and the other one ? <EOS> wow . <EOS> ah . <EOS> i think it's slightly better , um , <EOS> mm . <EOS> it's hard to tell from just the plasticine , <EOS> but <EOS>
see , a po <EOS> three . we need point three . <EOS> uh it's a colour . <EOS> don't make it wood . <EOS> a colour . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> but a wood <EOS> we can make it brown , dark brown , not wood . <EOS> make it uh <EOS> yeah , <EOS> but it's it's special colour , <EOS> is it <EOS>
how do you wear this thing ? <EOS> hmm . mm mm mm . <EOS> not too many cables and stuff . <EOS> original . <EOS> is recorded ? okay ? <EOS> okay so welcome everyone . <EOS> so we are here for the kickoff meeting of uh the process of designing a new remote control . <EOS> so i will first start with a warm welcome opening stuff , <EOS> then uh we will uh see what will be uh our product and what will be the different step we will have to design it . <EOS>
we should make one that walks by itself . <EOS> although if it's sitting still for too long . <EOS> yes i <EOS> that really could get up and walk away . <EOS> or or like some crazy like electro-magnet , that you push it and it'll go zoom to the t_v_ and stick there . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> i can't see that , <EOS> is that play and stop and things ? <EOS> this is central one , the one you <EOS> yeah volume and channel . <EOS> so keep that m that standardised because that's the most common feature across all models , <EOS> if you look at all the models , it's here . <EOS>
that still stays . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> that's important i think <EOS> and <EOS> l_c_d_ doesn't work for uh twelve and a half euros i think . <EOS> and i d i don't don't think it's very usable in a remote control , <EOS> especially when you only have t_v_ functions on it . <EOS>
yeah exactly . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> and um this one is just pointing out . <EOS> i like some of these things um the the raised symbols and everything , <EOS> but pointing out um that this one the volume it is kind of pressing down , but it would actually go up , because of the shape . <EOS> so that could <EOS> that's a bit confusing . <EOS> um but the buttons on this i think are <EOS> it's just showing you how you can have different different um buttons . <EOS> they don't have to be all the same . <EOS> so that's quite cool . um . <EOS>
small , right . mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> audio player . <EOS> oh . okay . <EOS> so it should be a multi-functional uh gadget that would um control all your household uh uh machines basically . <EOS> yes , exactly <EOS> yes . <EOS> hmm . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> um yeah , <EOS> i can't can't really tell you . <EOS> i can i can tell you a whole lot about how it works . <EOS> but i don't know any decisions on <EOS> if they're if they're really options . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i'm sorry , <EOS> i did f <EOS>
whoohoo . <EOS> let's get started . <EOS> oh , no , <EOS> let's have the prototype presentation . <EOS> mm 'kay , <EOS> you ready ? <EOS> um sure . <EOS> you or me ? <EOS> y you read that stuff , since you wrote it . <EOS> okay . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> okay . <EOS> um if you have any questions , you know , you you can always uh contact me um or uh or your coach , i suppose . <EOS> wherever they're hiding ? <EOS> um so um <EOS> i think we conclude the meeting here <EOS> and we come back in uh uh thirty minutes , according to our timetable here . <EOS>
it's off . <EOS> it's on . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> the t_v_ turns on . <EOS> and when does it turn off ? <EOS> when you don't touch the control <EOS> but you go out of the <EOS> oh <EOS> so you have a <EOS> for for enough time <EOS> like uh you <EOS>
alright , so <EOS> we'll have the next meeting about half an hour , um . <EOS> i want the uh i'd like <EOS> nathan , i'd like you to work on just the basic look and feel , <EOS> what can we accomplish , um , given these parameters that we're just gonna sort of have this kind of uh non-remote remote . <EOS> um , what are our broad constraints before we deve design a prototype . <EOS> and um ron if you can <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> so if we can market it in terms of that <EOS> and yeah well <EOS> yep . <EOS> i think we got some exclusivity in that , <EOS> you know , we got something that nobody else has right now , <EOS> and and that means we can we can make some adjustments in the retail or wholesale price if we need to <EOS> and it also can create it's own demand from it's uniqueness . <EOS>
yeah from the t_ <EOS> i don't think it's enough , uh . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay . mm . <EOS> ah it's a it's a compromise , no ? <EOS> at least it's new and maybe technology new technology . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , that's why i wanted to to include the speech recognition , because you wanted all the new things . <EOS>
good point . <EOS> and the computer may not um be conducive to a meeting because um you tend to look at your computer and wanna have the urge to check something , you know , <EOS> it's useful but <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> okay . yeah . <EOS> because i really think i in a certain sense it almost like for me i would want to have that just , because i know at the end of when i'm done watching t_v_ that when i'm done , oh i better go find the remote and put it back where it belongs . <EOS> maybe th th th that's just some people that like that . <EOS> a lot of people <EOS>
fo five by ten . <EOS> l_c_d_ . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> tactile or something , yeah . <EOS> touch screen , yeah . <EOS> mm , touch screen . <EOS> so <EOS> but for now if we don't want to use such kind of screens i i think we using a a smaller screen is better , <EOS> because <EOS>
okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> so , i mean , if you're watching a movie and suddenly there is a dark uh some dark scene , the lights adapt themself . <EOS> the lighting in the room changes . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> s <EOS> yeah , but we are designing just remote control . <EOS>
well , but the but the mute <EOS> yeah , the scrolling is kind of you have to scroll all the way to make it mute , right ? <EOS> but if you hold it in , <EOS> if it's a scroll and click so you hold it in ? <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> fruity colours . <EOS> okay um <EOS> let's go to the ufe user interface <EOS> then we'll come back to the chip i suppose . <EOS> oh <EOS> and we want a curved case , <EOS> yeah ? <EOS> or a double-curved ? <EOS> well , <EOS> we don't really know what the difference is , <EOS> right ? <EOS>
yeah , <EOS> i mean it's <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> the other thing <EOS> i mean it i mean it would need to ha it would need to have um some sort of on board memory anyway . <EOS> um f for one for one thing because i do think that the menu system should be <EOS> um uh i mean although you know , it's not going to be terribly complicated if it's just controlling one device , <EOS> the menu system ought to be um <EOS> o ought to be customisable <EOS> and uh <EOS>
yeah , then i put it there . <EOS> no one wins . <EOS> it's a difficult choice , either here or there . this is a very interesting design . <EOS> ugly . it's just the same as normal . <EOS> oh a pen . well it has a l_c_d_ , i think . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> i think i it's kind of mangoey too . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i <EOS> okay , <EOS> i'm giving it a one <EOS> the mango put me over . <EOS> oh , mango <EOS> that that <EOS> mangoey is better , yeah . <EOS> i like mangoes . <EOS>
okay okay . <EOS> so my my feeling is that we w do want to observe this trend , <EOS> but we want to think also about the fact that it sort of has to fit in with something which is not specifically electronics . <EOS> um 'cause i think what we're in <EOS> what we're in is partly sort of home decor , partly something like a computer , <EOS> um so i think we might wanna be careful about how you know how quickly we create like a remote control in the shape of an apple or something , <EOS> i think that would be pushing it . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> w yeah . <EOS> uh yeah yeah , i see . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> you know just to <EOS> if you get frustrated wi remote control you can throw it , <EOS> kind of you know just uh you know um so . um okay <EOS> my from my role , i don't think that personal preferences but role preferences , <EOS> i think um something comfortable to hold , <EOS> um small and slim <EOS> i guess that's more in the sense of small and slim in terms of comfortable <EOS> not so small you can't , you know like a phone or something , too small phone . <EOS>
um you probably have to make it a bit bigger and a bit smaller . <EOS> 'cause remote con control , you can see it here , you have to bo reach both out both sides . <EOS> and here you just have one , few buttons . <EOS> so that's that's the main difference . <EOS> but looks <EOS> uh i definitely think we should go like this . <EOS> and then changeable fonts , <EOS> so <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> you do have it in your mobile phone though , don't you ? <EOS> because you have like <EOS> i mean every mobile phone now has like call this person and it calls them . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> but how frequently do we use it anyway <EOS> and um uh h ho how good is it , <EOS> you know uh voice recognition softwares are still quite uh <EOS>
it gets some seconds . <EOS> two two st two stripes . <EOS> so you have uh like a five seconds period to press those two buttons . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> it's it's no it's not a <EOS> oh okay . yeah . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> but that's th mm <EOS>
mm . <EOS> i know , and it becomes ridiculous , yes i know . <EOS> or a speech recognition , <EOS> which is extremely expensive , <EOS> i think that's the only way that you kind of avoid yeah , speech recognition , <EOS> but <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yes . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS>
so the battery is the in the sender . <EOS> yes . <EOS> okay . <EOS> so , now more design . <EOS> right . <EOS> thank you . <EOS> mine's not quite as complicated as all that . <EOS> that's what we like to hear . <EOS> did i press function ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> now we are supposed to give some oper offers right now . <EOS> i yeah . <EOS> eye . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> l_e_d_ . <EOS> the on-off button , in red . <EOS> here would be the volume . on the on the left , <EOS> okay , so <EOS> easy to turn on t and off . <EOS> and um so <EOS> this is a very cheap version <EOS> so there are <EOS> maybe you can carry on uh matthew . <EOS>
probably two . <EOS> you know . <EOS> if we eliminate the fact that you know it's impossible to guarantee that it's not gonna be lost then <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm . <EOS> i'd say two . <EOS> with the speech recognition , which of course may be changed depending on budget . <EOS>
that'd be good , <EOS> in fact a pen is about ten centimetres usually , <EOS> so that would be <EOS> that sounds like a really good size , if you see it there . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> that's great <EOS> and it's very bright as well . <EOS> so um okay . <EOS>
in real numbers , does the ninety one percent and the seventy six percent translate to ex in excess of the four million ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> to <EOS> um yes . <EOS> or eight million . <EOS> yes . <EOS> but would you pay more <EOS> and does it work <EOS> and is it approachable <EOS> and and did i know that it was it was an <EOS> that's a that's a very good question . <EOS> i don't know if speech recognition should be um should be included , <EOS> but i think it's an interesting <EOS> i think that maybe shows more about uh being open to technology . <EOS>
okay , well . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so y <EOS> ah that's a very good idea . <EOS> so you keep um <EOS> right we've got five minutes before we wind up this meeting , so i've been told . <EOS> i don't know if you've got the same . <EOS> okay . <EOS> so so keep um keep detailed functions um hidden at the back . <EOS>
oh yeah , that's fine . <EOS> sure . <EOS> works for me . <EOS> sweet . <EOS> cool . <EOS> so <EOS> i guess that that we're totally <EOS> we're making a remote control <EOS> which is thrilling <EOS> um uh but the idea is that we can make something based on the whole corporate model <EOS> i dunno if you guys had time to check the <EOS> in real life i dunno if you guys uh checked the um uh the corporate website . <EOS>
basically . <EOS> yeah yeah yeah yeah . <EOS> but i like <EOS> i mean when i say we have we had i believe we have room for creativity 'cause w this is we did it . <EOS> 'kay leadership , what do we report back to the bosses ? <EOS> no th th i think they were r reasonably flexible with us over the whole changing the specs thing . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> so on a scale of one to seven ? <EOS> 'kay . <EOS> okay . so . <EOS> look and feel . <EOS> well <EOS> you already feel that uh pretty much i think . <EOS> in i in my opinion mm-hmm . <EOS> purely feel is is is very good , is very good in your hand , so i i i would consider two or or may maybe even one for feel . <EOS> but that's just half , <EOS> we should also consider look , <EOS> and then
yeah . <EOS> solar . <EOS> yeah , so when i think it's <EOS> okay . <EOS> mm-hmm <EOS> . yeah . <EOS> it will be a <EOS> pro-ecology consumers . <EOS> uh cheap imprint so you s you propose low level chips would be uh enough to have something working well . <EOS>
yeah yeah , uh-huh . <EOS> there , mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah exactly . <EOS> uh so today i'm going to talk about the working design of the remote controller . <EOS> um can you go to the next sli slide please ? <EOS> okay . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> the metal is like uh <EOS> in a remote controller you have a chip integrated circuit which is like a brain of the remote controller . <EOS> it takes the power from a battery <EOS> say a battery it it can be a elec an electric supply like you have to uh like uh switch connec connect connect your remote controller to uh power supply from the you know electricity or something like that . <EOS> it should be a battery because uh uh remote controller should be like you you you should take it t to wherever you want <EOS> and then um uh th <EOS> this integrated circuitry takes energy from the power source <EOS> and whatever like if you press a button it's like a input for the remote controller <EOS> and it takes the input and it it transforms into a infro infrared bits and it sends it into the device , like a t_v_ or a air conditioner , something like that so . <EOS>
oh . <EOS> did you really ? <EOS> i just got blank ones <EOS> and <EOS> what ? <EOS> really ? <EOS> my slides were all blank , <EOS> they'd have a title maybe <EOS> and they were just empty . <EOS> yeah , mine too . <EOS> me too . <EOS>
but we can we can <EOS> i can i can take note uh uh <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i would think yes , yeah . <EOS> um the the only thing that we were considering was that uh this thing is kind of more for right-handed people than for left-handed people , <EOS> so if you're left-handed you're kind of left uh scrolling with your finger . <EOS>
yeah , yeah . alright . <EOS> and how it works , <EOS> okay . right . <EOS> i'm i'm on task . <EOS> mm . <EOS> and the m_e_ , what does that stand for ? m <EOS> marketing . <EOS> marketing , right . um . <EOS> marketing . oh it's written here , but um . <EOS>
uh first there are some new findings and new technology for speech recognition . <EOS> and this is that uh um uh uh you you ask you give a question through through the device <EOS> and it answers you . <EOS> and they already uh put this in an in a coffee maker . <EOS> and so that it you say uh good morning , uh coffee maker , and it says t says to you back good morning joe or what's your name . <EOS> this uh and there's an easy way to uh program that <EOS> uh you say record into the device into the speaker <EOS> and then you say the question <EOS> and three seconds later you say the answer <EOS> and then when you say the question it gives you the answer . <EOS>
mm-hmm , <EOS> mm-hmm , <EOS> mm-hmm , <EOS> exactly . <EOS> oh right , okay . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> i mean if you <EOS> yeah , <EOS> i mean sort of taking upon that idea , w the way i see this i is that it's uh the the s the structure in which we've we've approached this whole task is quite contrary to the p principle of teamwork <EOS> because the the tasks were d d sort of um divided , and then the work went on in isolation <EOS> i i don't know what you guys did while you were together , maybe that was a bit different , <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> i'm thinking yeah something like kinda almost like these pens , you know , <EOS> where there's you have plastic bits <EOS> and then it's not really rubber <EOS> but just kinda like a fused the plastic with rubber on the outside . <EOS> okay . <EOS> just a very thin sorta sheet for a a grip , sorta thing or for <EOS>
and compact . <EOS> and also strong . <EOS> trendy , yeah . <EOS> trendy design and compact . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> trendy design , compact and strong . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yes . <EOS> user interface concept , uh interface type , supplements <EOS> . that will be your area i think , right , jana .
i think i think battery , <EOS> and i think we all agreed on that . <EOS> that that's that's gonna be most cost-effective and the best thing . <EOS> battery . <EOS> battery . <EOS> battery . <EOS> yes . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay then chip on print . <EOS>
very good . <EOS> mm . <EOS> between uh all the coor <EOS> well , no , not exactly . <EOS> i mean my job from what i understood was to look at the usability requirements and make sure that the product is usable , it's acceptable to the people who are gonna use it and look at the best ways to do that . <EOS>
you are doing th <EOS> no , <EOS> i'm doing the interface . <EOS> . <EOS> are you using the you are doing the in <EOS> yeah i i'm i'm <EOS> well , maybe we have <EOS> okay so i industrial design . <EOS> it was a little confusion about my uh <EOS> but it's alright . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> and what we have to think about too is uh uh buttons that you use often are um maybe uh like when you fold it open , <EOS> when you have it closed , you can still uh do the th the functions . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> but n <EOS> yeah , <EOS> but uh i <EOS> basically when i'm watching t_v_ i'm just using like five buttons or so , <EOS> so . <EOS>
hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> just few actions , a few actions for everything . <EOS> all the rest , we sh we'll put it into this menu on the screen . <EOS> mm . <EOS> hmm . s <EOS> mm . <EOS> since we were targeting a really soon uh uh date for the the the um i issuing of this uh remote control <EOS> i think we will only concentrate on t_v_ for the moment <EOS> and then maybe m make it more generalised yeah . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> and well the info on the website which came too late . <EOS> um so i didn't really know what kind of functions we had to put into it yet . <EOS> so uh uh this is basically an overview of what we discussed in our last uh meeting . <EOS> those were my uh starting points . <EOS>
i did a little history on uh the the uh remote controls <EOS> and when they were invented and so forth , <EOS> so , <EOS> i guess this guy zenith uh created the flashmatic , <EOS> which i kinda like the idea , <EOS> 'cause it made me think of um um maybe the remote control made a big flash when uh you turn the t_v_ on and off , <EOS> that might be interesting . <EOS> and um so <EOS> it was highly directional flash light <EOS> that uh you could turn the picture on and off , <EOS> and the sound on and off , <EOS> and change channels <EOS> c <EOS> so i think um those are still requirements we have today , uh fifty years later . <EOS>
hmm . <EOS> do you wanna go back and look at the closing slide , <EOS> maybe that would provide some guidance ? <EOS> sure . <EOS> doesn't really tell us . <EOS> so <EOS> not really <EOS> this one we are talk ab <EOS> individual actions . <EOS> well <EOS> it says individual actions , <EOS> it says user interf <EOS> so i'm supposed to do the components concept , <EOS>
if we can go to to my display . <EOS> and we'll come back to yours <EOS> just to give everybody an idea of the market . <EOS> yes . <EOS> so now i'm gonna scare everybody out of this project . <EOS> if i'm still here . <EOS> yep <EOS> .
mm-hmm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> to produce it , yeah . <EOS> to produce it , yes . <EOS> mm . <EOS> but what else are we gonna put , <EOS> i mean not that i'm really gung-ho about it , <EOS> i don't know what else you can put in a remote to make it technologically advanced though . <EOS> so like other than just making it look good , how is it <EOS> i mean it can look really great <EOS> and still have the same up-n-down buttons <EOS> and why's anyone gonna buy a new remote ? <EOS>
alright . <EOS> okay . where do i find this ? <EOS> i'm not so g <EOS> display huh ? <EOS> okay . <EOS> uh display . <EOS> and then uh settings ? <EOS> appearance ? <EOS> huh . <EOS> mm i'm not sure i . <EOS> you read the newsflash ? <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> so you leave it alone . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> or it could be possible to have a a standard version of the remote , an expanded version . <EOS> yeah . yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> and do we want them in different colours , <EOS> or <EOS>
so <EOS> i suggest let's have a discussion on the control functions . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so <EOS> is there any discussion possible about the new product requirement ? <EOS> uh we can see if we can find a way uh between the functions we wanna use and the market we wanna reach with our product . um <EOS>
next . <EOS> so um our re model slightly resembling a giant delicious cookie appears to be a winner , <EOS> and uh hopefully we'll sell millions . <EOS> good job , team . <EOS> how did you get that in there ? <EOS> the slightly resembling a giant delicious cookie . <EOS> that was good . <EOS>
isn't <EOS> mm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i'd say maybe three . <EOS> i'll go for three as well . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> and i think i mean it it's tough to say <EOS> because we were <EOS> we didn't want it to be any more innovative than this , because then that would've defeated the purpose . <EOS> so i mean i <EOS> we'll put three , <EOS> but i think we actually reached our goal . <EOS>
print plate . <EOS> we also discussed that . <EOS> didn't we ? <EOS> yeah <EOS> but how did this how does that with a l_c_d_ screen ? <EOS> you still have a print plate . <EOS> uh <EOS> yeah yeah yeah . <EOS> you always have a print plate . <EOS>
you shouldn't on and off <EOS> because that's ver extra , that you have t first you have to turn the remote on , <EOS> and then you can uh <EOS> i don't know . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> uh <EOS> yeah , <EOS> i think it's it's not that easy <EOS> because i don't think people will like it who who uh that you have to turn it on first and then use it , <EOS> so i think it's better when th the t_v_ shuts down , the remote shuts down . <EOS>
just every e yeah , everything to do with this has to be revolutionised . hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm , i haven't actually got a display on my screen . <EOS> still , i'll do without that . <EOS> okay um , now <EOS> i wanna bring us down to earth again i'm afraid <EOS> and talk about the actual practicalities of how the thing needs to work . <EOS> um oh <EOS> and this is the methodology i used in preparing for this meeting . <EOS> um basically <EOS> i've been doing a little bit of web-based research , <EOS> and if i had a design team , i would've been discussing my ideas with 'em . <EOS> but the the net result is that i've come up with a first cut for the working design <EOS> that i'd like to discuss with you . <EOS>
uh , yeah , and y that's yeah . <EOS> and this would be more for browsing , ah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> to see uh <EOS> yeah uh <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> seems to be good . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> so the ru wait the rubbery we can shape it however we want ? <EOS> or the rubbery we cannot ? <EOS> with rubber we could uh sh pretty much shape it the way we wanted it , <EOS> but we cannot add scroll wheels , and we cannot add an l_c_d_ screen . <EOS>
ah . <EOS> um , yeah , <EOS> and i kind of like whales . <EOS> they come in and go eat everything in sight . <EOS> alright . <EOS> and they're quite harmless and mild and interesting . <EOS> mm . <EOS> okay . <EOS> god , i still don't know what i'm gonna write about . <EOS> um . <EOS>
a banana shape ? <EOS> oh it was sort of banana shaped . <EOS> and then the spongy feel . <EOS> i guess we could look at mobile phones and other technology that's out there . <EOS> c and look at different types of material that might please our users who want spongy-feeling remote controls . <EOS> so that's that . <EOS>
yeah , <EOS> v <EOS> but but you can open a from your pr from your laptop . <EOS> yeah , maybe . save as . <EOS> 'kay , <EOS> save it as an image <EOS> on the res <EOS> export . maybe not export function . <EOS> no . <EOS>
let's hope uh to have some uh d <EOS> i know <EOS> no <EOS> i think i think it's better to have l_ l_c_d_ screen , <EOS> because in the area of tw thirty six to forty five , we have about thirty percent of the market share in in our hands , <EOS> and fifty five of those people want l_c_d_ screen <EOS> and thirty five want speech recognition . <EOS> so i think it's better to keep it with l_c_d_ screen . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah when you zap usually you will have to press the same button all the time <EOS> and <EOS> yeah . <EOS> or we can do something like that . <EOS> we can design the remote control to have access . <EOS> you know some remote control have uh protection <EOS> and so you you y <EOS>
right . <EOS> it <EOS> well we don' have the you know , we can't say channel , and it changes the channel , channel eight . <EOS> and it doesn't cover anything other then t_v_ , <EOS> so i'd probably give it a three . <EOS> right . <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> so <EOS> there are two uh different types of uh um nice . <EOS> two different ways of using the the components for making a a remote control . uh the basic way is to use a an integrated circuit and some uh transistors with an <EOS> that aims at communicating uh uh the message and to to send the message to the um to the led <EOS> that will uh transmit to the receiver . <EOS> and uh yeah <EOS> the other components and the circuit board buttons , infrared , led , etcetera , for the components <EOS> um .
but uh uh i think basically i if we're going for i <EOS> if minimum number of buttons is our priority , then we should , as i say , r know , really bite the bullets and and reduce the buttons to absolute minimum , <EOS> you know , <EOS> possibly with backup channel and volume buttons and on off . um and nothing else . <EOS> um so that it can al it could uh almost end up like that , <EOS> but again , except that um you know the risk of losing it . <EOS> um anyway okay um so <EOS> kate , wh what are your uh your thoughts on this ? <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> do you think there's any chance of um having ser in having basically the same machine with the same buttons but maybe several different shapes ? <EOS> yeah that is also possible i uh yeah i i yeah . <EOS> oh yes . <EOS> is that gonna be a possible ? <EOS> 'cause that might help with the marketing . <EOS>
'kay , <EOS> so whe where is the remote control ? <EOS> so , <EOS> we are <EOS> so <EOS> where ? <EOS> it's here . <EOS> okay . <EOS> let's go for our detailed design meeting . <EOS> yep . <EOS> so i will still play the role of the secretary , <EOS> and <EOS> we'll have um first the project presentation by our user interface designer , david jordan , <EOS> and our industrial designer , baba . <EOS>
um , f_ five and escape'll bring it back and just uh the left button for advancing . <EOS> escape . <EOS> okay , so um i'm the interface design designer , <EOS> user interface designer sorry , <EOS> uh i'm concerned with um w what effect the apparatus should have on the user <EOS> and um i'm i'm also <EOS> i want to point out that our motto , put the fashion in electronics , <EOS> so obviously we as a company we want to make our products trendy and fashionable , it's a big concern of ours . <EOS> okay , and how do i press n just the next button ? <EOS> the arrow ? <EOS>
twenty five euros ? <EOS> mm . <EOS> i it's it's reasonable , <EOS> s quite <EOS> yeah . twenty five . <EOS> it's reasonable , i think , yeah . <EOS> is <EOS> it will uh be a an international remote control , <EOS> as we want to sell it in the entire world , <EOS> and the product costs will be not more than twelve euros and fifty centimes . <EOS> so , <EOS> as you will discuss about the remote control you will have to experience your um with the remote control . <EOS> um just uh maybe be imaginative with remote const con controls , <EOS> try to create something new <EOS> and people would like to to buy . <EOS>
that's before <EOS> the standards . what is available in the market off the shelf . <EOS> yeah . i have to say four . <EOS> actually i don't know what are the r the real specification of a of a universal remote contro <EOS> well it's not a universal remote . <EOS> remember we're focus we're supposed to focus just on t_v_s . <EOS>
oh okay , so i i mixed those numbers . <EOS> okay . <EOS> well i guess more realistically then , we need a product that's got some kinda nifty outer casing , <EOS> cheap plastic uh , you know , <EOS> um that should be just like uh a tenth of the price maybe or less . <EOS> an energy source which'd probably just be uh your regular batteries <EOS> um , we don't wanna have it <EOS>
also . <EOS> well <EOS> i think that this should be standard . large button large buttons . <EOS> yeah ? <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah <EOS> but it is uh one of the functions you have to uh specify . <EOS> because we can look at uh uh perhaps uh forty buttons at a screen , <EOS> but the elderly only look at two buttons . <EOS> okay . <EOS>
well i i was just <EOS> where would you physically position the buttons ? <EOS> um i think that that has some impact on on on many things . <EOS> um maybe you wanna draw onto the <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> um <EOS> so i'm just gonna um pop this in here <EOS> 'cause i have a slide about decision making which i'd forgotten about . <EOS>
yeah , <EOS> but we can still make it transparent . <EOS> so <EOS> or no <EOS> they can choose . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> you can halfs transparent , <EOS> or just that it's comes out a bit . <EOS> yeah okay . <EOS> good . <EOS> and in green colour , the back lights <EOS> or <EOS>
okay . <EOS> yeah , we can go to the next slide . <EOS> then uh there are different kind of chips , <EOS> one one is the basic chip and the regular chip and one an adva advanced chip . <EOS> so we can have regular chip for control . <EOS> pricing is a factor for us , that's why we'll go for the regular chip . <EOS> and uh regular chip supports speaker support , <EOS> so this functionality could be used for tracing the mobile phone which has been misplaced . <EOS>
at first i thought it was a dead leaf . <EOS> and then it landed on the wall next to me . <EOS> but this part was all brown and then it has these big blue dots like this . <EOS> and then it kinda <EOS> there was a green , i think it was a green ring , <EOS> and there was like red going out like this . <EOS>
no , i don't think we need to <EOS> i think the r_ and r_ , especially if the yellow and black one . <EOS> i think we just need the um the r_r_ , <EOS> yeah . <EOS> is it yellow and blue ? <EOS> or yellow and blue . <EOS> lemme go to the web page . <EOS>
that's lovely . <EOS> whoops . <EOS> okay . <EOS> that was fun , <EOS> right . <EOS> um finance-wise , we've got a selling price at twenty five euros , <EOS> which i don't actually know what that is in pounds , at all . <EOS> any ideas ? <EOS>
mm . <EOS> that's what i understand so , <EOS> hello . <EOS> upper management said yes . <EOS> uh e excuse that , that's a bit of spam . <EOS> and and so yeah <EOS> i'm a i'm a little bit stuck right now in that what uh w what is it that i'm gonna market ? <EOS> uh without special or increased marketable features i don't believe the product has a consumer demand . <EOS> uh i like the idea of of the scroll <EOS> makin <EOS> there are so many people making these products at this price right now . <EOS> what are we gonna do to make this one special and unique ? <EOS>
yes <EOS> . oh it's nice . <EOS> oh i think i killed the five . <EOS> i did . <EOS> i killed the four . <EOS> oh god . <EOS> and something hmm . <EOS> o <EOS> okay , as for the colours , we were presented with um a limited range of colours for this prototype . <EOS> but we're thinking that , seeing as we're having it in interchangeable casing anyway , <EOS> that this is not necessarily a representation of the true colours that we would necessarily use . <EOS> or the combination . <EOS>
yeah , that's right . <EOS> or you could do the switch channel up button above the the numbers and switch channel down button below . <EOS> but that's not <EOS> want to zap very quick , <EOS> so <EOS> yeah , <EOS> i think uh zapping is the highest priority . <EOS> and then you use those uh <EOS>
uh <EOS> and he's quite quite wee as well so you know he can doesn't take up too much space . <EOS> um <EOS> and uh and he does a funny thing where he chases his tail as well , <EOS> which is quite amusing , so <EOS> is he aware that th it's his own cha tail he's chasing ? <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> so <EOS> what about like batteries and things like that , <EOS> like are there some remotes that don don't require like batteries <EOS> or do all remotes require batteries ? <EOS> um i would imagine all of them , <EOS> but we could <EOS> but it's possible we could use like a lithium battery <EOS> um that would last a lot longer than like double a_s . <EOS> um like tho those are the batteries that are used in a lot of um m_p_ three players now and that kind of thing . um . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> there are several that have gone through with the watches , too . <EOS> you can customise a watch , <EOS> you can see how it is at the f at the end of the production , <EOS> you can change it uh <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> you y you don't use the banana when the banana is curving like that , <EOS> but when the banana is curving like that , with the wheel on the top and to control , <EOS> and here you have a a push button to <EOS>
oh , like <EOS> like <EOS> oh you could actually <EOS> i think we can go on the fact that it does just work with the ipod . <EOS> but the only thing is like , ipods are so expensive , <EOS> like , it has to be <EOS> is that part of <EOS> yeah , <EOS> i dunno , i dunno . <EOS> you don't think so ? <EOS> okay . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> oh . <EOS> so it's frustrated me in the past , th that . <EOS> okay , i have also some points uh . <EOS> maybe two points . <EOS> uh first would be that in current remote controls there is no back light , <EOS> so if you are if you are uh playing with this in the dark room it's it's probably worth to to have something like uh back light . <EOS> and maybe it could be also dependant on the the amount of of light in the room , so that if if it's in the day it doesn't need to be back lighted because it works on the battery , so . <EOS> so something like this . <EOS>
so <EOS> as you can see we g all going to draw a animal . just to uh uh just to get a bit familiar with it . <EOS> mouse wasn't running away . <EOS> that was interesting . <EOS> is everybody is anybody playing with the mouse ? <EOS> no . <EOS> okay . <EOS> we're going to uh draw animal . <EOS>
yeah , <EOS> i had what i just uh <EOS> i should again . <EOS> i miss a few buttons , <EOS> but . <EOS> well . <EOS> at least uh <EOS> what we should also have on , i just remembered , um a menu to go back through the first uh <EOS> if if you touch options , you can't go back to this uh right away now . <EOS> this <EOS>
i plan to do that as well . <EOS> so the the two blue are are those for the the it to charge off of in ? <EOS> ah okay okay . <EOS> exactly that's exactly what those are for . <EOS> and um there's one other feature that we were debating , but we decided to go against it , <EOS> is um you could <EOS> beep beep beep <EOS> we were thinking that it might be interesting to have a trigger button here because you have this finger <EOS> it it's it kinda feels like there should be something there , <EOS> but we couldn't figure out what button is important enough to put there . <EOS> and we we don't wanna accidentally be hitting the power button like that so <EOS>
it's just button . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yes . <EOS> yep . <EOS> do we need to say how many buttons , <EOS> or <EOS> yeah . <EOS> whoops , <EOS> don't want that , not yet . um <EOS> or d is it just one ? <EOS> no , <EOS> it just says push button interface . <EOS> button supplements , they'll be in a special colour of black . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> right . <EOS> conceptual design meeting . <EOS> right . okay , so <EOS> right well um from the last meeting i was trying to send you the minutes , <EOS> but uh it didn't work out too well , <EOS> so maybe in sort of um quick summary of the last uh meeting , i can quickly give you what we what we had . <EOS> uh right , so <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> then the angle you stop is the angle you is the channel you <EOS> yeah . <EOS> how d how do you know this angle is th is the correct one ? <EOS> it's it's very easy , because you kn you know how many channel are there in the <EOS>
um . <EOS> well we can chat away for uh for five minutes or so i think at at most . <EOS> just a couple of minutes anyway . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> m yeah , like a lot of a lot of what i've um read and prepared for this meeting fits in really closely with what with what craig's just gone over . <EOS> so in part i could i could give you some of my personal preferences <EOS> but i could also th add some to this which is just about sort of um sort of market research . <EOS> but anyway , <EOS> um we might come to that later . <EOS>
yeah . seven . <EOS> i would say five . <EOS> i'll say five . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> seven . <EOS> six . <EOS> plus six , <EOS> i say i said seven . <EOS> so it's six . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> s yeah . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> like mobile phones . <EOS> like uh the ipod . <EOS> uh just <EOS> yeah , okay . <EOS> okay , <EOS> it's chos <EOS> so that should be hard plastic . <EOS> then the buttons ? <EOS> yeah , that's cool . <EOS> i think . or maybe <EOS>
okay . <EOS> hi everybody and welcome to our kick-off meeting um for our new product that we're gonna be designing . <EOS> um i'm mandy and i'm the project manager . <EOS> and i know all your names again , courtney , fenella and amber . <EOS> alright . okay , <EOS> so first let's go through this powerpoint . <EOS>
okay . excellent . <EOS> right . so , <EOS> yeah . <EOS> um . hear from the user interface designer now i think might be an idea . <EOS> um , you've got your presentation now , <EOS> is it on the <EOS> is it ? <EOS> okay . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> so we are <EOS> yeah , that's included . <EOS> it's kind of weird that we we get this information now , afterwards . <EOS> because <EOS> yeah , no . <EOS> okay , so this is uh pretty much it this . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> damn , solar cells are uh expensive . <EOS>
may need more than three mm three button , three mm possibilities , ye yeah . <EOS> sh sure , sure . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> more than three actions that you may want to do at a given time . <EOS> mm yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> but for standard actions you usually what do you do , you change channels , you adjust volume , and nothing else . <EOS>
some <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah we we better so choose one <EOS> yeah yeah . <EOS> and also the screen , you cannot mould it . <EOS> you know kind of thing . <EOS> no no no no . <EOS> yeah so okay we should better choose one sh one shape . <EOS> but that's the kind of the idea , <EOS> so it lays good in the hand , <EOS> and then on on the side with with your thumb , <EOS> you you can you can use , <EOS> yeah , <EOS> you can use the button option <EOS>
uh . <EOS> ef effectively that's what the that's what they're saying , <EOS> that uh if uh if people are now using the internet then you don't need teletext , <EOS> so so take out teletext . <EOS> is that one of the <EOS> hmm . <EOS> taking out teletext , okay . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> well <EOS> yeah . <EOS> do <EOS> does it make more sense for the middle one to be an just an enter button ? <EOS> so then you would have to push two buttons every time at least . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> so it's just like channel six , six , enter . <EOS>
yeah . well <EOS> that it doesn't . <EOS> well , <EOS> n not exactly but uh uh if it had some games on it or something like that , <EOS> but it's for a remote control i think it i it would satisfy those needs . <EOS> yeah , the speech possibility , <EOS> the colours . <EOS>
yeah , <EOS> i mean it's not exactly right for the spongy point of view . <EOS> mm , yeah , it's not right , <EOS> so . <EOS> but it's still fashion . <EOS> but we could maybe have both like part of wood and some rubber for the buttons , <EOS> or <EOS> i dunno . <EOS>
so the consensus seems to be use the kinetic if it's at all possible . <EOS> be <EOS> but it does depend how much i mean how much it costs and how much more development and research it needs . <EOS> it costs . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm . <EOS>
oh , got it . <EOS> mm 'kay . <EOS> it's taking it a little bit <EOS> mm alright <EOS> i've never attached to anything . <EOS> mm , <EOS> neither have i . <EOS> 'kay there you go . <EOS> alright , so , <EOS> i don't know if you guys are able to get access to um the report that was online <EOS> or if i'm the only one who is . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> they like that . <EOS> see if they like it . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah maybe we should go through , yeah an uh evaluation . <EOS> because yeah the evaluation for us is is kind of <EOS> biased . <EOS> pointless . <EOS> so maybe you should we should do a kinda evaluation in the streets like asking to young peoples well , do you like to have a banana as a remote control . <EOS>
it's got a direction . <EOS> it's got but if you hold it if you hold it that way that's two curved , <EOS> one on this side , one on that side , but they're opposite sides . <EOS> well . <EOS> actually what's the differen <EOS> what a <EOS> what i if i put one here . <EOS>
selling point . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> i think the only <EOS> i think the only pitfall that we would have would be how much it's going to cost if that means we have to cut down somewhere else , <EOS> but i think pretty much we've used cheap relatively cheap and simple things . <EOS> the l_c_d_'s not cheap . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> kinda like holding a <EOS> mm . <EOS> right . <EOS> that minimises it size-wise as well . <EOS> minimise its size . <EOS> it could be you know really quite small . <EOS> mm . then there's maybe another point of making it a two-in-one kind of thing . <EOS> if we have a smaller a smaller device that actually fits into the big one . <EOS> you give it the full functions in here , <EOS> and just a couple of functions in there . like your zap zapping device is just u channels up-down , uh volume , and on-off . <EOS> that's it . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> tracking device for the remote control or some signal that you could find out where it was . <EOS> i dunno , <EOS> some kind of alarm . <EOS> you can press a button on your wall , signal , <EOS> 'cause it always gets lost . <EOS>
um i suppose the first to do the presentation will be the user interface designer . <EOS> okay . <EOS> um , so you're participant two ? <EOS> one one . <EOS> no no no . <EOS> no <EOS> you're <EOS> one . <EOS> no , <EOS> i'm participant one . <EOS>
monkey . <EOS> y you lose the banana , <EOS> you press a button , <EOS> and you hear like monkey screams or something like that to direct you towards the banana . <EOS> i th uh i mean if it <EOS> i think that's something that could perhaps be programmable , <EOS> though maybe have monkey as default . um . <EOS>
well , <EOS> it depends who your who's what the target people are , <EOS> like you'd say maybe the fashion conscious <EOS> maybe it's been targeted <EOS> women would be going , oh look at that , <EOS> 's cool , <EOS> it looks like a <EOS> it's <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> okay <EOS> well we have point three to get rid of somewhere . <EOS> we just report that it has to be over budget , <EOS> or the colours , you could take away s colours for th for the buttons . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> yes . uh <EOS> we have more , <EOS> we've got those the scroll wheel on the side <EOS> and yeah <EOS> so <EOS> i had a bad uh bad estimate , <EOS> right ? <EOS> w d <EOS> we have we haven't talk about a , <EOS> but that's no a is very exp inexpensive i believe <EOS> but it is not in the list . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> i'll just raise another point while it occurs to me , <EOS> it kind of applies to both our designers here , so i'm not sure how it would fit in . <EOS> if we flip open , <EOS> now you know how you've got some mirrors in nightclubs that are mirrors when you turn to them and you turn away and it gives like an advertising display , <EOS> you seen those ? <EOS>
yeah . good plan . <EOS> good plan . <EOS> okay , so we wanna go for plastic , <EOS> or what would you recommend for materials ? <EOS> honestly i'd recommend like um <EOS> uh since we're going with batteries instead of solar power , i'd recommend maybe a uh soft like latex , <EOS> because we could produce , you know how cellphones have those overlays that you can change the colour . <EOS> we could do uh one that fits in with the trends of the year so , <EOS> because this year is all fruit , <EOS> god only knows why , <EOS> um we could do f a cherry cover for this year <EOS> and then i if next year is stripes or solids , you know <EOS>
right . <EOS> okay i'm i'm okay with that . <EOS> i guess what i just want to me the next step is for these guys to come come in with the design proposal w with the cost estimate attached , <EOS> and then we have to take this to the next level . <EOS>
'kay . <EOS> i wanna change that . <EOS> i i gotta i gotta flashlight , and uh <EOS> yeah <EOS> but it's interesting 'cause you shake it like this . <EOS> like this . <EOS> okay . <EOS> you shake it . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so that's the next bullet is the um the kinetic provision of energy , <EOS> so it's like that flashlight where you have to shake it . <EOS> uh we've got solar cells , <EOS> which i don't think is a very good idea because um you could not use your remote at night <EOS> which doesn't make a lot of sense . <EOS> and finally we've got our cradle o our power cradle idea . <EOS>
sponge . <EOS> i think you need to look into the material . <EOS> yeah or furry like a pet dog kind of thing . <EOS> yeah yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> so <EOS> so we finished the prototype uh presentation if you have uh something else to say . <EOS>
yep . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> it gives it <EOS> yes . <EOS> a and the l_c_d_ screen is <EOS> yeah . <EOS> that's that's that's well it's quite innovative . <EOS> and all the scrolling uh buttons and menu and pro programmable device behind this . <EOS>
what what's <EOS> maybe yeah . <EOS> what's the price to p to produce ? <EOS> well so the price to produce for uh the simplest one , say we start from four dollars to produce such a device . <EOS> uh it's about it <EOS> with with with the charge ? <EOS>
yeah , sure . <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> complicated , yeah , of course . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> of course , yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> um and the <EOS> and the third thing that they wanna make sure um that their that the corporate image is being maintained , and that the corporate colour and design are being used on the product , <EOS> so that it's easy that that that they can be easily identified as a product of of of the company , and that there's no mistake that it could be somebody else who is bringing this out . <EOS> so i just wanted to interject this here so we're not getting too much off track here with uh with the things we wanna look at . <EOS> these were instructions from higher up so we have to eliminate uh these things , <EOS> so it's only gonna be t_v_ , <EOS> but the one thing maybe that could be um eliminated is the teletext uh idea . <EOS>
like a tracking device ? <EOS> like a tracking device <EOS> or or like a a <EOS> oh you can get those key <EOS> well <EOS> you could whistle <EOS> or make a noise <EOS> and it'd beep . <EOS> it makes a noise , <EOS> there's a button on the t_v_ that you press <EOS> and <EOS>
any outstanding ? <EOS> s any any other uh questions or uh comments to be discuss ? <EOS> no , i'm <EOS> go ahead . <EOS> what ab <EOS> i think we pretty much covered everything . <EOS> okay , so then uh <EOS> did you have something ? <EOS> well i was just wondering about if we're gonna do a product evaluation then what about time for redesign if the users come back and tell us no this is bad , this is bad , we want this done differently . <EOS>
then you put it in the fruit bowl ? <EOS> they can work from a <EOS> you don't have to hold it . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> you know , and then you just tal <EOS> i mean like everybody's got fruit bowl in front of the telly . <EOS> um . <EOS>
sure . <EOS> yes . <EOS> okay . <EOS> paul , was there room for crea creativity ? <EOS> beautiful . <EOS> mm uh i yeah , i think so . <EOS> i think uh everyone uh already . so <EOS> yeah m if we got a high mark for um uh innovativeness or innovativity <EOS>
so and last question , <EOS> will i change my rem change my remote control from mando banana . <EOS> um , zero . <EOS> no uh we can't . <EOS> so one . <EOS> actually yeah , <EOS> i we <EOS> well if . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> no uh let's say i'll put two . <EOS>
very democratic . <EOS> oh . <EOS> thank you . <EOS> thank you . <EOS> alright . <EOS> alright . <EOS> and new ideas found . <EOS> any new ideas to make these presentations more interactive and more interesting ? <EOS> mm . <EOS> come up with new product . <EOS>
okay , so based on that , <EOS> yeah , <EOS> um where is the es okay sample speaker <EOS> that is the sample sensor and sample speaker . <EOS> so um <EOS> but still , yeah it <EOS> we just need that actually . we're <EOS> we need one .
maybe it's hard t <EOS> uh <EOS> no , that's right . <EOS> so maybe we have to to uh keep it like mm a square , just normal remote control . <EOS> okay , but yeah . <EOS> just think about it . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> we have to close this uh to finish this uh meeting , <EOS> so . <EOS> there's some more things . <EOS> we have uh another thirty minutes , <EOS> so then we're going to meet again . <EOS> so you know what you have to what you have to do ? <EOS>
also we can be here <EOS> yeah , that would be cool . <EOS> uh-huh . <EOS> go back button is good . <EOS> i once had it . <EOS> yeah you can <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> uh uh we had that in in other countries . <EOS> yeah e even the history so you could like uh undo previous of the previous . <EOS>
or maybe like uh william was suggesting in the last thing some devices you put on key chains . <EOS> for l yeah , the whistle . <EOS> so we can if financially voice recognition is not feasible we could go for a whistle . <EOS> oh yeah , yeah <EOS> the whistle ones , yeah . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> mm . there's n <EOS> yeah . <EOS> 'cause that's the that's the feature that could be included in either of them . <EOS> although it is more with the spongy buttons on the um i mean <EOS> mm . yeah , <EOS> so a a point better for the for the number two . <EOS>
true . <EOS> mm . but if we're bundling it unless we're selling their telly with the remote . <EOS> right . <EOS> mm . <EOS> um <EOS> well <EOS> if we bundle it as a phone then you can always call it . <EOS> if you're not doing that then we can have something that just kind of rings from either <EOS> well <EOS> there used to be those whistling devices <EOS> but that's a little bit annoying . <EOS>
but you know our targets are very high , means fifty million euros is the profit which we want make . <EOS> what about <EOS> yeah , how many of these did we wanna sell ? <EOS> i can't remember , <EOS> twenty five . <EOS> twelve point five is the profit on one . <EOS>
so you can the the spongy <EOS> yeah , <EOS> i dunno . <EOS> i can't imagine a soft remote control . <EOS> no . <EOS> neith uh i don't like it uh neither . <EOS> no . <EOS> i just can't imagine it . <EOS> so <EOS> just hard plastic ? <EOS> okay . <EOS>
um what i think this indicates for our um design . i think we should make a remote for the future . <EOS> and this means we would um have to focus on the age ages sixteen to forty five . <EOS> uh this also makes up most the biggest part of the market , <EOS> so that will also be where our main profit would be gettable . <EOS> um this would mean we would have to make a fancy design . <EOS> um the results also indicated that um about one quarter of the people questioned thought that the remote control caused r_s_ r_s_i_ . <EOS> um this is certainly something to take into account . <EOS> and thirty four percent thought that it was hard to learn a n how to operate a new control , remote control . <EOS> so these are two factors that i think should be included in the design . <EOS> besides of course that the remote must look very nice . <EOS> and the functionality as a lot of people indicated , they only use about ten percent of the buttons , <EOS> i think we should make very few buttons . <EOS> uh this will also be uh beneficial to the design of the remote . <EOS> uh i think the most frequently used buttons should be emphasised . especially the channel selection and audio uh selection buttons . <EOS> 'cause they're used most <EOS> and so they should be robust . <EOS> they shouldn't break down easily . <EOS>
where you can activate it and deactivate it ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> sure . <EOS> okay . <EOS> sure . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> sure . <EOS> uh-huh . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> uh okay , <EOS> well do you wanna um give us your presentation <EOS> and then then we can <EOS> i don't know <EOS> um might have been a good idea to all deliver our presentations and then discuss , <EOS> but this is this is how we're <EOS> yeah , exactly , yeah . <EOS> oh it's something that's just occurred to me as well <EOS> is if we make it um speech reco if we incorporate speech recognition , that's appealing to people um maybe with a physical disability as well . <EOS> um . <EOS>
that they don't . <EOS> . <EOS> mm . <EOS> but the fact that this this rubber i is actually used in these anti-r_s_i_ ps specific <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah , the rubber's good . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> we're giving them a way to burn off steam , basically , yeah . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah , but we can get a production in , uh , countries like , uh , india <EOS> yes , yes , <EOS> countries like india or china or malaysia , <EOS> so you can go a better features and better price and you can sell more . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> 'cause you you know you're sort of you're badging it . <EOS> and in fact a lot of companies get somebody else to make them <EOS> and literally just badge them themselves with their own uh badge over the top . <EOS> and in fact the way they've got that there even if you had that on a white , which is the predominant colour of the uh the windows badge , you'd still be able to see it clearly from you know a white casing uh product . <EOS> so . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> 'cause what what i'm i'd be a bit worried about is if someone was h had previously developed habits of expecting to control surround sound or this and that with their controller and then and then they , you know , w they get ours and w it's doesn't have that . <EOS> i dunno if that'd be a problem . <EOS>
think <EOS> uh-huh . <EOS> well <EOS> i i heard of devices where you just uh whistle them <EOS> and and they <EOS> because of the the frequency they they just answer to that . <EOS> you can't whistle . <EOS> uh-huh . <EOS> or a clap . <EOS> and uh <EOS> and it's answered . <EOS>
maybe almost like a hairbrush , like you could get the about the width of that end of the pen <EOS> and then it widens up top <EOS> and you can fiddle <EOS> an <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> then wider up here . <EOS> and then it would have a l uh wider thing to uh have the light , the infrared light at the t_v_ and just kinda change channels and adjust the volume <EOS> and the power could be wherever , up up the top or something . <EOS> what do you guys think about that ? <EOS>
yi yes , <EOS> um yeah , i presume so . um <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> so then <EOS> you've got market range international <EOS> and you did say earlier it's got to be a um accessible and usable by sort of all age groups <EOS> just t we're not focusing on business market , any particular thing , it's everyone <EOS> user-friendly to everyone . <EOS> okay . <EOS>
i'm a excellent project manager . um . <EOS> i'm marty , <EOS> um i went to uni at uh u_c_ santa barbara <EOS> and i'm here working on a p_h_d_ in psychology . <EOS> um yeah . so <EOS> i'm sarah , <EOS> i went to michigan , <EOS> and i'm here doing cultural studies <EOS> and i'm the marketing manager or something . <EOS> marketing , <EOS> yeah expert . expert . <EOS> fine . <EOS> that's me . <EOS>
because otherwise we're just going to <EOS> i mean even if it's necessary or not , if you if you're given the choice between a t a remote with teletext or without uh when it really <EOS> if it i if it isn't more expensive for us to k make because as far as i understand it , it can be operated with the same set of buttons , yeah ? <EOS> so it should be in there . <EOS>
no , but you would slide it into uh someth like something on the back would hold <EOS> like you wouldn't be able to press the buttons , but <EOS> oh . <EOS> oh okay . <EOS> like it <EOS> or something like a flip telephone , something like that maybe . <EOS>
okay , fair enough , fine . <EOS> just because i n <EOS> for example if i'm using a mouse i like to be able to slide it up and down <EOS> so i thought it might be good for volume to just be able to kind of roll it and then have the up and down <EOS> and then the <EOS> this is my great little drawing . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> no , <EOS> yeah . <EOS> big target group . <EOS> so <EOS> yes , yes , <EOS> i don't think we have to <EOS> i don't think it's a case of worrying about different languages and things like that , <EOS> um making that a key point , <EOS> just that it's going to be in the international market like australia , america , things like that . <EOS> okay . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so , one or two do you think ? <EOS> i i'd say t <EOS> two . yeah <EOS> . i think <EOS> yeah , i think too . <EOS> two okay . <EOS> okay number ten . <EOS> did we somehow incorporate the company colour and logo ? <EOS> now is the colour gonna be there even if it's like vanilla ? <EOS> is the yellow <EOS>
okay . <EOS> mm ? <EOS> yeah <EOS> you should go to the top thingy . slide show . <EOS> oh yeah . <EOS> oh . <EOS> uh . <EOS> yeah . there it is . yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah i i've been thinking about a simple manner uh to put a lot of functions uh uh in one um in one uh remote control . <EOS> uh so uh you've got a lot of devi uh devices like uh d_v_d_ uh uh television , uh stereo . <EOS> so um <EOS> but uh it must be uh user-friendly . <EOS> so um uh <EOS> you c you can't put a a lot of uh functions uh in one uh yeah . uh uh uh yeah . in one um remote control . <EOS> but um <EOS>
yeah , yeah , yeah <EOS> and colours also , different colours , and <EOS> yeah i <EOS> mm-hmm colours . <EOS> no no no , it won't uh i don't think it will be like , <EOS> you can have you know for uh if you want ther there to be more <EOS>
mm-hmm , mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> um it goes to a different selection of buttons , <EOS> so it sorta keeps it simple . <EOS> um glow in the dark , is that sort of with a light inside it or is it sort of glow in the dark material ? <EOS>
and we were a able to modify each other's ideas <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> to fit in with our areas of expertise . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> each other's <EOS> oh does it have smart materials by the way ? <EOS> sorry ? <EOS> does it have smart materials ? <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> um clunky in what sense , <EOS> like um h heavier ? larger ? <EOS> um i think it's supposed to be the same size , but um it's got much fewer buttons . <EOS> it's , you know , it's very spread out <EOS> and kind of you know <EOS> , i get the idea it'd be sort of about this size . <EOS> got very few buttons on it and <EOS>
a compromise between what ? <EOS> uh instead of doubly curved we take a single curved . so to appeal a little more to the all the public . <EOS> so s <EOS> this , this would be uh single curved uh ? <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah there's only in in this dimension . <EOS> like this . so curvy or not . <EOS> yeah so we keep it singly c single curved then ? <EOS>
uh f <EOS> n yeah . <EOS> i think we are gonna have to narrow it down , <EOS> to say let's target these people and give them what they want <EOS> and 'cause you know , there needs to be some kind of selling point to it . <EOS> so um anybody anything there to add <EOS> just kind of young professionals , <EOS> uh th like <EOS> if we are going to include speech recognition , it's kind of between fifteen and thirty five seems to be like a really high response to that . <EOS> so we could say that was our target . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> okay , <EOS> you think one , <EOS> what do you think ? <EOS> i think two or three . <EOS> you . <EOS> three , yeah . <EOS> i'd say three , <EOS> so two it is then <EOS> or <EOS> two . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah uh <EOS> a two a two . just another two . <EOS> we like two . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> well <EOS> i'm guess i'm done . <EOS> that's my turtle . <EOS> okay . <EOS> your turn niels . <EOS> alright . <EOS> how to select the next or <EOS> here . <EOS> the next <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> here you go . <EOS>
yeah . yeah , sure . mm . <EOS> yeah . yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> uh it's <EOS> that might also be a good sales pitch again . <EOS> the remote that knows you . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . so <EOS> it's <EOS> yeah , marketing expert . <EOS>
uh i it's different . <EOS> mm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i'm just kind of pushing at that to see if you came out with anything else , <EOS> but i mean i totally agree . <EOS> we looked at those remotes , <EOS> i mean they are kind of anonymous , very similar looking things . <EOS> this would definitely be different enough , <EOS> i just wondered if anybody could come up with something even more <EOS>
okay . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> well <EOS> paul ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> like this ? <EOS> yeah , <EOS> not too far to the to the t pen top . <EOS> okay . um <EOS> let's make it um a dog . <EOS> ooh . <EOS> maybe you should hold your pen a bit more to the back , <EOS> so that <EOS> no , <EOS> to the <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
uh well <EOS> well the main , the main zap buttons are most central . <EOS> that was the the most important thing . <EOS> so uh the best place , <EOS> the best reach place <EOS> um on-off buttons , text buttons , mute buttons are together and at a place they easily are , easy to find . <EOS> um the on-off button is a bit bigger , uh so it stands out . <EOS> that way you don't have to make it red , 'cause it's will uh will show up . <EOS> uh scrollwheel is on the left side . <EOS> it's basically the be standard place for scrollwheel , as far as i know . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> and even for kids as well . <EOS> it's um it's safer for them , i guess . <EOS> like they don't flick onto channels and all that sl flick onto . <EOS> no porn channel for children . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> jus <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> oh . okay , <EOS> i draw . <EOS> the only thing i can draw is like this . <EOS> oh . oh . oh . <EOS> a duck . <EOS> no . <EOS> what's this ? <EOS> you love the eyes . <EOS>
mm-hmm . mm-hmm . <EOS> mm k . <EOS> true . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> what's difficult , we have all these things integral to the um to the design of it that we just can't back out of now , <EOS> it would have to be <EOS> seems like we'd have to go back to <EOS>
yeah that's fine . <EOS> so when you finish watching your t_v_ and you the you t you turn off the t_v_ , uh and then there's this message coming out that uh please put that back to the charger , <EOS> so so that's the or is it <EOS> that's the reminder part . <EOS> yeah <EOS> and um <EOS>
mm . <EOS> you did seem to include just in more detail what i've got though . <EOS> so so mine's a bit pointless . <EOS> right . <EOS> f_n_ and f_ eight , did you say ? <EOS> yes . <EOS> there we go . <EOS> i don't have it on mine though . <EOS>
yeah , <EOS> but actual environment ? <EOS> mm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> okay . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> okay . <EOS> very good . <EOS> um what about leadership ? <EOS> i don't know if that means like , if i did a good job or something . <EOS> i don't really know . <EOS>
right . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> if we want it to be more thin , then we'd probably wanna go with a triple a_ . <EOS> here we can <EOS> triple a . <EOS> but <EOS> it's okay , we don't have to decide about it now , <EOS> just as long as we remember battery type and size is important . <EOS> hey . <EOS> anything else ? <EOS>
okay , <EOS> we go on to the next one . <EOS> um 'kay um yeah . <EOS> uh some uh research uh a about um designing of an interface . <EOS> um the uh last meeting uh we had a about um uh using a f few buttons . <EOS> so uh um uh <EOS> that's w what i what i want to uh uh to do in uh our design . <EOS> so um <EOS> finding an attractive uh way to control uh the remote control . um the uh i found some uh something about uh speech uh recognition . <EOS> so <EOS> maybe uh we can uh use uh that . um <EOS> uh and uh using a little uh display . <EOS> so um <EOS> findings . <EOS> um yeah <EOS> just um we have just to focus on the primary um functions . <EOS> so uh <EOS> only uh buttons uh for uh sound , um for uh on-off , um uh shifting u up uh sa uh ca channel or uh down shifting down . <EOS> um uh let's see . um yeah and uh <EOS> we uh need some uh new a attractive functions <EOS> uh uh which attract uh uh people for using it . <EOS> so uh <EOS> it's uh like a speak uh speech uh recognition and um a special button for selecting uh subtitles . <EOS> just uh what we uh mentioned uh last uh meeting . <EOS> um and yeah <EOS> overall um user-friendly . <EOS> so uh <EOS> using uh large large buttons . um <EOS> it's uh possible to uh uh to make um quite cheap uh system for uh speech uh recognition . <EOS> um you can think about um uh when you lost your um remote control , you can uh call it and um it gives an um sig signal . <EOS> so uh uh yeah . <EOS> and and uh for uh shifting up a sen uh c ch channel or uh for um uh putting out uh sound or something , you can uh just give a sign uh say um sound off <EOS> or a and <EOS> uh yeah . <EOS> television uh put the sound off uh put the sound off uh . um <EOS> let's see . uh yeah . <EOS> i was thinking about the special uh button for uh subtitles , <EOS> um just one button to keep it uh simple . <EOS> uh one push on the button uh you get uh uh small uh subtitles . <EOS> um double push push um , if double click , um so uh you get uh big uh subtitles , for uh people uh um uh which c f uh who can't uh read small uh subtitles . <EOS> so uh um yeah <EOS> and w we have to keep uh in general buttons <EOS> uh so um <EOS> we've got um the buttons we have to use . the on-off , sound on-off , sound higher or lower , um the numbers , uh zero to uh uh nine . um the general buttons m more general b one button for shifting up and shifting down uh channel . <EOS> um also we want to uh use a little d display uh for um for displaying the uh the functions of the buttons . <EOS> and um we can uh build in a function f which uh shows the channel or some uh which the t television is on . <EOS> so um <EOS> made a little uh picture of uh it . <EOS> um see . um yeah . <EOS> just um we can put uh the on-off button uh over in this uh corner , <EOS> um almost uh e all uh remote controls uh are using a on-off button on that place . <EOS> um so uh people uh will uh recognise uh um the button . <EOS> so um <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> the titanium <EOS> and so it's very uh <EOS> titanium . <EOS> again uh and the battery life is uh is an is an endurable one , <EOS> again because this is a_a_ batteries you can choose the types of battery you want . <EOS> lithium-ion may be a good one , <EOS> but you can replace it with cheaper one , <EOS> again you pay for what you get , <EOS> and then um y the other p points are robust and misplacement reminder . <EOS>
which <EOS> right , <EOS> and then the remote control would know um what's being produced by the television . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> and that's a sort of basic r_f_ kind of frequency so it'll be cheap . <EOS> right , right . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> right , right . <EOS> um . <EOS> yeah that's certainly possible <EOS> then an another thing was about this losing the remote and trying to find it again . <EOS> if you do have this sorta speech interface to it , you don't even need to find it . <EOS> you just say you know , um whatever you whatever you want the remote for , <EOS> you know to change the channel or to uh turn the t_v_ on and off , <EOS> you just shout your command to it and it would do it for you if it's within you know , within hearing range . <EOS> and uh you know it could be somewhere in the room y that you've no idea where it is and it would still do its job . <EOS>
yeah , <EOS> if uh <EOS> no , <EOS> you don't yu a no you then you don't no ni don't <EOS> then you don't use it . <EOS> yeah <EOS> and if the television does not support such uh operations <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> we don't have to use that top . yeah . <EOS>
fox . <EOS> a fox yeah . <EOS> firefox . <EOS> dog . <EOS> no . <EOS> aye . <EOS> cat . <EOS> it's a cat . <EOS> not quite yet through . <EOS> it's a cat . <EOS> mm . <EOS> a cat who had an accident or <EOS> why a cat ? <EOS>
yeah , d with the colour , um does it have to be all yellow , do you know ? <EOS> please god no . <EOS> um . well , i wouldn't th i mean , <EOS> my reaction to an all-yellow remote control wouldn't be anything other than horror , so <EOS> i think just having it <EOS>
i also think though that it shouldn't have too many buttons , <EOS> 'cause i hate that when they have too many buttons and <EOS> i mean i know it has to have enough functions <EOS> but like , i don't know you , just have like eight thousand buttons and you're like , no , you never use half of them . so . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> banana . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , the m the means were very very good , the means we used . <EOS> mm-hmm , <EOS> the whiteboard digital pens . <EOS> we like the pens . <EOS> and the pens . <EOS> uh i like the pens . <EOS> i want one . <EOS> that would just be so cool , to d do all your notes and s <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah , i think possible . <EOS> because we can we can uh mix uh several function in one button . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so lets you then you have less buttons . <EOS> but i'm not sure <EOS> yeah , <EOS> but do you think it will be easy to use ? <EOS> because if you have many functions just for one button it would be quite difficult for the user to know . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> al all circuit boards are pretty much the same , i think . <EOS> uh it's fairly fairly standard . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> um okay , <EOS> then we'll move on to the case . <EOS> um oh <EOS> bu <EOS> i guess maybe if we decided on like a simple , a regular , or an advanced chip , maybe . <EOS>
yeah ? <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah . okay , let's <EOS> uh thank you for your participation . <EOS> thank you . <EOS> thank you . <EOS> i was actually kind of upset you know at the budget , and that we had to cut a lot of stuff . <EOS> it's like man , we we can't have the locator thing . <EOS> and s <EOS> yeah that's just bad . <EOS> do you think maybe the prices were were made ? <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> say about that . <EOS> okay . <EOS> so <EOS> there's no <EOS> this uh look and feel thing , though that's not a technological innovation . <EOS> so i'd be up for seven for innovation . <EOS> s so that <EOS>
yeah , i think so . <EOS> so <EOS> mm . <EOS> i suppose you have to design it <EOS> and you have to take care of the industrial way to transform it . <EOS> okay , <EOS> so i make uh u user interface . <EOS> you you de you implement the core functions in the <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm . <EOS> so this these are just some thoughts i have on it , <EOS> and um i dunno what you feel about whether we can just say we have one target group and for this one target group we're gonna design this one thing <EOS> or whether we're looking at what we like we we talking about different shapes , whether that different shape also includes maybe different uh buttons uh for different groups . <EOS>
i guess <EOS> yeah . <EOS> right . <EOS> sure . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . sure . <EOS> okay , <EOS> what we'll do is now we'll take for lunch break , <EOS> okay , <EOS> then uh we can discuss furthermore , okay , with our areas , <EOS> and uh then we will come back again in the in the next meeting . <EOS> so thanks for coming <EOS> and uh i'll send you minutes of meeting , <EOS> and uh please put your all information in the sharing folder <EOS> so everybody can share the information . <EOS> okay ? <EOS>
eagle . <EOS> yeah , no yeah , <EOS> an eagle . <EOS> and uh , birds of prey aren't they , <EOS> oh dear , <EOS> intrepid . i'll put that , intrepid . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> there we go , <EOS> hope that pen's gonna be okay . <EOS>
is it control function <EOS> ei oh , th there you go . <EOS> oh . <EOS> um . okay so i'm gonna talk a bit about the technical functions design . <EOS> i'm louisa , the user interface designer , as you know . <EOS> um so the m basic method of this is to send a signal from the remote to the television set , so that a desired function is performed . <EOS> um an example of the function could be to change the volume up or down , <EOS> uh so obviously you need two different buttons for that . <EOS> um to change the channel , either by pressing the number that you want or by channel up or down . <EOS> um to switch the television on or off , maybe a standby button . <EOS>
right . <EOS> mm 'kay . <EOS> so , <EOS> i investigated the remote control market in greater detail , <EOS> and my uh the theme of what i was to work on was uh trend watch . <EOS> and <EOS> 'kay . <EOS> sorry . <EOS> i'm glad to see the marketing budget is being so well spent on . <EOS>
i'd say the integrated . <EOS> yes unfortunately . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> 'kay . <EOS> button supplement ? special colour ? <EOS> um special form ? special material . <EOS> mm . <EOS> we could of course make the buttons wood . <EOS> say mahogany or so <EOS> it'd look really lovely . <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> or s or smelly . scratchy <EOS> uh well <EOS> i was really thinking a lot about the i_ uh the imac kind of gel gem tone . <EOS> it's hot on the streets , guys . <EOS> right , well <EOS> i i i think some of this um <EOS> you're gonna be a little disappointed with some of the things i have to tell you , <EOS> but i'm afraid this is the real world . <EOS> so um <EOS>
well hang on . <EOS> do don't speak so <EOS> it's in here , in that <EOS> w do we have any <EOS> we have special form don't we ? <EOS> so that's yeah . <EOS> but the the the <EOS> we haven't talked about any special colour though <EOS> uh i don't th <EOS> if we're going for greys and silvers then i don't think we're <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> definitely less cluttered <EOS> and i mean <EOS> but still it's <EOS> sorry <EOS> i was just <EOS> i'll just uh resume something else i was gonna say . <EOS> the the style of these is terrible . <EOS> i i i really think we need to uh <EOS>
um . <EOS> was the goal in your in your prototype design that it be as low profile as possible ? <EOS> what do you mean by profile ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> sort of flat as possible . <EOS> no . <EOS> you see i envision it as being um quite deep <EOS> sort of deep enough to be comfy to hold in your hands rather than being wide and flat . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> you all have to be paid . <EOS> mm . <EOS> ah <EOS> we have to make <EOS> we have to sell at least four million to make our own profit . fifty mill <EOS> excuse me ? <EOS> oh <EOS> you're g very good in mathematics . <EOS> four million . <EOS>
interface designer . <EOS> particularly with maybe small children that they couldn't uh watch a channel that is undesirable . <EOS> it should be compact . <EOS> her personal favourite was it should be t-shaped . <EOS> and maybe have an anar alarm-clock . <EOS> and the material should possibly be not of non-allergic nature . <EOS> uh the different systems uh that exist are infra-red or radio-waves . <EOS> uh maybe it should have uh electri electrici electricity saving feature . <EOS>
project documents , <EOS> sorry , <EOS> i put it in the shared documents . <EOS> uh right , <EOS> that's that's the that <EOS> it goes there automatically if you put it in project documents . <EOS> project documents is on the um desktop . <EOS> uh yeah . <EOS> right , that's great . <EOS> but i cou can't open that , because it w asks uh for some username or password . <EOS>
well <EOS> i'll t i <EOS> no no yeah <EOS> i'm just gonna write a couple of 'em down . <EOS> see i'm a big music fan <EOS> i don't know if you guys are , <EOS> i'm assuming everybody likes music to some lesser or greater extent <EOS> but <EOS>
oops . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> well what <EOS> and it is quite bright <EOS> and <EOS> yeah . <EOS> maybe in the middle again , three or four or something ? <EOS> s <EOS> okay . <EOS> uh <EOS> i mean you know loo losing things is one of those things that people can lose , i mean a million ways . <EOS> you can pick it up and walk away with it and then you've lost it . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> roll it back and forth like that , <EOS> but with uh <EOS> i don't know how you would hold a capsicum and <EOS> it's kind it's kind of it's more uh <EOS> it's really ergonomic , it's fit in the hand and you've a lot of surface to to put the controls . <EOS> okay let's move on . <EOS> so time is running , <EOS> let's move on . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> it's hard f i <EOS> it's easy for you to remember it . or to recognise it , <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah , why not . <EOS> we'll have big discussion i suppose after that , <EOS> so . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> oh . <EOS> yeah me too , . <EOS> i i've got the same problem as well . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> here we go again . <EOS> welcome . <EOS> uh we have again three presentations and then we have to decide on what concepts the mobile phone has to uh f the remote control has to support . <EOS> so who wants go . <EOS>
oops . <EOS> that's as far as it goes . <EOS> hi guys <EOS> uh good morning everybody here . <EOS> and uh i want to introduce myself , <EOS> uh my name is uh shrida daseri <EOS> and uh i'm a project manager for this new project which we are going to discuss now . <EOS> so i want to introduce first of all uh the names and the colleagues here . <EOS> and what you're uh drawing ? <EOS>
it is . <EOS> fair enough . <EOS> the basics . <EOS> mm . <EOS> 'kay . <EOS> um it's th uh with this voice recognition option as well um just as for the simple functions the um the on off , channels , volume , um <EOS> right . <EOS>
according to your distance to and the angle maybe , if you have a stereo system . <EOS> distance . <EOS> according to the distance . <EOS> yeah yeah yeah . <EOS> uh i'm not sure about the screen , <EOS> wha what is the use usefulness of the screen ? <EOS> uh is it a touch screen by the way ? <EOS>
um , oh i still haven't got my glasses on . <EOS> yeah , okay . <EOS> so these are the some of the pictures of existing ones . <EOS> i'll just walk you through them . <EOS> this one is a voice recognition . <EOS> and that's the kind of idea we're going for . <EOS> there's um an l_c_d_ thing , <EOS> which we thought could <EOS> i thought could get a bit confusing and a bit expensive as well for us . <EOS> this one is got a kind of scroll like a mouse , <EOS> which <EOS> yeah . <EOS> um and but i'm not exactly sure how you'd use that , <EOS> like would the computer come <EOS>
mm . <EOS> oh yeah . <EOS> well mm , did it come into the into <EOS> i dunno if we counted that in the costs . <EOS> oh yeah . <EOS> if if it if it <EOS> if it can be afforded . <EOS> okay ? <EOS> well with that achieved , our last slide is our closing slide . <EOS>
spongy ? <EOS> what's the approximate per hundred thousand for the titanium ? <EOS> oh fya <EOS> i don't have an information on that . <EOS> however our company obviously can provide us with uh with the titanium , so i assume , i'm , i was given an okay to use it . <EOS> it certainly is an expensive material , <EOS> i'm aware of that , <EOS> but i was given an okay . <EOS>
um gabriel , you're gonna be working on , you know come up with the the user interface design . <EOS> then basically , you two are gonna be working together on this . <EOS> you won't be going off to your separate offices . <EOS> alright . <EOS> okay . <EOS>
it's very true , <EOS> because we designed it to be very fancy , <EOS> so <EOS> yeah , i think two . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> but <EOS> it's very fancy , i think . <EOS> have you ever seen a remote control like this ? <EOS> we should perhaps <EOS>
you don't know me . <EOS> i could lose that in a minute . <EOS> so this is <EOS> no this is a very big , you cannot misplace it anywhere . <EOS> so this is a jumbo universal remote control and it's impossible to im misplace or lose . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> so maybe we can just integrate it on th on one side , the double r_ . <EOS> mm . <EOS> okay yeah , yeah . that's actually good idea , so <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm . <EOS> so we have the logo , we have the colour , and we have the fashion in electronics , <EOS> so we have the slogan too . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> i think there are ways we could maybe simplify the <EOS> interface . <EOS> well just the the the circuit board that we're using inside , <EOS> i'm not sure really how complicated our um <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> our needs are . <EOS> i mean all we have is two push buttons and two scrollers , <EOS> do we really need an integrated circuit to <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . four maybe . <EOS> four ? <EOS> okay . <EOS> four yeah <EOS> that <EOS> four , four . <EOS> now we th th <EOS> then we settle on four . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i will gi <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> uh suitable for the consumer ? <EOS> that was um <EOS> totally . <EOS> yeah definitely . <EOS> yeah <EOS> i think it made we met all of the consumer <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> wants . <EOS> uh is it complicated ? <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> so um <EOS> in each of these uh phases we'll uh basically be handing over to yourselves , the designers of this uh this device . <EOS> yes . <EOS> and uh having uh meetings so that we can uh during the course of the day um come up with a better better inst implement than we had before . <EOS>
um uh they finally had a conclusion that younger people um uh under an age of f forty five are uh more interested in new features . <EOS> and <EOS> but they're more critical . <EOS> and older people uh want to spend uh more money . <EOS> but uh they uh they don't want to uh have a lot of uh new features , <EOS> because they're in their old uh thinking way . <EOS> and they want to keep the old uh things the old things . <EOS>
'kay . <EOS> so depending on what we want our functionality to be , um the chip could be expensive or it could be cheap . <EOS> um depending on the n amount of memory we need in there and stuff like that and h and h you know how much power . <EOS>
it's the fat cat , okay . <EOS> yeah , it is a <EOS> can you draw uh um rabbit ? <EOS> oh , <EOS> hat ha <EOS> rat . <EOS> a rat ? <EOS> that's difficult . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yes <EOS> you have to draw a rat if you want a rat . <EOS> it's your rat . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> but it it's not clear what you have to to to type uh type in your presentation . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i i had a whole idea and then just was typing it and then oh . i have to do that so switch . <EOS> yeah <EOS> yeah exactly . <EOS> this presentation is mainly based on my own ideas 'cause i hadn't time to intergrate tha the information yet so <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> we can . <EOS> great . <EOS> i don't think that's uh not possible , <EOS> it's uh <EOS> okay then , l uh let's wait for the production , okay , then uh you can evaluate the product , <EOS> so how it looks like technically and uh how it look like uh the real . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> um the teletext is outdated , <EOS> the internet is important , <EOS> it's only to be for a t_v_ <EOS> and it must include the corporate image , colour and slogan um <EOS> which i think is more in the user uh range , with steph . <EOS>
i don't know what else , <EOS> but <EOS> no . <EOS> or do we have any buttons ? on the remote . <EOS> which one ? <EOS> but that's also in the l_c_d_ , <EOS> right ? <EOS> yeah , <EOS> but on the l_c_d_ , <EOS> huh ? <EOS>
yeah , standing . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> we could just widen it out uh <EOS> yeah <EOS> and uh it just needs another uh another logo somewhere is is is is all <EOS> it gives gives people the option <EOS> and if if say if they've got them um <EOS> because actually have several upon the uh <EOS>
yeah <EOS> for <EOS> yeah , <EOS> the basics then by a volume , channel , one till two zero numbers on it , <EOS> oh teletext doesn't have to be ? <EOS> um other functions . <EOS> yeah <EOS> i had <EOS> standby options , <EOS> yeah ? <EOS> uh yeah . <EOS>
yeah . ah um okay . <EOS> um so my pres personal preferences for this problem is we have to meet the user needs . <EOS> if we can make it look fancy then we might sell more than our uh concurrent , <EOS> okay . <EOS> and definitely if it could have less buttons , still maybe the same number of um functions , but less buttons , <EOS> this would definitely be a good way of selling more . <EOS> okay . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> and buttons would , did we say ? uh different shapes of buttons ? <EOS> um i l i su <EOS> i mean for the specific functions , you know , up and down , uh play , stop . <EOS> they've got , i mean , they've got standard sort of intuitive um <EOS>
okay . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> and then you can <EOS> you can place the screen here , which can come . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so the keywords are primary co colours , spongey ? <EOS> and but then i w i would <EOS> spongey . <EOS> i would do the arrows here , kind of thing . <EOS>
oh right . <EOS> 'cause it'd be quite subtle and <EOS> yeah . <EOS> it looks more <EOS> think like vanilla and banana would . <EOS> banana's more representative of our colour scheme , like the company the yellow and black . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay yeah . <EOS> so that for corporate identity that would probably be the most strength . <EOS> i mean watermelon , you know , m probably appealing to the <EOS> yeah , seasonal . <EOS>
yeah <EOS> w i think that l_c_d_ screen should be like <EOS> yeah <EOS> it it's supposed to be bit s bit s bit <EOS> yeah . <EOS> .. . <EOS> this was your size , <EOS> but i think it should be larger . <EOS> yeah <EOS> three quarter of the of the <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> so uh we do need to avoid little ambiguities like these . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> nice . good point . <EOS> but we wouldn't have a specific volume up and down . <EOS> if we're having the scroll wheel , then it's gonna double up as all the other up and down functions . <EOS>
y yeah . <EOS> wood ? <EOS> i think we can get the quality materials then it shouldn't influence the design principles too much , which you'll see with my presentation . <EOS> one thing we'd have to check though is what the users whether how quickly the novelty wears off of having uh <EOS> yeah , for example . <EOS> so , <EOS> have to see how kid-friendly it is and and all that , <EOS> but <EOS>
in the hand . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yes , possible . <EOS> yeah . but <EOS> yeah . <EOS> and i could talk to the t_v_ television itself . <EOS> i need not have an <EOS> except if if you are far from the t_v_ . <EOS>
my favourite animal huh ? <EOS> it's like pictionary ? <EOS> yeah , <EOS> you can guess what it is . <EOS> the the one who says it first gets a raise . <EOS> may uh paint uh next . <EOS> it's a pork ? <EOS> no , it's not an orc . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> no no no . <EOS> it's uh it's uh i i <EOS> i must do it . <EOS> yeah , yeah , yeah . <EOS> 'cause we uh really don't know each other , <EOS> and uh it's kinda new . <EOS> so getting used to each other , we can uh have a little fun then , <EOS> before we uh dig in really to the hard stuff . <EOS> that kind of thing . <EOS> would you start with drawing your uh favourite animal ? <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> the female shape yeah . <EOS> with two uh <EOS> obviously . make it more appealing to guys . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> we we could make some some rubber uh some rubber uh yeah mouse , with which you can change uh <EOS> and so if you <EOS>
right . <EOS> mm . <EOS> can we do marketing piloting too ? <EOS> try to see what kind before we launch can we see how they're received ? <EOS> right . <EOS> um it's an option , <EOS> uh but actually there's i've got some research already on like what we're looking at and trends in casing right now <EOS> which actually might even come into play beforehand , <EOS> it may help us decide for now . temporarily anyway . <EOS>
those new ones . <EOS> can we afford that ? <EOS> can we afford to include one of those ? <EOS> and will somebody buy it if we don't ? <EOS> well <EOS> i i don't think <EOS> yeah <EOS> i can't see anybody buying a lap a remote control that they have to plug in <EOS> so we'd have to see some kind of new battery technology . <EOS> okay so <EOS> let's go with a um touch screen <EOS>
um , <EOS> okay great . <EOS> oh oh here we go . <EOS> there you go . <EOS> yep , there we go . <EOS> so um i'm thinking here about uh primarily about customer needs , <EOS> that we start with the customer , <EOS> and w you know , what they want <EOS> and what are issues with with um existing products . <EOS> uh to think about trends <EOS> and also about try and connect that as you see with the company vision <EOS> which is about fashion in electronics . <EOS> um and then , as i say uh w we'd like to prioritise our design features from this <EOS> and um <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> yes . <EOS> 'kay , yes . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> i'm not exactly clear on what we're designing the rem remote for . <EOS> is this a mun multi-functional one <EOS> or do we decide that ourselves as we go away and work on it ? <EOS>
um from all all three of your uh presentations , i think that we were on the right track a lot in our last meeting . <EOS> um we want something that looks good . <EOS> um we want something that's simple . <EOS> we want something that you can find easily . um <EOS> and the speech recognition i i guess is kind of uh give or take . <EOS> it's gonna cost more . <EOS> s <EOS> the young the younger people say that they like it . <EOS> but um it's <EOS>
agree . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> you can you are . <EOS> why not ? <EOS> and because of the fact that there are so many buttons in these remote controls <EOS> that nobody use , <EOS> in fact they don't even know how to use them , <EOS> so most of the the people say they they don't know how to they to use properly their r remote controls . <EOS>
yep . <EOS> both in i i <EOS> or we just have to choose . and adapt . <EOS> because , when we choose for this one we have to we have to make it more attractive <EOS> and w when we to d for this one we have to make it more cheap . <EOS>
s <EOS> th this i th that's always gonna be a problem i think . <EOS> um and i i i s <EOS> so <EOS> i suppose one um <EOS> mm . <EOS> could make it so desirable that if people lose it they immediately go out and buy another one . <EOS> anyway , <EOS> sorry , <EOS> carry on . <EOS> do you want to just carry on with <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> do you have any preference uh of order ? <EOS> um i'd like to um hear <EOS> o i'd like to hear who's g who's on the um from from uh catherine actually first . <EOS> i want <EOS> what i'd like to hear about is uh if we've finally decided on um what sort of energy we're gonna be using and <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay , so we want um for our target group would we say , i mean , young and old , all age ranges , <EOS> all um , <EOS> not kids obviously , <EOS> right ? <EOS> or kids ? <EOS> no , <EOS> kids need to know how to use a remote , i would think . <EOS> they gotta change between disney channel , cartoon network . <EOS>
and uh it would cut out the r_s_i_ as well if you <EOS> a thought <EOS> and it it cuts out uh i was was gonna say , you can't get a lot of r_s_i_ , <EOS> j just get jaw ache . <EOS> okay , <EOS> sorry . <EOS> yeah , um oh yeah , so <EOS> possibly the speech recognition is possibly something could add into the design . <EOS> oh , <EOS> i've got some other things <EOS> i couldn't fit onto this presentation . <EOS>
mm-hmm . might need <EOS> so . uh <EOS> andrew , any thoughts about uh how we might market interchangeable fronts on on the remote control ? <EOS> um , well <EOS> we could either market it together by getting control in a set colour <EOS> or with like you buy it with several <EOS> uh like <EOS> you ge you get the f uh the face-plates with it when you buy <EOS> or as a separate thing , <EOS> but uh maybe thinking of that , it's considering the nature of the device , maybe a second thing like a second campaign to market new facials for your to your might go a bit astray <EOS> since it is the kind of thing where y you generally get one <EOS> and then forget about it . <EOS> unless you were trying to <EOS>
mm . <EOS> um what i found from the research is that most the current controls are just basically big bricks with loads of buttons all over them . <EOS> um they're not very attractive to look at , <EOS> and they're not very comfortable to hold , <EOS> they're <EOS> i just hold 'em like big bricks , <EOS> and they're very easily lost . <EOS> um they tend to be very dark colours , <EOS> so if there are shadowy places down the side of couches you can't really see them . <EOS>
if you remember yeah <EOS> but that's <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so uh . <EOS> basically what we want here is a remote control <EOS> right . <EOS> so um the question well first of all what to control . <EOS> so most people want to have a a remote for their hi-fi and t_v_ and stuff like that . <EOS> and but other people want th also remotes for controlling uh and toys like robotic pets and little robots and stuff <EOS> and other people also want to have remotes for controlling um whole house . <EOS>
i have to do working design so uh <EOS> . so <EOS> you're <EOS> that's but this but number three , <EOS> yes . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> so , <EOS> my name is mark dwight , <EOS> and um i am responsible for user interface design . <EOS> however , uh mm project manager asked me to give you some presentation about technical functions design . <EOS>
oh . <EOS> it's not saved yet . <EOS> okay . <EOS> so <EOS> okay . <EOS> our beautiful drawing . <EOS> so just f um <EOS> so this is our agenda . <EOS> you're <EOS> f you're going to show your pr prototype presentation after me . <EOS> oops . <EOS>
gouges . <EOS> oh my god , <EOS> and we've all been a pretty congenial team here , i think . <EOS> we hadn't had any ma fallings out . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i mean minus you guys being wha what is it , the survey , annoying or what is it ? <EOS> irritating , yeah . <EOS> wow that's a it's definitely a strong one . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> okay . <EOS> and the production cost should not exceed hopefully should be less than twelve fifty euro . <EOS> mm 'kay that should keep everybody on their toes and challenged . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> profit . <EOS> um is fifty mm . <EOS> so these are all things , of course , to remember with the budget and when you design <EOS> to materials , cost , etcetera . <EOS>
uh are there other people who will be contributing to the plan ? <EOS> yes , of course , <EOS> if you need some help , uh so let me know . <EOS> so , who are the people you need uh from the marketing or uh the technical side or uh the administration point of view , okay , to add in any documentation , or some technical point of view , <EOS> so just let me know so i can uh coordinate all the teams . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> but first i will uh tell you something about the tools we have here . <EOS> i already talked about the cameras and microphones , <EOS> but they are not of uh much use to us . uh <EOS> we will have to take advantage of these two things . <EOS> they are smart boards . <EOS> as you can see , you can give a presentation on them . <EOS> and uh this one here is a white board . <EOS> i will uh instruct you about that soon . <EOS> um as you also noticed uh this presentation document is in our uh project folder <EOS> and every document you put in this folder uh is uh it is possible to show that here in our meeting room . <EOS> um and yeah there are available on both smart boards <EOS> but i think we will uh mainly use this one for the documents in the shared folder . <EOS> as you can see , this is the same tool bar uh as is located here . <EOS> um the most functions uh we will use will be to to add a new page , <EOS> um uh to go back and forward between pages , <EOS> and of course uh to save it every now and then . <EOS> um and this is the pen with which you can draw on the board , for instance <EOS> like this if everything's okay , <EOS> but i first have to put it on the pen , <EOS> you see i'm new to it too . <EOS> um and then you can write things like test or whatever you want . <EOS> as you can see you have to move it a little bit slow , <EOS> it's not such a fast board , <EOS> it's a smart board but also a slow board . <EOS> uh but you can write things <EOS> and of course you can also , when you click here , uh erase things , <EOS> so we have uh est left . <EOS> and um you can also delete an entire page , <EOS> but we ask you not to do that . <EOS> just simply create a new one <EOS> and uh start all over <EOS> because we want to save all the results . <EOS> um does everyone understand this <EOS>
spongy means it it's like sp <EOS> fruit vegetables is the the new <EOS> have you seen the last exposition of clothes in milan ? <EOS> no , i missed that one . <EOS> yeah , i i didn't miss an <EOS> i didn't miss and i saw that the fruit , there are many fr pictures of fruits and vegetables in the clothes . <EOS>
yeah , that's right . <EOS> and which you don't use . <EOS> yeah <EOS> but you could uh i thin uh <EOS> there's a possibility to g uh to uh to put those buttons uh behind some uh kind of uh protection <EOS> so that if y y you only get to see them when you need 'em . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> marketing expert . <EOS> okay . <EOS> thank you . <EOS>
no . <EOS> uh-oh . <EOS> this is it ? <EOS> um , there are a few changes we've made . <EOS> um , well look at the expense sheet , and uh it turned to be quite a lot expensive to have open up and have lots of buttons and stuff inside , <EOS> so instead we've um <EOS> this is gonna be an l_c_d_ screen , um just a a very very basic one , <EOS> very small um with access to the menu through the the scroll wheel and uh confirm <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . yep , yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> are we having it that it's any angle , or is it just <EOS> as uh as wide <EOS> cer certainly wider angle than than current , <EOS> so that if you're holding it , you know , anyway like you're likely to and uh it's uh you know , i i it will work most of the time um . <EOS>
fancy . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> n that um <EOS> did you just break the pen ? <EOS> yeah <EOS> uh the uh is fancy . <EOS> so <EOS> let's let's take it to the next level . <EOS> well <EOS> d <EOS> we'll just call it fancy then . <EOS>
well <EOS> with the one-handed design you also have the the problem of the size <EOS> w <EOS> 'cause you know from cell phones , they can be too small . <EOS> so if the remote is too small it <EOS> if it's small it probably looks better , <EOS> but <EOS>
yeah , it was a little difficult to incorporate the cover with the cherry fruit on it . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> but it's <EOS> so we do have removable covers , right ? <EOS> yeah , well then that's covered . <EOS> and so we n k <EOS> everybody have that ? <EOS>
so it'd look like this kinda . <EOS> yeah , that's what i was thinking . <EOS> like a gourd almost , or a squash of some sort ? <EOS> uh . <EOS> yeah , maybe that's what they are . <EOS> 'cause that you can hold it in like the bottom bit <EOS> and <EOS>
mm . <EOS> i think basically basically you will get instructions to work with <EOS> and if you have any questions uh , uh i guess , you can uh <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay , i think i have enough to think about 'til our next meeting . <EOS> how about you people ? <EOS> really ? <EOS> okay . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> polished . <EOS> okay <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i kinda i like the potato look . <EOS> it's very different . <EOS> it's what ? <EOS> oh sorry <EOS> the mango the mango look . <EOS> yeah it is , fruit or vegetable depends on your mood . <EOS>
i agree . <EOS> the third <EOS> the third one is uh about the the the image of the company . <EOS> so um uh we should we should keep uh the the product should be recognisable . <EOS> uh , uh <EOS> it's that mean we should use the colour of our company <EOS> and maybe put somewhere the s the slogan of the company , which is uh , we put fashion of in electronics . <EOS> so , when people see the the remote control , they should say oh it's from real reaction and he s they should recognise the company . <EOS>
i know that you all are a distance from cutting edge marketing research , <EOS> so you know , <EOS> i'm just gonna try to cloak it in really professional terms here . <EOS> what's hot , <EOS> fruit and veg . spongy . <EOS> and this is all over the catwalks , paris , milan , and i'm talking about clothing , furniture , shoes . <EOS> this is really interesting change from past years , <EOS> because it is much more organic , <EOS> um some would say approachable . <EOS> and i think if we're to refashion our view of what we want in a remote control , we should perhaps think about incorporating technologically interesting fabrics and some of the bold colours into a simple handset . <EOS>
um couple main ones being like , i dunno , lemons or strawberries or something . <EOS> the buttons could be fruit-shaped . <EOS> oh well <EOS> it's quite easy to s shape thing like carrot <EOS> isn't it ? <EOS> or maybe the buttons could be shaped like different fruits . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah we get the <EOS> yeah well , this is basically uh it's <EOS> alright the remote ? <EOS> um well usually the power button is on top i guess . <EOS> the remote ? <EOS> the remote , yeah ? <EOS> basic . <EOS> is on top . <EOS> which should be easy , easily reached with the thumb . <EOS>
different languages , uh different skins and stuff like that . <EOS> mm-hmm . w <EOS> mm-hmm . how uh how uh how you want say the um the the menu structure for flicking through channels if you've got lots of channels . that sort of thing . <EOS> sure . <EOS> i if it was customisable as in different languages and stuff , that does open <EOS> it is supposed to be international , <EOS> right ? <EOS> so . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> well , <EOS> the thing was they would provide y an agenda with s like several points , <EOS> but it wouldn't have a slide for each point . <EOS> and that's the only way i remember that i need to go other that point . <EOS> i know personally when i do powerpoint , that's what i do and so <EOS> i had it once , <EOS> even if it was just like the title of it , like the three presentations , and i would do your three . <EOS>
depending on how i <EOS> i mean we've got this memo saying that it's something that the company's looking into , so <EOS> yeah , depending on the expense of it . <EOS> and they've got in stock , <EOS> so yeah . <EOS> um that seems to make sense , <EOS> but if it turns out that it's hugely expensive we'd have to cut down somewhere else , then it's worth thinking about . <EOS> but i think we'll find out more about cost afterwards . <EOS> right i'm going to wrap it up there . <EOS>
hmm . <EOS> okay . <EOS> so you'd be advocating an l_c_d_ then ? <EOS> i think that's that's one way to go , <EOS> yes . <EOS> um i mean there are there are advantages and disadvantages if you if you have an l_c_d_ display , <EOS> it's it's nice , <EOS> because it's it it lets you just sort of sit there and st and control your television from your armchair . <EOS>
i mean that depends upon your design , so <EOS> anyway for for the users who who who opt for l_c_d_ we'll give them the give them the l_c_d_ , <EOS> we give what the customer uh wants , right . <EOS> i mean <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so without l_c_d_ you want to put it fi the same level of innovativeness ? <EOS> and which do you recommend e easy to use , with l_c_d_ or without l_c_d_ ? <EOS>
uh six <EOS> the marketing research started on s on the age of sixteen . <EOS> sixteen to twenty five , twenty five to thirty five , thirty five to forty five , something like that . <EOS> so um <EOS> yeah it's below forty so we can decide where to <EOS>
yeah , that's that's a good that's a good one , <EOS> because the clock would be really friendly , <EOS> and and when is your favourite show coming on <EOS> and <EOS> mm-hmm , mm-hmm . <EOS> yes . <EOS> yeah , and we display a clock . <EOS> mm yeah . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , true . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> in fact , i don't know , <EOS> i s <EOS> because i in my presentation i don't have here with <EOS> so <EOS> it was in fact the design use to show you the design of what is inside a what is inside and what are the different component of the r <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> and for the marketing guy ? <EOS> uh tha that was good but we should have more brainstorming like meetings , maybe . <EOS> 'cause we just presenting one is presenting his stuff <EOS> yep . <EOS> next one his stuff and then we try to combine afterwards , so it um . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> right um , <EOS> and practical limitations which i kinda threw out the window . <EOS> and so i did a little research <EOS> and unfortunately all i had to work on was our uh our corporate archives of the great products we've made before , <EOS> which include , you know , um space craft , coffee makers , and bullet trains <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> i played i think seven times solitaire something . <EOS> oh <EOS> did you ? <EOS> is it on there ? <EOS> is it on there ? <EOS> i didn't find the didn't look but uh <EOS> i didn't look , <EOS> but <EOS> you did ? <EOS> well , <EOS> i didn't have time for that . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> 'kay . do you get a good grip on the rubber ? <EOS> yeah okay . <EOS> yeah um <EOS> and if you make it from that super rubber , when you drop it on the floor it can bounce right back up in your hand . <EOS> you don't even need to lean down to get it . <EOS>
well , don't forget well , don't for <EOS> don't forget who we're targeting also <EOS> who are f f who are wh <EOS> yeah , youngst youngst <EOS> youngsters . <EOS> actually maybe <EOS> yeah but it says i , i would buy this , so . <EOS> no well yeah <EOS> i <EOS> if you would be young . <EOS>
repetitive strain injury . <EOS> is installing a new remote control something that people <EOS> uh , no , that did not come up at all . <EOS> um so here here is another um sort of a a review here of the main things . <EOS> i also found that most people would <EOS> uh adults at least would pay more for voice recognition . <EOS> now apparently we do have access to all the tech cutting edge technology in remote control . <EOS> so i dunno <EOS> if that's possible we might consider getting into it . <EOS> um . <EOS> and and again here as we sort of move m sort of thin start thinking about how we wanna sell and market this , <EOS> i think a recurring theme here is the company wants it to be wants us to make something that's fashionable and sleek and trendy . <EOS> um people uh additionally aren't aren't liking the appearance of their products , <EOS> so we wanna think about as we take all the sort of the techie features how we can um put that into a unit which is which people like . <EOS> you know , they like the aesthetics and the ergonomics . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> right . <EOS> so you pick your menu and then your different options <EOS> and when when you click on each one , it you can go into a new menu for that . <EOS> i'm getting a bit uh specific here . <EOS> really we'd have to use something to show you , <EOS> but <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> so once we decide exactly what we want , then we can figure out the exact positioning , <EOS> but more or less i think it should go along those lines . <EOS> so what's your , uh , the comments or uh s <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah , okay . <EOS> so if it's dow it's d uh <EOS> yeah . <EOS> or if it's down under the couch cushions <EOS> um which is where i usually find mine . <EOS> um <EOS> right . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> right . <EOS> okay , well we can use <EOS> we can still use the glow in the dark as a gimmick essentially , <EOS> um if we're gonna have to <EOS> if we're gonna have the logo on as well , <EOS> bright yellow logo in our our um <EOS>
mute misschien also . <EOS> mm . <EOS> uh well <EOS> new product should reach a market with customers that are younger than forty , <EOS> and now we have current customers uh of forty plus . <EOS> forties , okay <EOS> because because younger people as <EOS> uh younger people have now , sixteen till to twenty five age , are f eighty one percent interested in l_c_d_ screen . <EOS> from twenty six to thirty five have sixty six percent , <EOS> and thirty six to forty five , fifty five percent , <EOS> so i think to um <EOS> because on most recog remote controls um the print plate will be broken how much , two years . <EOS> you have to press h very hard to go to the next channel . <EOS> with the l_c_d_ screen it's easier <EOS> because you only have to wipe the screen to uh for fingerprint , <EOS> and then you can use it again . <EOS>
hmm . <EOS> okay . <EOS> so i i don't see any reason for having an l_c_d_ <EOS> 'cause it's an increased cost . <EOS> unless you can think of something interesting to do with it . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah right now there's right now there's nothing coming out of the t_v_ to receive , <EOS> so you know unless technology changes and information starts coming out of the a cable box or something there's no s i don't see the , <EOS>
that's funny . <EOS> so . <EOS> i always do that , leaving it in my coat , and then like using a different coat . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yep . <EOS> but i guess it's 'cause we don't carry remotes around that much . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> can't really take it into the other room . <EOS>
yeah i know what you mean , <EOS> kind of like a . <EOS> wait , <EOS> like like this uh a bit . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so it's a bit square , but it's also a bit uh round . <EOS> kinda like a beer glass . yeah . <EOS>
it's something that we're supposed to sell for about twenty five euros <EOS> um and you know , <EOS> goals for profits are i think somewhere around uh fifty million euros , what they wanna make on it , so . <EOS> mm . <EOS> also since we're partners of the international remote control association , <EOS> maybe we wanna make it something that would globally appeal . <EOS>
first of all our project aim . <EOS> um we are creating a new remote control which we have three goals about , <EOS> it needs to be original , trendy and user-friendly . <EOS> i'm hoping that we can all work together to achieve all three of those . <EOS> um so we're gonna divide us up into three compa three parts . <EOS> first the functional design <EOS> which will be uh first we'll do individual work , <EOS> come into a meeting , <EOS> the conceptional design , individual work and a meeting , <EOS> and then the detailed design , individual work and a meeting . <EOS> so that we'll each be doing our own ideas <EOS> and then coming together <EOS> and um collaborating . <EOS>
you just press <EOS> yeah , <EOS> just click . <EOS> that'll be fine . <EOS> so <EOS> the findings that i got uh very just very briefly is that you have a choice of the way that the information is projected to the receiver <EOS> and in my opinion infra-red is the best way to do that <EOS> 'cause you don't need a sight line . <EOS> so that's one thing we're gonna work on . <EOS> um the user interface is critical here , <EOS> because a lot of the things that happen in a remote control happen through the chip that controls that converts the electrical energy into data , <EOS> which then goes through the infra-red , <EOS> so the the chip that uh i think ian is designing , is gonna be crucial . <EOS> and really it all comes down to the to the user , <EOS> because they're the one that's controlling most of the working design . <EOS> so <EOS> the components that we find here are the energy source , you know the battery or whatever that's gonna m make it work , then the chip , which converts the data , the user that's controlling the chip , and the infra-red bulb that's gonna let us move the data to the receiver . <EOS> so you have four main components <EOS> and they are designed sort of like this . <EOS> you have your energy source right there <EOS> which then um brings uh energy or information to the chip , <EOS> which is also controlled by the users . <EOS> you have energy going to the user who's controlling the chip <EOS>
something uh <EOS> uh . <EOS> something like <EOS> sh <EOS> take your time . <EOS> plus minus plus uh <EOS> almost . <EOS> minus . <EOS> yeah <EOS> but i think when you are holding it , you could press the minus and the plus and with the other finger the minus and the plus . <EOS>
that's right . <EOS> but all these things are usually in-house so we don't have much problems . <EOS> so component cost is going to be the least . <EOS> anyway , we are not using really advanced technology , <EOS> l_c_d_ has already been ruled out , a_s_r_ has been ruled out . <EOS> so it's the basic thing but very trendy and very user-friendly . <EOS>
yeah , <EOS> that's a little problem , of course , as well . <EOS> and <EOS> yeah , <EOS> maybe you just have to make it uh that's not scrollable too easy . <EOS> like this . <EOS> and uh what's the channel choose ? where do we uh put that ? <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> graphical interface ? <EOS> uh on the <EOS> you can have it on the telly though . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> you've <EOS> yeah , i know what you're saying , <EOS> you have to <EOS> you know . <EOS> but you're gonna have to scroll to get channels . <EOS> so um <EOS> i guess that's wh why i was thinking you may need to have some kind of a screen <EOS> because <EOS> so that people can go arou go back and forth and choose if <EOS> or or <EOS> then again if you just <EOS> i guess i c <EOS> i can see like some kind of a thing where like you sort of have like the number come up on the t_v_ like what channel you're on . <EOS> you can just scroll and you can just get to like five or like twelve or <EOS>
yeah , <EOS> it's i think it's usable . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> that's active . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> or just a green one , <EOS> because it's if you use it , it's green or the red , it's r green . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so <EOS> yeah . <EOS> maybe uh <EOS>
works for me . <EOS> prototypes , you mean . <EOS> in um <EOS> yes , the prototype uh prototype product evaluation . <EOS> we probably should do some market tests uh once we have the prototypes and do some orders and things like that and test-market it . <EOS> yes . <EOS>
so , um <EOS> we have been provided with uh some uh w technical tools to uh to communicate and to well , learn from each other's plans <EOS> uh as i can say <EOS> um so <EOS> w we will also try to uh to get acquainted to this tools <EOS> so <EOS> they are also new to me <EOS> i don't know whether you worked with them before . <EOS> um then we will come to the uh to the to the actual project plan . <EOS> you all know i hope how it's about uh the uh new r remote control we are going going to design . <EOS>
i dunno , i'm feeling like a big boy . <EOS> mm . pro <EOS> probably not , <EOS> 'cause he's 's been listening to too much . <EOS> he's getting retarded . yay . <EOS> so <EOS> i believe i can fly . <EOS> alright well we got some exciting stuff for you guys . <EOS>
i'm person two . <EOS> and which one , <EOS> uh probably the first one . <EOS> i'm not sure <EOS> but check the first one . <EOS> i most of the things i have to write myself on the board , but <EOS> yeah , that's it . <EOS> just <EOS>
okay . <EOS> i'll give it a two , because at the moment it's not looking that way . <EOS> one , i give it a one . <EOS> well , that's that's just like that's a clay , it's a prototype . <EOS> what do you think ? <EOS> oh , and ma it's a prototype , <EOS> right . <EOS>
yep , <EOS> i think <EOS> okay . <EOS> what would you specifically like marketing to look at before the next meeting ? <EOS> or shall i just sort of generally look at all the issues involved ? <EOS> true . <EOS> okay . <EOS> i think you might get guidance , <EOS> but um <EOS> i th <EOS> instruction manuals , <EOS> 'cause there tends to be a
mm . <EOS> if it's a really small t_v_ maybe . <EOS> broke . okay . okay . <EOS> okay . okay . <EOS> okay . okay . <EOS> so the com the um the uh <EOS> the committment is the following , <EOS> we don't go for speech recognition technology . <EOS> the l_c_d_ is still on disc is still open to discussion . <EOS> it is up to you to go through this um uh this way and to to report report me back next meeting . <EOS> so <EOS>
yeah , okay . <EOS> uh so so yeah , that's it , <EOS> so just you can do your presentation <EOS> for uh <EOS> which one first ? <EOS> okay . <EOS> oh it doesn't matter , <EOS> just start with the <EOS> okay . <EOS> mm . uh <EOS>
um i think we'll we'll start that initially with the functional design already but then <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay , so that's just a brief overview of the p the the project itself . <EOS> um what i'd like us to do now is simultaneously introduce ourselves and start using some of the tools that we're using for for the project , <EOS> specifically the whiteboard . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> ben bana <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i can't see tha <EOS> although , th i mean to be to be sure they have got i mean they are going crazy with the l_c_d_ technology now , <EOS> so that you've got your l_c_d_ t_v_s and everything <EOS> so maybe the small <EOS>
now what . <EOS> 'kay , hello everybody . <EOS> uh , i guess you all know what is it about , <EOS> you all received the email , i guess . <EOS> uh , we are actually doing this meeting to start a new project which is about designing a remote control . <EOS> so i'm going to be the project manager of this uh project . <EOS> and uh so i'm present myself . <EOS> i'm fabien cardinaux <EOS> and uh i i guess you can present yourself . <EOS> so i dunno , you can starts . <EOS>
recogniser . yes . <EOS> mm yeah . <EOS> okay , so why don't we put down speech recognition if possible pending some more research from our industrial engineer on how expensive that is . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> right . <EOS> yes . <EOS>
that's what i mean . <EOS> we can increase the cost . <EOS> okay . <EOS> so i don't know i don't know whether having <EOS> 'kay . <EOS> i just wanna make sure everybody's on board with it . so <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so we really need to be sure as to what we can push the cost up to , <EOS> though we haven't got to a stage where we're ready to pin down the price of components . <EOS> but i'd say what sorta price are we looking to be able to sell something like that , <EOS> and what sorta price can we make it for ? <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> but that's gonna be a problem , <EOS> 'cause you don't always have all left-handers or all right-handers in a family . <EOS> but then yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so bu it's it's not a huge problem , <EOS> because i i it is operatable . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> yeah , and me also , <EOS> like , this product me uh me uh me uh this meets all company strategy <EOS> like our product should be as per customers' requirement , as per latest technology , and it should be environmental safe . <EOS> so since our product meets all these requirements , so i would also prefer to give it rank one . <EOS> so four six six <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> the spon yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> bit of a stress ball feel . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yes . i would . <EOS> my goodness . <EOS> there you go . <EOS> genevieve ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> thanks . <EOS> and you ? <EOS>
mm . <EOS> of course in that we could put l_c_d_ or recognition to be more technologically innovative . <EOS> and the third one is easy to use . <EOS> well i think that the technical in innovation is is in the product itself <EOS> since we haven't yet a remote who are allowing to to choose interactively with the t_v_ screen uh uh with just four buttons . <EOS>
yeah <EOS> but the problem is how to s <EOS> you know <EOS> if this is a push button controller , you can send this con this remote control everywhere in the world , the same one . <EOS> if you have the language , you have to develop for each country . <EOS>
the wheel doesn't work . <EOS> great . <EOS> okay so um while uh researching this this topic i first of all just thought of a couple of things that i would like to see in a remote , <EOS> and just uh looked to see if they're actually available in any current remotes , <EOS> and then also searched for which are the top-rated uh remote controls on epinions dot com , which is a a you know a a customer um written basically review site . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> has jokes when it's ready . <EOS> nice . <EOS> great . <EOS> and uh that is about it . <EOS> great , wonderful ron , cool . <EOS> lot of good ideas , good facts to have . <EOS> mm . <EOS> that's what they need , it's like a little dongle <EOS> it just sticks up this further <EOS> so you don't have to stand up every time , <EOS> just connect it , my kingdom . <EOS> right so , <EOS> good to know all that stuff , <EOS> thanks guys , um . <EOS> now we kind of have to come to some decisions , <EOS> um , i figure we can just go down the line <EOS> and all three of us can have a chat about it . um . <EOS>
uh , <EOS> no . <EOS> hmm , can't you then just say copy ? <EOS> bling . <EOS> new page . <EOS> paste . <EOS> yes . <EOS> ah . <EOS> select none . <EOS> just tap somewhere . <EOS> just tap somewhere . <EOS> just up somewhere b uh besides it , <EOS> right . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> i liked the , i liked the litt <EOS> ooh come back . <EOS> back . <EOS> oh . <EOS> no . <EOS> oh yes , cool . <EOS> okay , i'm gonna stop playing with the little pointy thing . <EOS> um okay , so like <EOS> what it shows is how much things are used relatively <EOS> and what you can clearly see from that is the thing that's used most is the channel selection . <EOS> what you can't see is volume selection , it's a little bit higher than all the others . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah but how how intuitive is it to turn things to change channels ? <EOS> you just tu turn d d <EOS> i think maybe if you he <EOS> like if you want to go from <EOS> oh , ok i understand . <EOS> you take take the remote , so <EOS> and you can turn like that to change the channel ? <EOS> i think it's quite easy to so s zapping , <EOS> but maybe it will be too fast . <EOS>
uh the next question the next question . <EOS> oh my god . <EOS> otherwise we have two results in one question . <EOS> it's different . <EOS> okay , <EOS> next question . <EOS> it's easy to use , as well for younger as elderl elderly people . <EOS> for young people i think it's easy to use . <EOS>
use them like that . <EOS> pedro's right . <EOS> pedro's right . <EOS> oh wel <EOS> new ideas f uh for the product or for the the the the environment or <EOS> what are we ta <EOS> well let's do both then . <EOS> uh for the product ? <EOS>
okay , so <EOS> we'd have this . <EOS> is that okay ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i think it's probably better . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> but maybe we can make a a plastic , <EOS> so that you i if you like drop it , it won't change the volume . only if you use your finger . <EOS>
it would just detract from the attractiveness of the of the whole feature , <EOS> i it's not gonna add anything , okay . <EOS> yeah i think i i think it would , yeah . <EOS> okay , can we add in uh an attachment to closing feature ? <EOS>
i think that that's the main factor . <EOS> okay . <EOS> right , okay , we'll that's that's the end of the meeting , then . um . <EOS> okay . <EOS> alright . <EOS> so , uh <EOS> thank you all for coming . <EOS> cool . <EOS>
okay , so <EOS> we have three three two two <EOS> or <EOS> two . <EOS> oh . <EOS> well <EOS> so what are we going to do ? <EOS> okay , <EOS> a three , <EOS> i see . uh <EOS> two and a half . <EOS> three ? no . <EOS>
we did . <EOS> brilliant . <EOS> i am bit disappointed about losing the solar panel <EOS> but it's okay . <EOS> that's everything from me . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> it is a set-back , <EOS> but <EOS> okay , <EOS> do you need the cord back ? <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> um actually um <EOS> you could you could think of um having s a y <EOS> you can have a key which could tell y it could go to the video thing <EOS> but um uh <EOS> yo you you you still can't um <EOS> in that case when it you use that the function should be able to take up the v_c_r_ option <EOS> and you could play it or <EOS> you can also think about having <EOS> like um <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> very democratic . <EOS> no spats , that was good . <EOS> um and the means for like the materials we used , how convenient were they ? <EOS> no . <EOS> like the the pens , the whiteboard , <EOS> i mean we used <EOS> well i'm not a big fan of any microsoft , powerpoint or any of this stuff . <EOS> no no i never touch macs either . <EOS> i just use the unix or the off market , sort of wordperfect and all these other things . <EOS>
sure . <EOS> okay . <EOS> sure . <EOS> yep . <EOS> yeah , cool . <EOS> why don't i get that ? <EOS> hmm . <EOS> screwed in quite tightly . <EOS> uh what did <EOS> uh how did we leave it with speech recognition now ? <EOS> we did we say we were gonna try maybe incorporate it but we hadn't made a definite decision on that ? <EOS> right . <EOS> oh i should also point out that um the you know the kind of final objective of this meeting is to reach a decision on the concepts of the product . <EOS> so um that's kind of the end result hopefully . <EOS>
okay , very good . <EOS> thanks for being here . <EOS> um so let's have a look to the the agenda . <EOS> so , we are going to go through this agenda <EOS> uh and mainly first to uh to make to to be used to the tools uh available in this nice and smart meeting room we have here . <EOS> um then we'll go to uh the plans for project and have general discussions about it . <EOS> so , the goal of this project is to uh developed a new remote control . <EOS> um it should be original , trendy , and also user friendly . <EOS> as usual we will follow the the project method um that we are using in the in our company . <EOS> it is in three step as you know . <EOS> first the functional design . <EOS> the second's a conceptual design , <EOS> and then the detailed design . <EOS> during each step uh of each design we wi you will work uh s separately , individually on uh your specific tasks <EOS> and will m we will meet to um to discuss and take decisions about uh what you've you've you did and what uh we will do next . <EOS> so first , we have to to train ourself with all the um the tools availables in the in this nice meeting room and uh particularly the the white board <EOS> so uh we are going to go through the white board and take some um s some notes or do some drawings . <EOS> so who want to start ? <EOS>
mm 'kay . <EOS> thank you very much . <EOS> that was very useful . <EOS> it's funny to see the drastic difference between those two remotes . um . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> and neither of them were very pretty , you know ? <EOS> no . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i think that could be our selling point . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> oh . mm . <EOS> okay , <EOS> that's it changes things . <EOS> so <EOS> does it make some decision about that ? <EOS> changes . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> that kinda changes the whole situation . <EOS> um <EOS> uh <EOS> well yeah , <EOS> then we have to make some nice features . <EOS> i think uh the thing in the dark is a good way , <EOS> to make it more like a mobile phone . more modern . <EOS>
yeah <EOS> oh it's so horrible . <EOS> love um <EOS> i've seen more urine in this city than ever before , <EOS> i mean <EOS> oh my god . <EOS> seriously ? <EOS> i just came from glasgow <EOS> and i'm um happy to say that there's the there's the same quantity approximately . <EOS> um . <EOS> i w <EOS>
and and how much you do have to keep it moving , <EOS> 'cause i'm conscious that watching t_v_ can be quite a sed sedentary activity . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> but i could market that as a um as a a i was thinking actually a a cost saver down the road , in terms of battery , you know . <EOS>
i didn't read <EOS> it's very fashion . <EOS> i didn't read any <EOS> b <EOS> yeah . yeah okay . <EOS> mm . <EOS> only the numbers , only numbers . uh furthermore nothing . but only the numbers , one to twenty or something . <EOS> that should be cool . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah , that would be some development work . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> m mando . <EOS> banana-mando . <EOS> banana-man <EOS> no this is mm banana-bando , yeah . <EOS> uh then it could be cool yeah . <EOS> banana-mando yeah . <EOS> yeah okay , <EOS> let's go ahead . <EOS>
and then you have on the sides to make it a little bit more three-dimensional , <EOS> you have your channel changing , volume changing buttons and your menu button right here in the middle . <EOS> so , <EOS> that's for your consideration as well , <EOS> plus it's an interesting talking point to have standing up . <EOS> we figured it could stand up like this on your table , if you wanted it to , if i made the bot the bottom flat . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> and i don't think you could really perform any of the remote functions with it . <EOS> 'cause the example that they've given there is good morning coffee machine , good morning jo . <EOS> it might be useful to say like where are you remote . here i am , jo . <EOS> but i think that's maybe as far as that one could go ? <EOS>
so , <EOS> the general outline of uh new project will be we first uh go through a functional design phase . um <EOS> you all get uh um certain task uh in this uh in this phase <EOS> and uh then we will meet again <EOS> and uh discuss this functional design . <EOS> and the same holds for the uh
yeah . <EOS> are we going to be supplied with the clay is what i want to know . <EOS> where is the clay ? <EOS> so um <EOS> do <EOS> i think we've got an idea of where we need to go for the next meeting , <EOS> would you say ? <EOS>
i mean we have to look for a trade-off . <EOS> the features and the cost . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i no i i think that uh i if we go for quality people may tolerate for high quality and of course comes with uh reasonable cost . <EOS> maybe not less , but they may be willing to pay little bit more for comfort , <EOS>
s <EOS> but the um <EOS> yeah <EOS> but if you have the near the l_c_d_ you can um choose select between um you know like uni universal between audio , t_v_ and v_c_r_ , <EOS> and this needs a needs a advanced chip . <EOS> transti <EOS> right , matthew ? <EOS>
require lot of requirements , <EOS> but <EOS> yeah . <EOS> for cheap remote control , yeah . and cheap . <EOS> a low cost . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> but uh that's your your job to find something mm matches . <EOS> yeah . yeah , 'cause what i'm thinking is how will you will connect the t_v_ to internet , so . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> what's uh the the th th project is is here to do , is is to to get this this project up and moving , <EOS> ev everybody is is free to uh say wh whatever they want , <EOS> uh everybody has a contribution to make <EOS> and uh everybody feel free to interrupt me at any time to to say what you want to say . <EOS> um in in terms of the immediate meeting the uh um everybody knows everybody else , <EOS> everybody's worked for the the company for a while , <EOS> if if an anybody feels that they need to say more about themselves please do , <EOS> if if if anybody wants to b briefly give their their background <EOS> so that everybody's quite clear what everybody uh uh everybody's experience is <EOS> please do so . uh <EOS> in fact i'd i'd i'd welcome anybody to uh say something briefly about themselves , <EOS> in fact we will do that by by going round the table quickly <EOS> and and saying what what contribution you you're looking to make . <EOS> so we'll start with andrew . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> okay , <EOS> so <EOS> so so for the same price we have four screens now . <EOS> mm . <EOS> okay . <EOS> these technical engineers , huh . <EOS> so , what's the size of the device ? <EOS> ah well this is like this is almost nothing . <EOS> seven to seven to at least well some three millimetres or something . <EOS>
yep . <EOS> yeah , right , that's the point . <EOS> no . <EOS> no . <EOS> no , <EOS> because they can share their ideas across the project , yeah , i would say . <EOS> coffee machines are that made for that . <EOS> yeah , exactly . <EOS>
uh <EOS> this ? <EOS> the olden the olden ones had looked like just a square thing . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah okay . <EOS> but uh i had a lot of pictures <EOS> oh i can show you here what the old ones look like . <EOS> mm . <EOS>
it doesn't make a difference , if you put the s uh the switch channels on side of each other or on top of each other . <EOS> because you already have the volume here , <EOS> so <EOS> you can also put it here one butt and the other one there . next to each other . back and forth . <EOS> so you can also can put it all on the top , <EOS> and this , you keep this empty . <EOS> because you have to hold it as well . <EOS>
so <EOS> everybody's okay with the changing covers ? <EOS> yes . <EOS> i think that's a good uh good option . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> changing case covers . <EOS> um i heard our industrial designer talk about uh flat , single and double curved . <EOS> could you explain that a little more ? <EOS>
respect . <EOS> mm . <EOS> okay . <EOS> no uh generally we can we can design a remote which is mainly for people with uh f age from ten to um forty <EOS> and and then we can add on uh specific functional buttons for children as well as the elderly people or the people wit with who have nervous problems , yes . <EOS>
uh fruity-like yeah . uh <EOS> we will try to explore these two options <EOS> and <EOS> yeah yeah . <EOS> maybe you could explore the two option . <EOS> mm . yeah , yeah . mm-hmm , mm-hmm . <EOS> could we make a titanium shape ? uh yeah <EOS> at least like we can make banana <EOS> or <EOS>
okay . <EOS> so we're gonna talk for a little while . <EOS> um here are some topics that we might be able to discuss . <EOS> expe our experiences with remote controls um , our first ideas about this new remote , <EOS> anything that you can bring to the table for this project . <EOS> so . <EOS>
and um a small paging function . <EOS> even if you can't do voice recognition for the paging you know just some kind of simple button <EOS> that's just a i guess another infrared signal to the remote control <EOS> and while <EOS> to emit some kind of paging . just a beep . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> but basically just the same . although what what uh suddenly came into my head is , you know how they always take two a_a_ batteries which which is really not very efficient at all . <EOS> could it be possible to have uh , you know , like a rechargeable internal battery , like , well , like an m_p_ three player does ? with that you could jus or a mobile phone or whatever . <EOS> you could you know , you just plug into a power source for a couple of hours , <EOS> and then it's recharged for ages and ages and ages , <EOS> and you don't have to worry with replacing a_a_ batteries , <EOS> which are <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> we were a bit off task . <EOS> um so uh i can't think of any <EOS> so we'll have to like <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah i dunno . <EOS> you could make the touch pad in th in different shapes , <EOS> but then that kind of re-designs the whole project like , <EOS> but you could do like <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> uh . components to use , <EOS> i'm not exactly sure what i will use for the design of the circuit . <EOS> it depends uh on whether we will use the l_c_d_ and mainly the speech recognition , <EOS> because the speech rec <EOS> yeah ? <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yep . <EOS> yes yes . <EOS> and this size here , i'd suggest this be small , like quite small . <EOS> yeah <EOS> i know we're gonna have like rubber buttons <EOS> that feel kind of <EOS> yeah i think so yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> well basi basically <EOS> the um for f for uh <EOS> i mean <EOS> e each manufacturer will have a partic will have a particular command set that uh the t_v_ responds to . <EOS> it's not simply a matter of frequency . <EOS> so um <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS>
right . <EOS> facility , <EOS> although whether or not it happens , or is possible , i don't know , <EOS> but something to look into . <EOS> okay . i think that's um <EOS> well done everybody . <EOS> alright . <EOS> anyone have any uh any questions , <EOS> everyone know what they're doing ? <EOS> 'cause if you don't , you'll i'm sure you'll soon get an e-mail about it . <EOS>
okay , <EOS> can i um i'm actually gonna use the um <EOS> it's gonna cause great technical problems over here . <EOS> i'm actually gonna use the <EOS> f <EOS> they probably clip to you . <EOS> oh yeah , <EOS> they might be movable . <EOS> oh yeah , <EOS> they're all <EOS> they're not connected to anything on the table , <EOS> you just leave 'em on <EOS> and walk around with 'em . <EOS>
well <EOS> when you're talking about gaming and stuff , <EOS> do you think they should have some sort of stick on it , rather than buttons ? <EOS> oh . okay , . <EOS> like uh control pads , you know of games , <EOS> but <EOS> or is that a bit ridiculous ? <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> it might be cool enough . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay , so <EOS> we're gonna go with um type pushbuttons , <EOS> and then supplements , <EOS> how are we gonna do that ? <EOS> yep . uh what do you mean by supplements , exactly ? <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> if we want it to be visible and <EOS> um are all those those one that you showed where they were um s met silver-metallic looking ? <EOS> but those are plastic , right ? <EOS> they're not titanium . <EOS> i kind of like that look . <EOS> uh but , or if it was really <EOS> yeah , for the base <EOS> or if we're going for the retro look , i think , like a really shiny black would be cool . <EOS>
and it's also for the for the children , it's yeah for people not sixteen years . <EOS> but there are more <EOS> yeah . <EOS> safer . <EOS> mm . yeah okay that the target group . <EOS> uh they are responsible enough to have a mobile phone , so also to to deal with their uh remote uh control . yes . <EOS>
of one sort . <EOS> just for the volume , uh . <EOS> mm . <EOS> dep i dunno if it <EOS> depending on the final shape of it , <EOS> 'cause you could have like , i dunno , it looks like you can c control the volume with your thumb , <EOS> and then you could control the buttons with your fingers . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> because that's a it's something extra , <EOS> it's something other remotes don't have , <EOS> which we can get a great advantage point . <EOS> so <EOS> and then you can make them with colour . black and grey , other colours as well . <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
yeah , it could be whatever , <EOS> as long as there's something big in the middle , <EOS> because like the old phones , there's like that just like piece of metal or like a picture or something in the middle . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> well , my issue with that is if it got too big though , <EOS> 'cause if you have the circle and the button in the middle , then is it gonna get wider than your your hands are , <EOS> because w and then would the buttons be too small if it was enough to fit on it ? <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> or make it on a hand dynamo , <EOS> but i don't think that will work . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> ma make it with wood instead of rubber ? <EOS> no , <EOS> that's <EOS> no . <EOS> make it w uh <EOS> when you made it uh uh uh a remote control of wood ? <EOS>
plastic . <EOS> uh wood , rubber ? <EOS> rubber , because we're gonna have the soft buttons . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> uh but , yes but <EOS> i think uh that is uh f for rubbers that is uh yeah case material . <EOS> that's just for the case material , <EOS> so special colours though , we having that , <EOS> right ? <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> to use <EOS> yeah . yeah , that's cool . <EOS> so <EOS> if you put in uh speech recognition , you need so more uh many more buttons . <EOS> which won't look good on the front side i think . <EOS> okay . <EOS> no . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> department , yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> sure . <EOS> mm . <EOS> right . <EOS> i think it will be too much of an effort for a person to <EOS> for a phone maybe he might walk down the street , <EOS> but for a remote he will just refer to the manual and all that . <EOS>
i'll be the vanna . <EOS> right . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> that's nice . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> good . <EOS> um and then at the bottom we have our logo . <EOS> um bright yellow sort of design with the r_r_ which will actually look like our logo . <EOS> and then on the side you have the buttons . <EOS> they're one button , but they kind of push up and down . <EOS>
and we got these large <EOS> zoom opt ah yeah of course , <EOS> yeah . <EOS> you can make it larger to to uh to uh with accompanying uh greater fields to push the button . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> and we won't include a a pen , or something to point , <EOS> hey , <EOS> we we want to do it with our fingers , <EOS> right ? <EOS>
okay . <EOS> so uh , if you could open the powerpoint presentation . <EOS> i'm number two . <EOS> you're number two . <EOS> 'kay <EOS> components design , <EOS> there we go . <EOS> so uh can we put it in slide show mode ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> um . <EOS> well that's not very neat , but <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i mean i think uh <EOS> and i think the handhe i think the handheld part is definitely <EOS> so you could make that into the fruit and vegetable part . <EOS>
yes . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> but anyway it would ha i i i it has to have some kind of of symbols , text or something so that people kn <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yes . <EOS> yeah we can <EOS> symbols on it . mm-hmm , mm-hmm . <EOS>
oh , <EOS> good point . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay , <EOS> now we're moving on to market . marketing . <EOS> should i plug that in ? <EOS> is that going on ? okay . <EOS> maybe it's just not <EOS> is it on ? <EOS>
'kay . <EOS> okay , right . <EOS> we're gonna practice with the pens <EOS> and draw our favourite animal on the white board , <EOS> i'll go first , <EOS> and um sum up the characteristics of that animal . <EOS> so <EOS> oops . <EOS> okay , i'll leave space for everyone else . um <EOS> what's missing ? <EOS> we're running out of blue . <EOS> okay . <EOS> i'm not gonna ask you to guess , <EOS> i'm going to tell you that's supposed to be a tiger . <EOS>
so <EOS> if we <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i don't think it's uh <EOS> yeah , <EOS> we should have the ten percent on the on the top , <EOS> then you're you're <EOS> reachable . <EOS> yeah , the ten percent on the top , yeah . <EOS> that that's a good one . <EOS> um uh page two . <EOS> remote controls are often lost somewhere in the room . <EOS> that's exactly what we said about um maybe a home station for uh for it uh to uh recharge the batteries or something . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> mm b <EOS> but a coffee machine , there's not too many words they'd be using with that it's a it's a small vocabulary . <EOS> yeah <EOS> you you won't be using it , <EOS> so it's a limited vocabulary mm thing , and very isolated word <EOS> and it's uh it is interesting , and basically storing the channel through voice or other ways of programming your keys , on the display for the browsing <EOS> which is again <EOS> and maybe having something like a blinking thing , <EOS> like uh it could indicate you're uh it it could indicate what is cal like the uh whether uh you you have enough battery in your in your uh remote , the blinking . <EOS> at the same time , if it's a dark room , it can be used to locate the remote also <EOS> or <EOS>
and the costs within the budget ? <EOS> not the original budget , but they are now . <EOS> is the project evaluated ? <EOS> mm i think so yeah , <EOS> then celebration as it says . <EOS> hooray . <EOS> free coke provided at the cafeteria . <EOS> okay . <EOS>
no . <EOS> 'kay . can we get started <EOS> or is there some pressing issue ? <EOS> no <EOS> what was it about ? <EOS> hmm . <EOS> yeah my computer is not functioning properly . <EOS> oh no pressing . <EOS> did you plug in the power cable when you come back ? <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> oh , i see what you mean . <EOS> i think so . <EOS> so scroll buttons on the side and then buttons on top ? <EOS> yeah , i like that . <EOS> 'kay . <EOS> but we definitely <EOS> if we have scroll things on the side , we definitely have to have 'em labelled . <EOS>
like uh oh wait <EOS> so push button and integrated scroll wheel push <EOS> okay . <EOS> 'kay . <EOS> so i reckon we've got one button for this thing 'cause it's just one big sheet of rubber . <EOS> uh-huh . <EOS> i'm not sure if that counts but <EOS>
non-technically challenged people are gonna use it . <EOS> i mean they want something user-friendly , so <EOS> mm well , even if we kept the regular standard size of remote , if we reduced the buttons down to the ones that people are saying that they use the most often and a couple extra , <EOS> 'cause they're saying they only use ten per cent of them , <EOS> then we should be able to accommodate fairly decent sized buttons . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> right . <EOS> mm , yeah . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> and that's the sort of thing , once you get the mould set , you can just whip out different colours , different pictures very very quickly . <EOS> yeah , yeah , exactly , exactly . <EOS>
uh-huh , that's like the l_c_d_ one , <EOS> is it ? <EOS> but the one below that has got like a little scroll function on the side . <EOS> but i presume that the functions must come up on the t_v_ screen . <EOS> yeah , presumably . <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
mm-hmm . okay . <EOS> just don't interfere with other devices like <EOS> 'cause like all these people do that their lights are turning on with clapping . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> oh <EOS> that's e that already exists <EOS> okay okay . <EOS> oh yeah , you do have . <EOS> wow . you're trendy . <EOS>
for the <EOS> yeah . <EOS> fifteen dollars ? <EOS> ah it's above it's above the budget . <EOS> the cost would be le reduced . <EOS> yeah <EOS> the and the the production costs we we can achieve uh about ten dollars . <EOS> mm . <EOS> hmm . <EOS>
good point . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> and if we had a sc an on-screen um kind of thing that you could scroll through , like you can use your buttons to scroll through things . <EOS> i think that <EOS> yeah . <EOS> for channel surfing i think a scroll an actual like an ipod's kind of scroll thing would be too fast , <EOS> i dunno . <EOS>
that's right . that's right . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm mm-hmm . <EOS> uh it's more like , means there are different speech technologies which are existing <EOS> so d_t_w_ could be kind of which is the easiest . <EOS> so you have to store some templates on the on the on the chip itself , <EOS> and it's just dynamic time warping where you try to find out what it is , <EOS> instead of having a model which has to be trained and being a micro-controller . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> so we have five minutes to <EOS> ah w w we have sometimes to use the white-board . <EOS> five minutes . <EOS> ah you can y you can you can use it if you so , can we <EOS> and another interesting idea for this would be to have an light adaptation system depending upon the picture of <EOS>
no i i see it . <EOS> yeah , it does look like a cat . <EOS> no , i kne i knew . <EOS> no , it looks like a cat . <EOS> i love cats because they're independent , uh they pretty much know what they want , they get it , they move on . <EOS>
i think that's a pretty handy feature . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i think it's kind of people would find that worth it even if it wasn't uh a recharging station , even if they didn't have to buy extra batteries , you know . <EOS> mm-hmm , mm-hmm , <EOS> mm-hmm , mm-hmm . <EOS>
. <EOS> mm . mm . <EOS> yeah th <EOS> right . yes . <EOS> um . but as for the fruits and vegetable patterns , i don't know if we really want to go with that , <EOS> because it is just a trend , <EOS> and our product we want to stay around for much longer than just a few months , <EOS> because <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i mean that could just be a spring thing right now . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> so <EOS> my method for um designing the yeah the work design uh yeah first the <EOS> the main point is that i would wish to to make a really functional product . <EOS> i would prefer to have very functional um capabilities rather than fancy stuff that in fact is not used and doesn't work . <EOS> so <EOS> for that <EOS> yeah <EOS> as it's important to take into account the user requirements from the marketing uh expert uh anna <EOS> and um
yeah , <EOS> maybe the teletext tel <EOS> yeah , text button , <EOS> maybe there and there . <EOS> and then the colour buttons , if we want it on . <EOS> i don't find it very usable , <EOS> but it's <EOS> uh i don't think it's fits in the the modern theme as well . <EOS>
brilliant . <EOS> it can really combat its enemies , even like it it's a it's an herbivore but , uh , it can really defend itself . <EOS> mm . <EOS> very nice . <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> right . <EOS> right , <EOS> i'm gonna take minutes <EOS> while , um , you guys express your favourite animals . <EOS>
don't know if the cable's gonna be long enough . <EOS> i think i just kicked over whatever it runs on underneath as well . <EOS> uh sorry , <EOS> i have . <EOS> brian , this one also i . yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> i can turn my computer quickly if that's okay . <EOS>
oh actually well . <EOS> that th that's true . <EOS> mm . <EOS> it it is it is is is it gives a protec it's more robust that way . uh yeah . <EOS> and you have very good chances <EOS> mm-hmm . mm-hmm . yes . yes , <EOS> more robust . <EOS> yes okay . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> not just pointing out on it . <EOS> it's the same for the presenta for the presentations . <EOS> you can do it from here . that's much easier than standing there . <EOS> and so you've <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , and p just point with a mouse . <EOS>
ach . <EOS> oh yeah . <EOS> well <EOS> i'm gonna paint in the red . <EOS> ooph . <EOS> oh . <EOS> that's the background colour . <EOS> well , <EOS> undo . <EOS> um <EOS> the pen ? no . <EOS> one minute please . <EOS> yeah , that's the one . well , five . <EOS> okay . <EOS>
very good . <EOS> okay , so maybe if we go on to evaluation cri criteria <EOS> and then we'll there <EOS> i suspect we're gonna have a couple of minor finance issues , <EOS> but um we'll se i'm sure we can get around them somehow . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> okay . <EOS>
mm-hmm , um especially if we try to sell , what two million of them . <EOS> oh sorry , <EOS> four million of 'em , <EOS> but uh i think if w if we market it as as not as not <EOS> well <EOS> this you c you could either market it as the point of view we could have the two <EOS> we could have parallel marketing s schemes <EOS> where you've got one where it appeals to people that want to have the new device that looks cool , is fashionable <EOS> and like you just <EOS> it's it's like uh it's one that rather than ra i wan i want rather than a kind of a need relationship with the device , <EOS> but that might <EOS> considering the act what the device is for and the nature of some people might not like respond to having a device that they just looks nice , <EOS> therefore they want it <EOS> so make it practical at the same time . <EOS> i think it's this is gonna have to appeal to people that want device that can enhance their living room <EOS> uh but also a device that uh <EOS>
is there another battery there ? <EOS> oh yeah . <EOS> you got a second ? <EOS> try a <EOS> well <EOS> we won't be able to tell . <EOS> yes , <EOS> it it has a mm . <EOS> perfect . <EOS> is that working ? <EOS> did it come out ? <EOS> good . okay . <EOS> because we'll be able to see it still even if it wasn't working , <EOS> it's just a normal whiteboard marker <EOS> but it wouldn't be picked up on the the actual whiteboard . <EOS>
yeah , <EOS> i don't know . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i think if w my opinion . if we just uh take the ipod , and the same look . <EOS> so uh light or just whatever colour , but the same light colours . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> alright . <EOS> um then i don't see any reason to prolong it <EOS> and f we should finish this meeting at ni right now <EOS> and go into other things . <EOS> alright , <EOS> so this is the end of the first meeting . <EOS> thank you all . <EOS>
so we will depart . <EOS> we will stay here and uh and break off . <EOS> and i'll do minutes <EOS> and and we'll see you in half and hour . <EOS> okay . right s <EOS> okay , that's great . <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay cheers . <EOS>
hmm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , i'd i'd certainly support that idea . <EOS> and so on that you can , just much in the same way as an existing sky remote , scroll along , scroll up and down . <EOS> and uh and i definitely support uh the use of plastic and or rubber . <EOS> i mean titanium would be great , <EOS> but i think it might be a bit too expensive and too kinda spacey . <EOS>
that's for this basis function <EOS> and if you want more you pay more . <EOS> yeah yeah , <EOS> for example the l_c_d_ , you can take it you can put it put it back in , or you can use the other one , <EOS> or the speech recogniser with the microphone yeah yeah . <EOS> you want a microphone to put in the speech recogniser you don't wan you pay less for the system you see . <EOS> so <EOS>
now i'm not saying we should have , you know , tomato shaped remote controls or anything , <EOS> but i think it is possible maybe to use um natural colours , <EOS> like if wood is an option , that whole organic , sleek , clean , <EOS> mm . <EOS>
okay well <EOS> maybe , if i can interrupt you , <EOS> maybe i should uh should show some points on which we uh should take a decision . <EOS> sure . <EOS> so we can discuss these points . <EOS> those points um energy question mark . how how should we uh supply the thing with energy <EOS> and how <EOS> are we going to do it with separate docking station <EOS> and then put in it . <EOS> uh chip on print and case . <EOS> those are points my uh coach advised me to discuss here , <EOS> but i hope you have ideas about them . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> mm . mm . mm . mm . <EOS> yes . okay . <EOS> um . okay . <EOS> thank you . <EOS> well <EOS> it to du <EOS> it's just you had to change the frequencies . <EOS> the frequencies ? <EOS> yeah yeah . of course yeah <EOS> in the chip you have it <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> watch sky <EOS> and yeah . <EOS> yeah , yeah , <EOS> and that would be really annoying . <EOS> alright . <EOS> yeah , that's <EOS> right . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> but that's definitely a possibility . <EOS> yeah but m but on the other hand , remote control isn't as close to you you probably might just just uh speak into it <EOS> and and the t_v_ would be already further away , so it might not pick up the other things coming from there . <EOS>
hmm . <EOS> okay , so <EOS> these were the basic findings from today . <EOS> the last three bullets have been integrated from uh the last minute uh email . <EOS> uh i just quickly jotted them down . <EOS> um so <EOS> basically uh the <EOS> as i told you the identification of how the remote control works and what are the various parts to it uh and what are the different processes um and how the parts uh communicate with each other . <EOS> um okay , <EOS> so e the mee email said that teletext is now outdated , <EOS> so we need to do away with that functionality of the remote control . <EOS> um <EOS> also uh the remote control should be used only for television , <EOS> because incorporating other features um makes it more comp complex . <EOS> and the reason why teletext is outdated because uh of internet and uh the availability of internet over television . <EOS> how however , our our remote control would only be dealing uh with the the use for television , in order to keep things simple . <EOS> um <EOS> also the management wants that um our design should be unique <EOS> uh it <EOS> so it should incorporate um colour and the slogan uh that our company um has it as its standard . <EOS> okay , so he he here is a functional overview of the remote control . <EOS> um <EOS> there's basically an energy source at the heart uh which feeds into the chip and the user interface . <EOS> the user interf interface communicates with the chip , <EOS> so i'll basic go over to the <EOS> okay . <EOS> so <EOS> if uh if this is our energy source and this is a cell , uh it communicates uh it feeds energy into the into the chip , which basically finds out h uh how how to do everything . <EOS> there is a user interface here . <EOS> so whe when the user presses a button , it feeds into the chip <EOS> and the chip then generates a response <EOS> and takes the response to an infrared terminal , <EOS> um which then <EOS> so the output of the chip is an infrared bit code , <EOS> which is then communicated to the remote site , <EOS> which h has an infrared receiver . <EOS> um the there can be uh a bulb here or something to indicate whether the remote is on or communicating . <EOS> um <EOS> so these are the essent <EOS> so a all the functionality of the remote control , <EOS> whatever new functions that we need to do , um make the chip more complicated uh and bigger , basically . <EOS>
well i dunno . <EOS> you'd spend so much time like squishing it to your own personal hand . <EOS> then you'd get a new one and you'd have to do it all over again . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> no but it does it automatically . <EOS> does it automatically ? <EOS> i don't know . <EOS>
try uh flipping the screen down . <EOS> 'kay . <EOS> oh , <EOS> i get to do it , too . <EOS> yeah . it's you guys . yeah . <EOS> so um , you know i mean , luckily we chose a nice simple shape . <EOS> um and further instructions will be sent by your personal coaches . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> ah , but in my instructions i think it said i was supposed to go to the board and do something . <EOS> no ? <EOS> well , there is a production evaluation . <EOS> is that you ? <EOS> yeah , that's me . <EOS> but that's after the financing . <EOS> see ? fi see ? <EOS>
no , the colours are uh it's perfect , yeah . <EOS> it's perfect , and <EOS> true . <EOS> uh yeah , another thing is the logo is missing still . <EOS> i p is th y <EOS> the the yellow ball thing that <EOS> yeah , but the colour , i think the colour is more is most important , <EOS> because i i don't think you have ever seen something like that before for a remote control . <EOS>
yeah <EOS> yeah . <EOS> uh maybe you can do it from your computer so talk us through it . <EOS> . okay . okay . <EOS> um if you all go stand around uh <EOS> yeah . <EOS> just <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> computer <EOS> sure . <EOS>
your fault . <EOS> ciao . <EOS> bye bye . <EOS> bye bye . <EOS>
ah t look all the market potential , what uh how we should design consu our remote controls , what they should be there so as to en enhance our profit , enhance our sales . <EOS> yeah , these are different age group persons <EOS> like uh <EOS> sorry , <EOS> i can open it in another way . <EOS>
it does make sense from maybe the design point of view <EOS> 'cause you have more complicated characters like european languages , then you need more buttons . <EOS> yeah , yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so , possibly . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> and then a and then al the other thing international is on top of the price . <EOS> i'm thinking the price might might appeal to a certain market in one region , whereas in another it'll be different , so <EOS>
are we going one on ? <EOS> i'd say we go two , <EOS> 'cause like f the fanciest would be the double curved . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> w <EOS> maybe you'd be a bit too <EOS> yeah . there we go . yeah , <EOS> that's m <EOS> wouldn't it ? <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> but does it <EOS> yeah . <EOS> only what happened to the single curve we spoke about last meeting ? <EOS> now uh <EOS> the single curved idea was uh <EOS> it uh oh it's in the background . oh . <EOS> yeah , okay , <EOS> you ge um <EOS>
where is it ? <EOS> red . <EOS> i need to open mine . not the agenda . <EOS> agenda three . <EOS> mm . <EOS> no <EOS> that th <EOS> i want the minutes from the previous minutes . <EOS> that should be there , minutes . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay . uh <EOS> from meeting three , <EOS> is it alright with you if i don't switch it to show , just use it as is ? <EOS> 'cause this way i can more easily flip it . <EOS>
i just thought that these two remotes were pretty boring , <EOS> um i dunno if this will work but <EOS> and i think we can find something that's more fun to look at and use than either of those . <EOS> just i mean i like the one on the right better , just because it does have fewer buttons , <EOS> uh but i mean i think we sh can sort of think about things like um like colour and you know size , shapes , that sort of thing , to best fit the user . <EOS>
i don't know what this is but it's really really annoying . <EOS> so <EOS> uh brian , have you have you finished ? <EOS> uh mine needs also this . <EOS> uh-huh . <EOS> um i have , yes . <EOS> huh ? <EOS> at last mine is also the presentation . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> so without l_c_d_ i just take it five ? <EOS> six . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> w uh <EOS> or you want it to be six ? <EOS> um six . <EOS> i think it's the same . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yes as you say , with better uh <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
alright . <EOS> you're looking at the technical functions design , <EOS> and for you it's the user requirements specification , <EOS> like you said at the start . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> okay ? <EOS> okay . <EOS> thank you . <EOS> thanks for that . <EOS> uh i'll see you in half an hour . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> mm . <EOS> okay . <EOS> so <EOS> we need to calculate the production cost . <EOS> as i said in the first meeting we need to have so a remote control that would cost not more than twelve and point fifty euros . <EOS> and if not if it's not the case y you would have to redesign it . <EOS> so , just have a look at the okay here is the <EOS>
yeah <EOS> like like you have a visual of the of the brightness with with a kind of sliding bar and a bus and and stuff like that for sound and and vis and and visuals ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so is you should have a menu for all the the functions you don't use regular and which are <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so um unless anybody's got anything they'd like to add , we can maybe round this up slightly earlier than we'd need to <EOS> and then we can finish up the writing and such . <EOS> and i can get my bus . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> well , um because <EOS> well , i i'm not sure if we should go so far in the whole fruit thing , <EOS> because i think we should maybe just take the inspiration from the fruit <EOS> and uh because what <EOS> yeah , <EOS> w i think wh wha would <EOS> we're trying to get to twenty five , thirty five year olds who want it quite trendy as well they said . <EOS> they wanted something that looks fancy <EOS> and i think maybe fruit could be a bit of a too much of a gimmick , <EOS> but something ergonomically shaped and organic , like good to hold , based on fruits and natural things like that , <EOS> because al already we're going a bit gaudy with the yellow , you know . <EOS> i mean we could make it nice pale yellow . <EOS>
ooh . <EOS> i forget her name . <EOS> right <EOS> it's gonna be a really funny dog , 'cause i'm not sure how to draw a dog . <EOS> tara <EOS> or tara . <EOS> well there are loads of different types of dogs , so i'm sure it'll represent one kind of dog . <EOS>
and uh what's your comments about uh <EOS> um well , i mean , <EOS> maybe if i go through my presentation , you can sort of see what the user perspective is , and how it ties into the other two comments . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> so you are finish , ed , <EOS> uh so i can uh <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> first thing is uh teletext is a well known feature of televisions <EOS> but it's it's getting used less and less . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> that's that's especially because of the internet of course . <EOS> so we should think about it um . <EOS> do we include it , and do we give it a prominent uh prominent uh place on on on the on well huh
we didn't have a whiteboard . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> and no internet . <EOS> oh that's true . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> no , yeah , that's a good point . <EOS> 'cause i'd forgotten that that wasn't our decision , yeah . <EOS>
and uh then we will uh discuss if we have few ideas <EOS> and we will uh end uh by uh dispatching the different task you will be you will have to fulfil to complete this process . <EOS> so <EOS> uh . just one thing . <EOS> uh , you said twenty-five minutes , <EOS> but i have something else to do uh , so gotta have another meeting uh soon , <EOS> so maybe you could hurry up a bit <EOS>
nah . <EOS> p yeah . <EOS> so here are options for our power sources . <EOS> you can use a basic battery , which we've already discussed , <EOS> um th our tech department also said we have the option of doing some kind of hand dynamo where maybe you crank it or something like that . <EOS> i don't know if that's really <EOS> i don't know we got some qu crazy guys down there in that department so <EOS>
yep . <EOS> decided on our our target group being fifteen to thirty five , <EOS> and we decided that it was gonna be non-rechargeable battery-powered , <EOS> that we're gonna group our audio-visual and other functions into into those categories , um . <EOS> and i told you guys about the three new requirements about ignoring teletext , ignoring everything except the t_v_ , and trying to incorporate the the uh corporate colour and slogan . <EOS>
mm yes , <EOS> but i think it's i i it's already there , <EOS> i mean the hard disk uh recorders uh i i've seen them in the shop . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah <EOS> it's <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so <EOS> it's going to record your things <EOS> and you and you you need basically the functionalities what you need in both uh uh video as well as in the standard t_v_ thing . <EOS>
okay , i can start first . <EOS> okay . <EOS> now my slide , please . <EOS> okay , your slides . okay . <EOS> oh , come on , close already . <EOS> and that's number two , right ? <EOS> three . <EOS> three . <EOS> participant three . <EOS> yes . <EOS> okay . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> okay . <EOS> and uh remote controls are bad for <EOS> what is her other side ? <EOS> r_s_i_ <EOS> um <EOS> i dunno . <EOS> other side yeah , yo wa your wrist <EOS> . it i can become painful you can have tendonditis .
so <EOS> that's very common . <EOS> uh it's uh some buttons for for the on off function . <EOS> you d you already told that . <EOS> and for the changing up to the to all the channels and changing the volume . <EOS> that are the the basic options for a remote control . <EOS>
you c can can you can see the the shape of the buttons n is a mushroom , so <EOS> everything's mushroom . <EOS> so we can call our remote control the mushroom . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , everything's mushroom . <EOS> mush <EOS> yeah but it's not like really mushroom because you have uh you know uh like lemon shape , you know , <EOS> centre is yellow and t d <EOS>
um we didn't really look into that <EOS> but remember we found that finding that most people only use about uh ten percent of the buttons , <EOS> i think th th those do tend to be the basic channel-hopping things and on and off for the video , fast-forwarding , so on <EOS> and i think it's sort of general knowledge that people do find programming their videos a nightmare <EOS> . so i don't know if that's something we need to look at .
um . and thirty twenty six percent said remote controls are bad for r_s_i_ . <EOS> i don't know how we'd go about combating that . <EOS> for r_s_i_ ? <EOS> respet repetitive strain injury . <EOS> not enough <EOS> . what do you mean there ? <EOS> okay . <EOS>
um , what other functions ? <EOS> we need <EOS> i'm not sure if we need a design um decision now , <EOS> but we should think about c <EOS> 'cause you've got the dilemma between <EOS> oh batteries , that's what i was thinking about . <EOS> mobile phone batteries , what kinda battery is that ? <EOS>
or is that volume and channel ? <EOS> this and voice recognition . <EOS> okay . <EOS> right . okay . um <EOS> i'm not sure how long we've got left , <EOS> but we need to make a decision about um the things we've discussed . <EOS> so , we agree on <EOS> do we agree on the battery ? <EOS>
i don't know . <EOS> i . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> that's your role . <EOS> well , i think we can have a little discussion about what has to be done <EOS> and what are your ideas about the <EOS> about the design or <EOS> maybe we'll discuss this later , no ? <EOS>
okay , so <EOS> we don't exactly need the single we don't need a curve . <EOS> 's possible to lose curve . <EOS> but w d wha <EOS> no , <EOS> the curve doesn't really <EOS> curved <EOS> then it will be square . <EOS> no , <EOS> then it will won't uh stand up from the table . <EOS> then it would just <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> so a selection of casings . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> 'cause you said about disposable , <EOS> didn't you ? <EOS> it kind of fi it fits with f fits with marketing um <EOS> s s sorry ? <EOS> you said about disposable earli people want disposable things <EOS> so we could do that , like have a choice . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> sure , okay . <EOS> yeah , alright . <EOS> okay , sure . <EOS> what about button shape ? <EOS> square buttons ? <EOS> yeah <EOS> button shape might be a good idea to change , rather than rather than positioning , <EOS> 'cause i think positioning is we're kinda engrained into the the telephone kind of <EOS>
yes , <EOS> shall shall we pull this up ? <EOS> i think that has to come out of there . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm 'kay . <EOS> thanks . <EOS> oh i <EOS> yeah , i thought those last minute things , they're gonna hit you the worst . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> because we need <EOS> yeah . great . <EOS> uh , everything is going t ergonomic , you know , <EOS> there's you know mice for your computers that are very ergonomic <EOS> and keyboards <EOS> and that could be one of our niches p sort of uh uh in the market , i guess . um . <EOS>
and <EOS> yeah okay . <EOS> for the menu . yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> you just adjust it with these two buttons . <EOS> then okay to confirm , <EOS> and then uh on on each on each screen there's there should be an option to go back to a to a upper level . <EOS> and then finally say okay , exit . <EOS> or or one button to exit it . <EOS>
um almost , <EOS> there's one more thing i have to get out of the <EOS> i have to make sure that this attachment will open . <EOS> i keep forgetting whether i've done this . . <EOS> ah-ha . <EOS> okay . <EOS> we'll open that when the time is right . <EOS> in the meantime <EOS> closing things down , <EOS> okay . <EOS> let's see what this thing does . <EOS> does it come up together or disappear one of them or what ? <EOS> ah , <EOS> we came up together , <EOS> we're good . <EOS> okay . <EOS>
i see this a little more smoothly than the last one . <EOS> okay right , let's get started . um <EOS> basically the uh for the <EOS> um i'll back actually . <EOS> for the components design , um next step is <EOS> basically the the way the remote's gonna work is still the same idea as before . <EOS> we still have the user interface which is all the buttons we're gonna incorporate . <EOS> then there is a chip <EOS> and still the sender . <EOS> so um yes including the power s supply as well . <EOS> um i'll go on to my findings in each of these areas . <EOS> uh first in the power supply , we have the option of just the standard battery , <EOS> um . <EOS> there's a dynamo . <EOS> any of you think of kind of like the the old torches which you wind up <EOS> um . <EOS> there's a kinetic option , <EOS> which if any of you've seen those new watches which you kind of you power up by waving around , um it just requires a small amount of movement <EOS> which would mean the batteries wouldn't have to be replaced . <EOS> um that's one option , <EOS> but i think that was gonna cost a little more . <EOS> and then there's solar cells . um as a final option . <EOS> for the buttons , we have um an integrated push button , <EOS> which is <EOS> oh just to say all all these are um supplied by real reaction . <EOS> so i guess for the ease of for quickness and ease we should take them from at least like one of these options . <EOS> um so for the buttons there's an integrated push button , <EOS> which i guess is just the same as the standard ones . <EOS> this says it's uh similar to uh the button on the mouse for a normal for like uh like modern computer . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> doesn't make much make much difference . <EOS> you could work left-handed or right-handed i suppose . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> t the actual thing might be smaller . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> th think about the button as well . <EOS> like either put either one one on either side or <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah , a microphone , yeah . <EOS> so well uh <EOS> type , supplements , <EOS> interface type . <EOS> anything . <EOS> yeah , well <EOS> we already s discussed that , huh , the the l_c_d_ <EOS> and <EOS> the l_c_d_ yeah , <EOS> uh supplements well the supplement is to <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
question number eight . <EOS> will it be easy to learn how to use this remote when brand new ? <EOS> remember that thirty four percent of users usually found it difficult . <EOS> so it has to be <EOS> yeah , <EOS> it's eas they'll pick it up and they'll know what to do . <EOS> the plus thing needs to be worked on . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> um . <EOS> do you do you have this uh information on the web page you said ? <EOS> i have an a web page yes . <EOS> yes , <EOS> mayb maybe you can can send an email to me later uh . yep . yep , sure .
mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah <EOS> but some materials n they're to be uh they're to be something like solid <EOS> like they can't be really spongy <EOS> or <EOS> yeah yeah . <EOS> sure . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> we have to i think we have to have the look of fruit and vegetables <EOS> but we still have to put our chips inside , so of course . <EOS> this is your problem . <EOS> this is not mine . <EOS>
if i'm not wrong . maybe you can uh add it in that . <EOS> yes , <EOS> very good . <EOS> okay , uh <EOS> thank you christine , <EOS> and uh uh any questions or uh clarifications , or any discussion on the functional design ? <EOS> do you have any preconceived ideas in terms of materials ? <EOS> 'cause , for example , in the unbreakable thing , doing something plastic would be harder , <EOS> whereas having something like , i dunno , steel or titanium isn't really economically viable . <EOS>
i never understood how that worked though , <EOS> but yeah . <EOS> yeah , mm . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> and you could just click that to <EOS> so if you had like the menu then you could scroll through and then click it to select . <EOS> mm , oka yeah . yeah . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> and i think that says it all really . <EOS> right . <EOS> see everybody in a half hour . <EOS> i think so too . <EOS> sa <EOS>
mm . <EOS> or i like , you know , the black finish or the silver finish or whatever . <EOS> right . <EOS> okay , my turn . <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> whoo . <EOS> what's the title ? <EOS> it'll be copy of component design . <EOS>
yeah <EOS> but i <EOS> but it is impossible to uh to accommodate uh accommodate uh all the buttons on the s on the difference different televisions sets on one remote control . it's impossible . <EOS> because uh for example sony television uh has the opportunity to s to make uh uh to make it possible for to see on one side of the screen uh teletext , and on the other side uh just n uh regular television . uh <EOS>
right . <EOS> sure . <EOS> mm . <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> right . <EOS> okay . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> right <EOS> okay um well <EOS> let's just go right back to the marketing ideas for a start , <EOS> and just giving an id idea on the time , we've got about fifteen minutes to play with at most . <EOS> so um yeah so just t to bear in mind that the ultimate goal of this meeting is to reach an decision on the the the concepts of the product . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> so you mean that even if these modules will be will be functional uh will be optional . <EOS> yes exa <EOS> what do you think , <EOS> i don't know . you are marketing manag . <EOS> i mean how to how to how to make a marketing survey that uh how many married couple or how many couples have a t_v_ <EOS> or to the number or singles who have a television . <EOS> so based on that i think <EOS>
oh <EOS> wait . <EOS> oh , <EOS> buttons <EOS> oh , so um . so <EOS> the case material will just have one colour , <EOS> right , <EOS> but then the buttons will be in special colours ? <EOS> well , <EOS> does it <EOS> but if we're making multiple varieties of this is where i'm getting confused . <EOS>
something like a two a_ , a_ three size batteries ? <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so and if you want to charge the battery you just put the remote control like that to plug in the the charger <EOS> and uh leave it uh alone , it's alright . <EOS> then the next time you pick it , oh <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> what if we included the batteries in the cover ? <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> oh yeah . i like that . <EOS> that all c also kind of encourages 'em to buy new covers <EOS> and <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
no . <EOS> are you getting it online , <EOS> or is it on sky ? <EOS> yeah , that'd be nice . <EOS> i think i'm gonna start downloading it <EOS> yeah . <EOS> alright . <EOS> think i'm just gonna put down one uh one c_d_ . <EOS> anybody ? <EOS> no ? no ? <EOS> afro beat orchestra , <EOS> very cool . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> fift s <EOS> they like fifteen members from brooklyn . <EOS> um and i'm hoping to go to the concert in belgium , in brussels in april first . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> it's supposed to be in brussels anyways . <EOS> um thing i love about edinburgh <EOS>
me yeah . <EOS> yes . <EOS> yeah , it's functional de yeah , exactly , technical . <EOS> okay . <EOS> so , we looking for a working design when we come back . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> uh working design , yeah , it's it's uh mainly technical-functional design . <EOS>
no , that wouldn't be uh <EOS> yeah , a few variables . <EOS> yeah , well um <EOS> if you look at the um manuals from universal uh remotes , there are maybe um three four hundreds t_v_s at maximum . if you have all of them , all the old and new t_v_s summed up , <EOS> so uh <EOS> i think uh it is possible . <EOS>
yeah , four it's more reasonable . <EOS> you can you can erase with this er yeah . <EOS> ok <EOS> okay . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah , four it's more reasonable , so . <EOS> so as we all agree to accept , under certain conditions , the prototype , we'll have look to the final sh financial view . <EOS>
um , the solar power definitely would be <EOS> but i think just to keep people from getting annoyed , <EOS> 'cause sometimes solar power fails <EOS> and there's no way round that , <EOS> we should install a small backup battery . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> just to cover those moments when for whatever reason , the remote hasn't been exposed to <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so . okay , <EOS> let's see if i can <EOS> i think still though , it shouldn't be that hard to take like just reduce the number of buttons you know , <EOS> like 'cause if you just have like one menu button , that works like with a <EOS>
and furry . <EOS> textile tactile , tactile remote control . <EOS> you're dragging a you have a tail . <EOS> oh my gosh , this is disastrous . <EOS> sorry about that . <EOS> okay . so moving on . <EOS> our selling price goal is twenty five euro <EOS> and profit aim is fifty million euro . <EOS> so i'm guessing that we're not actually in scotland , we're in some european country . <EOS> um , and we will hope to sell this internationally . <EOS>
what do what do you think about <EOS> what componen <EOS> yeah <EOS> we have yeah twelve point five euros uh per uh per r_ s r_c_ <EOS> and i think uh with this <EOS> now you know that chips are very uh cheaps <EOS> and uh we can include it in our control some new new features . <EOS> yeah .
mm-hmm . <EOS> um <EOS> you know , the sound and everything it's just one system . <EOS> but each one's got its own little <EOS> hmm . <EOS> part . <EOS> um okay , <EOS> uh i'd wel <EOS> we're gonna have to wrap up pretty quickly in the next couple of minutes . <EOS> um i'll just check we've nothing else <EOS> . okay . <EOS> um so anything else anybody wants to add about what they don't like about remote controls they've used , <EOS> what they would really like to be part of this new one at all ? <EOS>
m_ d_o_ . <EOS> mm , okay . <EOS> it doesn't it doesn't sound cool for me , <EOS> but maybe for a spanish for i for <EOS> what does it mean ? <EOS> oh . <EOS> what does it mean in spanish ? <EOS> control . <EOS> control . <EOS> okay . <EOS> 'cause it also like in english it sounds like you know the man's tool you know <EOS> because you know men like to have control of the remote <EOS> so it might <EOS>
yeah clear , <EOS> that'd be aye that would be a good idea . <EOS> okay . yeah sure . s so like cur slightly transparent case , so it's yellow , like tinted yellow , but you can maybe see through it . <EOS> is that what you mean ? <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> but uh we want so <EOS> yeah , <EOS> you wou you would <EOS> true . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> but w we we want something th that works all the time , every day , every hour , for everyone . <EOS> yeah <EOS>
okay . <EOS> and of course we should have our image in the in the design . <EOS> so , let's start with the the industrial designer . <EOS> yeah , alright . <EOS> so uh <EOS> . <EOS> or y you can use the whiteboard if you want . <EOS>
okay . um , <EOS> three presentations , i've got written here so <EOS> shall we hear from marketing first ? <EOS> um is it okay if i postpone that til later , <EOS> i just want to get access to a little bit more information , <EOS> is that okay ? <EOS>
well <EOS> that's actually one of the point , <EOS> yeah ? <EOS> true . <EOS> this you will see in my presentation then . <EOS> so i will let you to do your presentation , so . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay . which is participant four . <EOS> so just trying to answer all the questions , <EOS> if the user would be happy to have something or something else uh . <EOS> we've made a study , <EOS> so could you go to next slide . <EOS> sorry for the functional recurrence . <EOS> so that's the standard method for marketing , <EOS> okay . <EOS> we had one hundred subjects , <EOS> um , we observe their remote control use in a lab <EOS> and then after all the experiments they had to fill up a questionnaire , um , <EOS>
it's totally fashionable . <EOS> i'd give it a one . <EOS> it's hot , <EOS> i mean it's a mango , come on . <EOS> mango . <EOS> i mean how fashionable can you make a remote ? <EOS> i think it's bringing technology and fashion together real really well . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> it's not matter so . <EOS> you're going to draw ? <EOS> okay . <EOS> uh it's the same as mine . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> it's a it's a cat . <EOS> what's this ? <EOS> it's a fat cat . <EOS> it is not a fat cat . <EOS>
hi everyone , hope you had a nice lunch . <EOS> um . <EOS> alright we're moving on to conceptual design . <EOS> 'scuse me . <EOS> bless you . <EOS> um , i'll just review what we did in our last meeting . <EOS> um , under marketing we targeted our audience , <EOS> and um , yeah . <EOS>
so to get a good recogni recognising system , it's a costly thing , i think . <EOS> no , it's it's , uh yeah , <EOS> it it's like your recording of uh all uh um a question already , and then you're expecting an answer from th <EOS> for example , you have a t_v_ system , i'm the user and my family members are the user , <EOS> i will already record uh a question like , uh good morning , <EOS> like around eight o'clock i want to see the news in the television . <EOS> so i'll say just good morning and the t_v_ will switch on . <EOS> it will recognise my voice and will switch on . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> are are people really gonna use it though ? um . <EOS> mm , mm . <EOS> i suppose , yeah . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> people are pro <EOS> i would think that people might forget <EOS> i mean people forget to put their cordless phones back on there , <EOS> so . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> it would have to be in the market <EOS> i though w it was gonna make a noise . <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah . alarm , <EOS> but you can't see an alarm inside uh the alarm system itself . <EOS> yeah <EOS> but you still couldn't see it . <EOS> it would just be a little speaker on the back or something . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> okay . <EOS> so maybe one of the things we can just try and include is a really good battery . <EOS> why what kind of light do you want are you thinking of ? <EOS> well <EOS> i mean i'm thinking it might be that for uh this to be a high-tech thing it's gonna have to have something high-tech about it <EOS> and that's gonna take battery power , <EOS> and to make that to make that a realistic goal i think one of the issues that will come up later is , can the battery power it ? <EOS>
mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> um <EOS> i was having a a general outlook on um m most like sophisticated features , <EOS> but voice recognition itself i'm not very sure about , <EOS> because one of the p uh things that cat pointed out was uh uh how do we go about implementing it ? <EOS> uh and uh <EOS>
i think if it's possible you should try to you know have a talk with management about that . <EOS> just you know <EOS> yeah i don't i don't see the logic . <EOS> i i don't see the logic in elimination of teletext , <EOS> i just i i <EOS> but i'm not a tech-mind either . <EOS> i just don't see the cross-over between computers and and and <EOS> 'cause we are designing something for a television , okay . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> okay let us make this l_ and without l_c_d_ . <EOS> on on this scale the l_c_d_ remote control . how do you look how does it look ? <EOS> d is it very fancy or doesn't look much fancy ? <EOS> mm . <EOS> well it doesn't look much fancy <EOS> i'll i'll say three or four . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yep . <EOS> yeah . so <EOS> but it's good to keep in mind . <EOS> mm . <EOS> okay so <EOS> that p ends my presentation . <EOS> mm . very well . <EOS> well . so <EOS> we can always discuss about it <EOS> for example uh the presently the video market actually uh this demand , video over-demand or what we call it as , it's presently booming up actually <EOS> so <EOS> it i <EOS> like people are providing like uh things like uh uh movies , <EOS> you can select actually <EOS> so <EOS> you want to watch a movie and uh your p your provider gives a list of movies , and then you select those list . <EOS> and it <EOS> basically <EOS> you go off , <EOS> it downloads the movie , it gives for you <EOS> and then when you come you want to loo watch it on your t_v_ . <EOS> and thi this is going to come . <EOS>
and the uh industrial design , it is how the object will look like . <EOS> maybe i think uh uh i industrial design's uh , it's the function design . <EOS> i design the user f user interface , <EOS> you design the function . <EOS> yeah . so <EOS> the materi <EOS>
right . <EOS> mm . <EOS> and so they have more space actually <EOS> and uh it's easy to uh use this <EOS> and uh you have <EOS> um so <EOS> this is a standard uh uh infrared eye , <EOS> and then you have a power button , which l volume , what you have , <EOS> and then other than that you have uh channel up and down and uh f slow pause or s slow lo <EOS> yeah s pause or stop , <EOS> and uh then uh you can uh <EOS> you have a l_c_d_ display , here <EOS> and uh y this is a functional thing <EOS> which can change <EOS> like <EOS> it's a toggle switch <EOS> which could change the function <EOS> say , y you press it <EOS>
okay . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> wonderful . <EOS> okay . <EOS> thank you . <EOS> so , let's see what's next in the powerpoint presentation . <EOS> so , i've just thought <EOS> yeah <EOS> i've just thought about this that we could even put it much more professionally as <EOS> there we go . <EOS> okay , so this is the um overall budget for our project . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> so , <EOS> small , stylish , and something that's just a little different . <EOS> a curve , <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> something sort of sort of sl slightly sort of biomorphic in form , <EOS> uh which it would need to be to sort of conform to the shape of the hand more efficiently anyway . <EOS>
yep . okay . yeah . okay . <EOS> yeah , after lunch . right . yep . okay . <EOS> and uh good luck for your arrangement games . <EOS> thank you . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> it's not possible . it's impossible . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> uh <EOS> of increasing the unit price . <EOS> what would be <EOS> so you mean yo you mean we we should target something maybe which is which would be more expensive but re really fancy in terms to um in terms to had to have really an added value ? <EOS> okay , <EOS> so regarding the automatic speech recognition , i think this is <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> younger people like trendy trendy designs , <EOS> so that's w we should make our our our r_c_ as trendy as possible <EOS> but it should also be uh have a reliable image , <EOS> so when it looks too too spacey or too fancy people will think well does it work at all . <EOS> hmm . <EOS>
i'm proud of it . <EOS> okay . <EOS> this is our final meeting , the detailed design meeting . <EOS> and again i'll take minutes . <EOS> the <EOS> what we have to get through in this meeting is firstly the prototype presentation from you two , <EOS> so you can show us what you've been working on so diligently . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> hmm . okay , specifically television . <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> maybe we'll hear differently , <EOS> but for now <EOS> so the joystick is just for differentness . <EOS> mm . <EOS> it would be ease of manipulation of certain functions , yes . um <EOS>
yeah , <EOS> you got a message . <EOS> five minutes , okay . <EOS> so <EOS> just on a side note , why is it my laptop is only giving me a black screen ? <EOS> mm ? <EOS> uh maybe you have to say the magic word . <EOS>
uh , see <EOS> you have to do it real slow . <EOS> 'kay . <EOS> s <EOS> haunted white board . <EOS> so <EOS> we've got the tool uh introduction . <EOS> we <EOS> we're being haunted . <EOS> move along to the project finance . <EOS> um as you can see , we um for our remote control , a selling price is uh twenty five euros . our selling price . <EOS> uh our profit aim is fifty million euros . <EOS> uh that's the least we have to get from our remote controls , <EOS> so we have to work together to reach our aims . <EOS> uh we can do it international , <EOS> so we have to focus on different kind of users , different kind of cultures , and different kind of trends as well . <EOS> um but that's all in the later stadium . <EOS> our production cost um can be maximal twelve and a half euros , <EOS> so that's also a point we have to keep in mind , <EOS> that we won't make remote controls with small televisions inside , and stuff like that . <EOS> it won't work . <EOS> so <EOS> just try to remember these points . selling price twenty five , profit aims fifty million um , but more important is the int international market we're trying to focus on . and production cost uh maximal twelve and a half euros . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> seven , eight , ei eight euros . <EOS> exce except for the for the special shape , the surfing board , it has a quite a a conventional layout of buttons uh . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so <EOS> this one model <EOS> and uh <EOS> yeah . sure . <EOS>
it would be very funny for us . <EOS> uh yeah yeah . <EOS> so bad i don't like it . <EOS> oh . <EOS> okay it's a friendly panther . <EOS> maybe it's happy 'cause it just ate someone . <EOS> yeah maybe . <EOS> um . <EOS> actually , honestly i i i dunno what's what's his it's be behaviour , <EOS> i dunno if if it's the male who who hunts or it's the female uh , <EOS> i i i have watched that lions di didn't hunt it's the the female lions who who hunt , <EOS> so but <EOS> i like it because it's fast , <EOS> and it's black as well , so it can he it can hide itself very easily <EOS> and it's it's <EOS> it looks like um powerful , strong , <EOS> uh i dunno . <EOS> i i watch a a film about a black panther when i was a child <EOS> and i was in that age when everything was shocking me a lot . <EOS> okay . <EOS>
okay , no speech recognition . <EOS> yeah , i think so . <EOS> yeah , that's good . <EOS> yep . <EOS> okay , we just take that one . <EOS> and what else , we have <EOS> also the one in the dark . <EOS> so uh <EOS> it lights up when it's dark ? <EOS> i didn't <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> i'll clear one of these things for you . <EOS> just by moving it yeah . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> i think whatever it is you still need a battery <EOS> 'cause i don't think anybody wants to keep doing one thing . <EOS> okay the other ones are a solar powered cell , <EOS> which may not be a great idea in europe or any country that has seasons 'cause half the year you'd be dead . <EOS>
yeah i think that would be it then . <EOS> no . <EOS> so we we can go for <EOS> i have no idea . <EOS> you didn't put it in ? or <EOS> that w . <EOS> let me check . <EOS> it's not really english . <EOS> i know . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> how did where did <EOS> where did you get all your in information ? <EOS> yeah , <EOS> it's in the it's in the folder <EOS> yeah . <EOS> there was uh a website , uh , <EOS> oh . <EOS> technical functions ? <EOS> no . yeah . <EOS>
sounds good . <EOS> and i'd say that that's us for now . <EOS> okay . <EOS> . <EOS>
hmm . <EOS> okay . <EOS> uh so let's talk about our bonuses and the raises we're getting for this , right . <EOS> mm . <EOS> right , right . <EOS> that's it , um i think another couple of days holiday pay might be well in order for all of you . <EOS> uh <EOS>
what's a turbo button ? <EOS> might want to be able to scroll past television stations without seeing what's on them , <EOS> in which case it just waits until you stop scrolling and then , you know , displays that station . <EOS> or they might want to scroll and and have a quick glimpse of it , even if it lags behind what they're doing . <EOS>
yeah . yeah , <EOS> you share a television or something that yeah . <EOS> right . <EOS> but uh still , if if you can go back to that slide <EOS> and uh , how popular was it ? <EOS> oh , oh , okay . <EOS> that's alright , <EOS> if you can just look it up on your computer , <EOS> wh uh um people between twenty five to thirty five , uh how popular was <EOS> so it was sti still still quite popular amongst them . <EOS> so even they are seventy six percent , is that high amount ? <EOS>
or edit . <EOS> the o the obsolete uh details . <EOS> okay . <EOS> so uh <EOS> each individually i individually uh must think on what's uh at uh his point of view is the most important . <EOS> and uh then we're going to fit uh all the pieces together the next meeting . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> i i don't see why not , <EOS> almost everybody is probably used to a console by now , <EOS> and all of them incorporate small keypads on them , <EOS> in fact even the mobile phones these days are beginning to use them as well , <EOS> so it's probably an interface that most people are used to . um <EOS>
yeah , <EOS> you could take it to lectures <EOS> and just write stuff down <EOS> and have it printed out when you got back to the office . <EOS> they great ? <EOS> yeah yeah yeah , <EOS> that's it's it's <EOS> i wonder what one of these costs . <EOS>
yeah . yeah . <EOS> in which case you're going to be l <EOS> but if it has a sort of signal which isn't any sound <EOS> i don't know if it's expensive maybe to <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i don't yeah i mean it but like i mean <EOS> just i mean like your phone even just has so like it can vibrate , it can light up and make noise and i dunno <EOS> .
no uh uh . <EOS> maybe you should draw it very large like this . <EOS> yeah but this part isn't uh functioning properly . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> sensitive . <EOS> oh right . <EOS> how do we uh uh <EOS> or insert text ? <EOS> erase ? <EOS> i dunno . <EOS> maybe just start typing . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> remote control . <EOS> we need something that is international . <EOS> suppose we're we want to sell it in france . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> the recognition system will be able to understand french . <EOS> if you want to go to england , it will be able to understand english , <EOS> so . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah , i think so . <EOS> yeah , so each of us has a role to do . <EOS> yeah <EOS> i think assign your uh roles . <EOS> s <EOS> in each <EOS> we already have our role . <EOS> for each for each one . <EOS>
so <EOS> does anyone have any comments or ideas on that ? <EOS> i think you <EOS> uh maybe we yes well we maybe can decide later on um the l the the look and feel <EOS> of uh i've <EOS> it was a good idea maybe to to <EOS> to let the people choose , you mean ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> they're going with the fashion thing , like the design , spongy rubber . yeah . <EOS> the fruit and veg . <EOS> this one . <EOS> yeah , i would s that would be my my feeling . <EOS> mm . i th i think i would largely want to actually steer clear of the whole sort of fruit and veg thing . <EOS>
solar . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> but solar <EOS> and we can , instead of having instead of having , you know , replaceable batteries we'll just have a power cell that stays there for the life of the remote . <EOS> you never have to get go through the go through uh all these different batteries . <EOS> and also you can <EOS> i i think it's a good opportunity for the user design <EOS> or for not just for the user design , but also for the just for the look and feel of the remote as as a whole . <EOS> you know you could have some kind of neat little , you know , a sexy design for d a cradle and the remote itself . <EOS>
um well uh <EOS> i said i'm the project manager <EOS> and uh i'm hoping uh for a good project <EOS> and uh i'd like to hear uh who you are and what your functions are uh on this project . <EOS> let's start with the ladies . <EOS> well uh <EOS> i'm uh <EOS> and my uh function is user interface design , i think . <EOS> so uh <EOS> that's me . <EOS>
uh-huh . <EOS> uh that's the little menu key . <EOS> this is the infra-red section <EOS> so you g <EOS> it'll be sending rays <EOS> and if you're you know pointing it like that it can send it , <EOS> or if you hold it up like that it'll send it . <EOS> uh we got a microphone there which for all the voice commands <EOS> so you can you know talk to it like that <EOS> and it'll still understand . <EOS> um the logo is down down there um <EOS> and has the cover on it <EOS> and you can see like it just kinda goes <EOS> the red bit's the cover <EOS> and it kinda goes over everything <EOS> and then there's holes for the buttons to come through . um . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> if <EOS> i mean that was the the directive that came through from management , <EOS> but if we had a a decent case for that we really think it's important to include video and d_v_d_ , i could get back to them and see . <EOS> it's w it's just whether it's worth arguing about . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> okay . <EOS> right . <EOS> um , having a look at the existing products , i found out that um it tends to come in sort of two extremes , <EOS> there's either um a very complicated one that's got lots of buttons , lots of colours , very confusing , you don't know what you're doing . <EOS> um in that case the the labelling tends to be very bad . <EOS> um there's an example i'll show you at the end , <EOS> um sh show you now . <EOS> uh <EOS> here um the button there and there . <EOS> this one's prog . <EOS> sorry . <EOS> that one's perg and that one's prog , <EOS> and it doesn't really tell you what it does . <EOS>
they want us to decide what form of energy are we going to use , <EOS> which the choices that we've discussed were pretty much battery , kinetic or solar . <EOS> um this is where kate's expertise comes in , <EOS> and our decision making will be a little bit guided by kate at this point . <EOS> the <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> mm . <EOS> so actually it is there but it's just not r ready there . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> but s <EOS> directly available . <EOS> so does it confuse uh the user ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> you'll have to search for it . <EOS> they'd have to be easy to use . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> but like mobile phones have screens and they're cheap . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah , yeah . yeah that's true . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i mean , we have to remember our budget is twelve point twelve fifty for to actually make the device . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yes and to give us more liberty to have a fancy look so <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so let's go back to our laboratory and <EOS> to improve on the design . <EOS> so . <EOS> what a what what about the sys speech recognition ? <EOS>
it's already changed for <EOS> i think it would be simpler . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> okay . so i will close the meeting , <EOS> um just after that we'll have lunch break . <EOS> and you will have in thirty minutes individual work . <EOS> uh y you <EOS> you will have as the i_d_ i don't remember what is industr industrial designer to put um pon <EOS> yeah , <EOS> and the user interface designer to work on the user interface concept . <EOS>
right . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> right . <EOS> i think it would be possible to uh combine the locator device and the voice recognition technology . <EOS> mm . <EOS> oh . <EOS> that could work . i like that . <EOS> with a simple command like locate . <EOS> and then it could start to beep <EOS> and <EOS>
i'd say a single . <EOS> single . <EOS> single sounds good , <EOS> 'cause it's not big enough to really constitute a double . <EOS> single . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> right . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> it's only actually the size of my hand . <EOS> alright <EOS> what's next in our agenda ? <EOS>
yes . <EOS> so the the advanced chip on print is what um what we've we've deci we've determined <EOS> and the uh engineering industrial design is the recommendation , <EOS> and um i think we've kinda come to some agreement regarding um this concept of a wooden case . <EOS>
how far away is your television ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> it's never gonna be more than it's never gonna be , you kno unless you've got a t_v_ the size of a football pitch , it's not doesn't have to go that far , <EOS> does it ? <EOS> doesn't have to go through a wall , because you're not gonna be looking through a wall . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> well well <EOS> m m maybe m maybe we can give the uh the uh the case a very uh uh normal a v very normal case but , with the changeable covers to fancy it up . <EOS> so like a normal cheap plastic case which can be covered up in , for instance , a wooden case . <EOS>
yeah yeah . so , <EOS> thank you . <EOS> uh d did you uh work out cord ? <EOS> so do cats . and you guessed cats without a tail . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> i think i will go without without it , <EOS> right ? <EOS>
yeah , yeah . <EOS> oh i see , <EOS> right , um . <EOS> um , well <EOS> as you can see this is just a most superficial layer <EOS> and um it'd be very easy to put another layer of something else like <EOS> okay . <EOS> just veneer really , <EOS> yeah . okay . <EOS>
yeah , you probably are right . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah , that's true . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah , yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> well <EOS> that that's just it with the covers , you're sort of tricking 'em into continuing to spend their money on our products without making 'em feel like they're being ripped off having to buy a new product . <EOS> so , <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
so instead of speaker , . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> 'kay . <EOS> cool . <EOS> that's not a very exciting colour . <EOS> i think you should make it more vegetable-like . <EOS> tha <EOS> which colour , <EOS> the the colour of the phone or the colour of the <EOS>
it's a happy face . <EOS> actually that looked a lot more like a tongue from previous to uh fr some other design uh modifications . <EOS> mm . <EOS> builds . <EOS> mm . <EOS> i hope you appreciate the uh incorporation of some tin foil from a uh random kit-kat bar <EOS> that happened to be consumed . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah , that you don't use half of them . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> there's some remote controls where there's kind of a hidden panel , so all those buttons that you don't really use unless you're programming or something . <EOS> that's useful . <EOS> so you just have like the number buttons , power button , t_v_ video button . <EOS>
yeah , that's basically what it allows you to do , <EOS> right ? <EOS> yeah , <EOS> and it this is just gonna <EOS> all this is being used for is your television . <EOS> yeah , but , i mean , people like <EOS> it would <EOS> that would mean you'd need a television that has bluetooth in it , which no no television does , <EOS> does it ? <EOS>
depending on what is around , like what colour is around , and depending on the temperature , yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> like a chameleon . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah yeah . <EOS> we can make it in fact . <EOS> if if if the <EOS> okay . <EOS>
then i believe each of you have a presentation . <EOS> um i've was sent a a couple more requirements for our remote , <EOS> what they want . <EOS> um then we can come to a conclusion on uh what we want the remote to do , <EOS> um and how it's going to do it hopefully . <EOS> and uh then we'll have the closing . <EOS> um which we'll have forty minutes for . <EOS> uh let's see , <EOS> the last meeting we went over um who was responsible for what . <EOS> i'm responsible for leading the meetings , keeping the notes , uh and coming up with the final presentation . <EOS> um corinne is our marketing expert . <EOS> she's gonna figure out what what um the consumer wants . <EOS> um ryan is our user interface designer . <EOS> and manuel is the industrial designer . <EOS> so you're gonna come up with the ideas ryan , <EOS> and you're gonna pick 'em apart . <EOS> um we decided our remote , <EOS> uh we want it to be a universal remote <EOS> uh that everyone would want . <EOS>
well if if we're going down that then we can we don't need to go the <EOS> it it strikes me that the locator feature might actually be uh quite expensive to make . <EOS> whereas actually just putting it in a power cradle might not be too expensive at all <EOS> because that's just done with mobile phones <EOS> you can just n we we have said we have actually similar products that we can take from and potentially cut costs there . <EOS>
hello . <EOS> hey guys . <EOS> hi . <EOS> i see my bunny is still standing . <EOS> no one drawing it . <EOS> uh i figured uh that much . <EOS> hi . <EOS> hi . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> it's too beautiful . <EOS> yeah , true . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> ach , that is <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay we'll s we'll say two point five . <EOS> okay um <EOS> so we have it within cost anyway . <EOS> maybe closer to three even or two and a half . <EOS> okay . <EOS> um so yeah <EOS> project evaluation is this point . <EOS> um . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> so if you have questions . <EOS> you can have a look . <EOS> very good , let's have a look . <EOS> test it out . <EOS> . <EOS> uh it's a sort of intermediate colour , i guess . <EOS> yeah , oh , we hold the remote . <EOS> oh , but it it does feel all cold and slimy . <EOS> i hate play-do , <EOS> it's just minging . <EOS> but yeah , uh that's cool , cool . <EOS>
it's also to gets to know each other <EOS> because um i'm asking three things , uh for that uh drawing , <EOS> to do it on a blank sheet , <EOS> with different colours <EOS> and i just showed you how to pick a colour , <EOS> and also with different pen widths <EOS> which i also showed you . <EOS> um and a favourite characteristic can be just uh one word . <EOS> well <EOS> i'm not very good at drawing , <EOS> but i will uh go first <EOS>
everywhere around the room especially here for your face , of course , <EOS> and this isn't a pie , <EOS> it's a a set of microphones <EOS> and there are microphones here also . <EOS> but please uh don't be afraid of them . <EOS> well <EOS> they won't hurt you . <EOS>
hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> sounds good . <EOS> yeah , something . <EOS> okay . <EOS> well , uh let me set this up . <EOS> so i plug it in , press f_ five ? <EOS> function f_ five ? <EOS> function f_ eight for the um the uh <EOS>
yeah , <EOS> but good usability , <EOS> so you can use it . <EOS> okay , <EOS> i told about the home station . <EOS> uh it must be simple , <EOS> because uh our the the elderly people uh needs to use it . <EOS> and i i found a motto . <EOS> and we put the fashion in electronics . <EOS> and that's uh the motto we are uh referenced to uh for our uh our style . <EOS> we we have to make a a new product . <EOS> we have to be um yeah . one of a kind , i think . <EOS>
no no . <EOS> as a watch ? <EOS> mm 'kay . <EOS> yeah they are not simple . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> one thing i just thought about when you were saying that , is that the p our target market is gonna be someone who has lost or broken <EOS> we gotta stop ? <EOS> who's lost or broken their their remote . <EOS> so how many remotes do they wanna buy ? <EOS> can we p can we sell them a remote that can maybe guarantee they will not need to buy another one ? <EOS> and so with with with this kind of system or locator or something , to to think about , how have people been been losing or breaking their remote ? <EOS> how does this happen ? <EOS>
everything ar <EOS> uh for a remote control , does he have all the <EOS> you know . <EOS> mm everything <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> it's compared to the all <EOS> you could expect . <EOS> that's right . <EOS> that's right . <EOS> remote controls . <EOS>
so now is the final evaluation , final evaluation of the uh uh of our product . <EOS> how we are going to <EOS> means uh at what standard what standard <EOS> whether it meets our standards or not . <EOS> how mu <EOS> what rating we will give to these products . <EOS> so of course this is will be a team work , <EOS> w we together have to decide wha what rating we will give to this product and everything . <EOS> so what methodology i will tell you on what basis we are going to discuss all this . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> so <EOS> okay , <EOS> we are alread mm . mm . <EOS> okay . <EOS> so <EOS> you know now the basic the basic things . <EOS> and yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> l <EOS> well just just for the next meeting , um <EOS> well , uh , you wor yes , work on a design , <EOS> keep it general , <EOS> i mean so w we will be still fle flexible with maybe adding some functions . <EOS> so <EOS>
well , that's good . <EOS> that's what we kind of predicted anyway . <EOS> mm . <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay , the spongy , not real spongy , <EOS> you can <EOS> do you think like rubber would be good or does it really want to be like gel kind of stuff ? <EOS>
mm-hmm , <EOS> mm-hmm , <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> yeah . <EOS> and o on the topic of the technology , it just occurred to me that we actually didn't need to move our computers because each computer has all of the files . <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
which i which is hamed , ? <EOS> okay . <EOS> read about <EOS> yeah . mm . <EOS> he's the industrial designer ? <EOS> no , you're the industrial designer . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> uh i am the technical designer , <EOS> i dunno which one , uh v . <EOS>
uh . i'll search um . <EOS> if you want to use teletext , you can push the teletext button and then the options uh become available . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> that's a <EOS> the sign of it . <EOS> okay , <EOS> but no more buttons or functions , <EOS> or ? <EOS>
yeah . yeah . <EOS> just want to have something controller which is in a kind of intelligent controller , easy to use , sophisticated and fancy . <EOS> yeah <EOS> but if if you stick to um <EOS> you think it's possible ? <EOS> stick to the first two parts . so what's the difference between our controller with other products in the market ? <EOS> there's no k features of our controller , <EOS> so is there is there any necessary to design new controller without any breakthrough features ? <EOS>
i thought it might be a cat . <EOS> yeah <EOS> well origi uh <EOS> at first i thought it was going to be cat . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> i don't think it's furry enough , <EOS> so we'll make it a fluffy rabbit . <EOS> yeah now i now i understand now , yeah . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> you can touch options <EOS> and it's comes out . <EOS> a two , okay , <EOS> because we have to <EOS> yep . <EOS> a two , a two . <EOS> the uh the um below . <EOS> it's the box below it , <EOS> huh ? <EOS>
any of you use of remote control for a television or d_v_d_ or something ? <EOS> you're both nodding , <EOS> all three . <EOS> that that that's the sorta product we're talking about , one that will work for a in a home environment , for a t_v_s and <EOS>
mm . <EOS> um well , there are different kinds of dogs , but okay um . <EOS> that's not bad at all . <EOS> yep . <EOS> ah <EOS> it looks like a dog . <EOS> okay . <EOS> is a bit more impressive than my rabbit . <EOS> i think it needs four legs if it's gonna walk though . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> mm . <EOS> uh-huh . <EOS> okay . <EOS> um <EOS> the only advantage i was thinking of to having the buttons , like the buttons on one side for the channel , and then the slider is that if you're just holding in your hand , and you pick it up , it's easy to n s know , okay , this is just the volume and this is the channel . <EOS>
i find that in the dark it's often hard to know what button you're pushing . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> so what's something we could , uh , do to remedy that ? <EOS> okay . um <EOS> i always find that in our house the remote control always goes missing . it's always , where is the remote control ? <EOS> so maybe if you could have some kind of <EOS>
are you a mac person ? <EOS> huh . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> which isn't very user-friendly though . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> well the problem is if you don't like my new computer never has wordperfect so i have to go track someone down who has an old disk and then i have to reinstall it . <EOS> so i have all these documents i can't use now . <EOS>
no no . no no , <EOS> we have t we have to change the end cost . <EOS> there's uh i mean i don't see it anyway . <EOS> we we well do we necessarily have to change the end cost because uh can we dl can we do that without uh changing it twelve-fifty per product , if we basically can sell more based on this ? <EOS>
mm , mm-hmm . <EOS> yes . <EOS> that's right , yeah . now that's a good point . yeah . <EOS> so yeah . <EOS> yes . <EOS> and uh display clock i if you want more features then we can display a clock <EOS> it i i don't think it will take any money extra money because anyway we have an integrated circuit i think we can just definitely fit that feature into the circuit so it's <EOS>
like a dual kind of . <EOS> mm . <EOS> so that affects the exterior design . <EOS> solar would be slightly expensives . <EOS> expensive as well . <EOS> what kind of price are we looking at for <EOS> i presume the normal batteries are the cheapest ? <EOS> they're they're expensive , <EOS> they don't <EOS>
i dunno . <EOS> y <EOS> yeah . <EOS> cool . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> y i if you the numbers could be can be <EOS> yeah , that's right . <EOS> uh you can just make them around the buttons uh <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> or it runs the whole <EOS>
um circuit boards . <EOS> um yeah , <EOS> i got a whole bunch of information on how circuit boards are produced . <EOS> they're they're thin fibreglass with copper wires etched on to them , <EOS> and di i think they're quite easily printed on by machine , <EOS> which is chip on print is where the machine prints on the wires and solders it all together for us . <EOS> i don't really know what to tell you as far as decisions . <EOS> i wasn't really given any options , <EOS> i was just given that this is how they're done . <EOS>
have to be really careful . <EOS> fish and chips . <EOS> okay , <EOS> it's your turn . <EOS> ah it's my turn . <EOS> oh . <EOS> okay , <EOS> be careful . <EOS> okay . so . <EOS> it's ok <EOS> so , <EOS> what can i draw some more ? <EOS>
i'd <EOS> yeah i liked it , <EOS> yeah . <EOS> leadership . as much as can be leadered in this uh thing . <EOS> very good . <EOS> i li <EOS> yeah , <EOS> top marks . <EOS> um last one we've got is room for creativity . <EOS> now , <EOS> i think we got <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> now <EOS> the early adopters , those of us who grew up with technology and uh luck lucky for us have the uh cash to to pay for it , <EOS> the young age group without the mortgages and responsibilities , ninety one percent of them would pay more for speech recognition in a remote control . <EOS> very interesting , <EOS> i i leave this up to the group to decide if we wanna use this uh if and you know , the the designers , <EOS> but ninety one percent , fifteen to twenty five <EOS>
right . i agree , <EOS> it's either gonna be bigger with a base or smaller with just <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so we sh <EOS> smaller , without <EOS> yeah . <EOS> a battery like this guy . <EOS> alright , so what direction do you want to go in ? <EOS> you wanna vote ? <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> that was that was me . <EOS> i think w i think they're both sort of just like general remo they're both general remotes . <EOS> and uh <EOS> oh really . <EOS> 'cause that that is something we have to decide , is whether we want to have v_c_r_ capabilities . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah , no . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> alright . <EOS> okay , we're gonna wrap this up now . um the costs are within the budget , <EOS> we evaluated the project , <EOS> and now we're gonna complete the final questionnaire and meeting summary , <EOS> and then we're going to have a big giant party , apparently , according to this , so . <EOS> alright , thank you team , <EOS> you did a great job , <EOS> it was lovely working with you . <EOS>
select . uh . but , would you have the screen on the thing , or would you have it on the telly transmitting the screen . <EOS> that's something we could decide . mm . <EOS> because <EOS> i guess they would go together somehow ? i dunno . <EOS>
then these are the <EOS> this is the market . <EOS> um sixty percent of the market consists of users between the ages sixteen and forty f six . <EOS> um main characteristic of this group is that they're very critical on the remote control . <EOS> um they like to use new f new functions . <EOS> but they also are very critical . <EOS> they won't spend their money very easily . <EOS> so um <EOS> the users of forty six to sixty five years cons the make up forty percent of the market . <EOS> they are not really very interested in features . <EOS> but they do tend to spend their money a lot easier . <EOS>
yeah , yeah . <EOS> yeah <EOS> i understand what you mean . yeah . <EOS> i think it's <EOS> i think it's easy to implement a button with a s s what which especially do that , <EOS> because some t_v_s , if you press the t one and then the two , it be between five secs it make twelve , <EOS> and that's that's not relaxed <EOS>
you could um <EOS> we could hook it up . <EOS> oh . <EOS> it wouldn't copy onto the the thing 'cause it's black , <EOS> but all the different age groups have different desires for speech recognition . <EOS> so basically older people don't really care . <EOS> it's really the people twenty five to thirty five . <EOS> i feel those are the people that really watch a lot of t_v_ though . <EOS> they're the ones that get addicted to soap operas and <EOS>
ah <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay , i'll for industrial design . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> and and you norman ? <EOS> mm ? <EOS> um working on i . user interface . <EOS> user . <EOS> and <EOS> and <EOS> uh , i'm into marketing . <EOS> yeah <EOS> nothing much in the project . <EOS>
yes . just so one battery . 'kay . <EOS> electronics . <EOS> given speech recognition i think w you should go for the less fancy chip . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> uh sample speaker , yeah . <EOS> yeah , yes , <EOS> or sample sensor , yes . <EOS>
even still there's gonna be interf th there's there still will be interference from the t_v_ . it might not be it might not be completely confusing , <EOS> but i think you'll still y it's still <EOS> i don't think it's practical at all . <EOS> i think it's a bad idea frankly . <EOS>
besides look at what the l_c_d_ does to our lovely remote . <EOS> back to the design room boys . <EOS> so we can just take away a heck of a lot of the <EOS> there you go . <EOS> . <EOS> central ? <EOS> oh that's just <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
'kay . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> um <EOS> i'm not sure . <EOS> i had i've had some market information , <EOS> but not from the company , no . <EOS> right . <EOS> right , okay , <EOS> so basically time to market seems to be important , <EOS> therefore speed of delivery . <EOS> we've only got about another four hours left . <EOS>
text . <EOS> yes . <EOS> text that we can have on the case itself , <EOS> we can <EOS> it will be printed on the case and symbols as well as the buttons . yeah . <EOS> yes . <EOS> that's right . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> okay , yeah just wanted make sure of that mm-hmm . <EOS>
it doesn't ? <EOS> smells quite nice . <EOS> smells very sweet . <EOS> it does . <EOS> mm . <EOS> right , so we have to complete the final questionnaire and meeting summary when they send it . <EOS> i don't know if it's already sent or not . <EOS> um presumably i have to <EOS>
so <EOS> we have to uh make buttons for that as well , <EOS> to make it uh <EOS> no . <EOS> i i uh <EOS> the chip um uh is producing the pattern . <EOS> so we have to make a chip that produces patterns to , y you know , to <EOS> yeah . <EOS> that are working . <EOS>
yeah , <EOS> but how many buttons do we need ? <EOS> uh what about a <EOS> okay , so <EOS> so we have this . <EOS> we have a a basis um , <EOS> how do you call it ? <EOS> so <EOS> the base station . <EOS> a base station . <EOS> we'll have a base station extra uh on the side . <EOS>
that comes with the l_c_d_ ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> we decided , <EOS> 'cause it's not on our list . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> oh so so the the this is <EOS> mm . <EOS> the scroll wheel is on the side . <EOS> . so <EOS> we're adding costs for right , okay <EOS> uh i mean i think this is good . <EOS>
good . <EOS> thanks . <EOS> yeah , and that's fine . <EOS> is it okay ? <EOS> alri <EOS> okay . so , basically , <EOS> the method that we usually use in the user interface design is that we need to look at what people like and what people don't like about existing products . <EOS> so , in our case , existing remote controls . <EOS> and then , what the good ideas are , <EOS> and what the bad ideas are , <EOS> and why they're bad and good , <EOS> which isn't always as obvious . <EOS> we seem to have intuitions about why things are good or things are bad , <EOS> but when you look , technically , at how it works , sometimes that's not the case . <EOS> then we need to decide what functionalities we really want to keep , <EOS> 'cause that'll feed into both ed's work and christine's work . <EOS> um and then what the remote control should look like , <EOS> obviously , once we've got a good idea of what the functionalities are . <EOS> so , <EOS> in terms of the functionalities that we need , you obviously need to be able to turn the t_v_ on and off . <EOS> you need to change channels , both by directly going to a specific channel or by channel surfing . <EOS> you need to be able to control the volume <EOS> and then control any menus on the t_v_ to regulate contrast or whatever . <EOS> so , <EOS> the problems that people have expressed is that there's too many buttons on remote controls , in general . <EOS> the buttons it's not clear what they're supposed to do . <EOS> um often , you need to know specific button sequences to get certain functionalities done , <EOS> um which you don't necessarily always remember , especially if it's a functionality that you don't use very often . <EOS> and that the buttons are too small . <EOS>
okay um , <EOS> welcome to our detailed design meeting . <EOS> i'm pretty excited . <EOS> let's start <EOS> it's approximately fifteen forty or something like that . <EOS> okay um <EOS> the agenda <EOS> we're gonna do an opening <EOS> and then um i'll talk about the minutes from the last meeting , what we d discussed um , <EOS> then we'll have the prototype presentation <EOS> and a look at the evaluation criteria . <EOS> we'll look at the finances <EOS> and finally a do a production evaluation <EOS> and close . <EOS> so , <EOS> starting off with the um last the last one , <EOS> oh <EOS> i don't have it here um , <EOS> but we talked about energy , <EOS> we're gonna use a kinetic battery um , <EOS> we want to use a simple chip , <EOS> because we're not gonna need a a shuffle um , <EOS> we're gonna need a scroll um , <EOS> we're choosing a latex case w in fruity colours that's curved <EOS> and um we're using push buttons uh with a supplement of an on-screen menu . <EOS> and it sounded like we had set um like eight or nine buttons , including five pre-set channels . <EOS> okay ? <EOS> let's do the look and feel design presentation first . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm 'kay . <EOS> hmm . yeah . <EOS> right . <EOS> cool . <EOS> any questions ? <EOS> do we have um other , for lack of a better word , skins ? covers ? <EOS> in play now <EOS> or are those ones gonna be developed later once we see how the couple we have g go or ? <EOS>
highly . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . but <EOS> but he also said that we should not only focus on the younger people , <EOS> but also on the older , <EOS> and will they use it if it only has an l_c_d_ screen ? <EOS> yeah , <EOS> but <EOS> um , <EOS> s <EOS> forty six to forty five , thirty three percent , <EOS> and sixty fifty six to sixty five twelve percent . <EOS> but our our our what's it , project requirements are the new products should be reached for new markets , to customers that are younger than forty . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah , yeah . <EOS> so <EOS> okay uh do you know what , <EOS> actually let's take each point and everybody discuss it , i think . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so still on the topic of room for creativity uh next up is craig . <EOS>
yep . <EOS> yeah , that that one is single curve , <EOS> isn't it ? <EOS> um do we have <EOS> what does double curved mean , i don't understand . <EOS> and that's <EOS> i i think you it means you reverse the curve . <EOS> uh that's the the one that goes like this . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> i don't think there was anything <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i'm actually not sure if i've saved my presentations . <EOS> yeah ? <EOS> mm . <EOS> they'll probably still be there . <EOS> uh me too . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> new ideas found . <EOS> i don't really know what that means . <EOS>
ah . <EOS> and um well i i will present my my first idea on how to build the our new remote control for television . <EOS> so uh can you go one page down , please . <EOS> so i think the first things to do is to define the hardware components neededs to achieve uh what we want to do . <EOS> so uh mm i'm thin uh <EOS> i think uh i i'll do a survey about what is uh what is available on the market <EOS> and what what is the the cheapest possible things we hav we can use . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> that's costly though . <EOS> um a much easier thing is just any loud noise like clapping um , shouting , you know , <EOS> uh and then , what would the response be ? it beeps back at you or something ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> so uh this is the circuit board . <EOS> the green one is a circuit board . <EOS> actually , uh building a circuit bo board is pretty pretty uh easy and also it's a it's a l l inexpensive . <EOS> uh it's it costs less than what you print on a paper , <EOS> because uh uh when you when you are building uh some circuits some um uh circuits and also wires , it's it's better to go for printing , <EOS> because uh you can build these kind of k circuit boards on a on a bulk and it's just printing , nothing like uh , you know , you don't need to use wires and all . <EOS> it's not exactly wires we are using . <EOS> it's just printing something on a board . <EOS> tha tho those prints will acti act as wires and ci uh circuits . <EOS>
it con it controls the speed ? <EOS> yeah , <EOS> so with this turbo button you can , say , skip over t channels if uh , you know , if i'm if i'm going if i'm scrolling past them <EOS> and you know , it's um , you could have a little red light that comes up when they press it so they feel you know it's really going fast or whatever . <EOS>
scrolling <EOS> i don't know . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> because people li seem <EOS> now the ipod's out people seem to like this thing that there's no <EOS> mm . <EOS> know you don't have one two three four five <EOS> yeah , yeah . <EOS> i think that's an interesting idea , 'cause it's cool , <EOS> it's it's funny like you f like i just <EOS> i don't have an ipod but like i , you know , i just like started messing around with one of my friend's the other day , <EOS> and you just sort of and <EOS> it's funny how you pick it up and you just figure out how to use it quite easily , <EOS> like it's not that hard , you know . <EOS>
there's there's not much specific specific information , <EOS> but i think that um one indication of infra-red mean that you're just targeting traditional devices . <EOS> because infra-red is something which everybody has . <EOS> w <EOS> okay . <EOS> just to t_v_ , okay . <EOS> okay yeah . <EOS> w well well we've um <EOS> in the new requirement spec they said just to focus on the t_v_ , <EOS> so that's what we should do for now i think . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> w to to we should agree on what are the technical functions uh for this remote control <EOS> and i show you the the working design . <EOS> so um basically uh <EOS> here is a really large view of what we want . <EOS> uh we want an on off button , <EOS> it can be uh <EOS> it's simple <EOS> but it's it's important , and also uh the to both channels as well as other buttons that come after , <EOS> right . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> we're just working the three phases . <EOS> yeah okay . we'll do our best . okay . <EOS> better make it <EOS> okay . <EOS> i am gonna work on the conceptual design already 'cause yeah it's fairly important to know what kind of components we want to put in . <EOS> do we <EOS> i mean , is it gonna be a multimedia control centre ? <EOS> do we want to be able to use the video recorder with it ? <EOS>
in which folder ? <EOS> where did you put it ? <EOS> here . <EOS> here . <EOS> short-cut to ami shared folder ? <EOS> mm . <EOS> but it's not <EOS> um . <EOS> maybe you can send it to me by email . <EOS> just to participant one . <EOS> at ami . <EOS>
'kay . <EOS> added extras would be nice , <EOS> but the primary consideration is to get the project finished within uh this short time window , <EOS> which effectively now is sort of four hours . <EOS> so and if <EOS> and we've gotta get to the end . <EOS> uh d d i think i think first and foremost we've gotta get to the end <EOS> and then get to the end with um added extras if possible . <EOS>
no , <EOS> we said teletext also a separate menu . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> but i <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> but <EOS> okay , <EOS> but we can work that out later , i guess . <EOS> so <EOS> we're having a a general menu with the most used functions , uh teletext , screen settings , audio settings , channel settings , <EOS> and maybe there are options for the remote itself ? like uh large icons or small icons <EOS> and <EOS>
um i'd like to if possible hear from our marketing expert first , <EOS> to help us gain an idea of where we're going to go . <EOS> so um <EOS> i'll just load up your presentation from here if you want . <EOS> 'kay . <EOS> sure . <EOS> um , sh would you like to <EOS> i'll just do it from here . <EOS>
alright . <EOS> i'm gonna let you guys talk before we make decisions . <EOS> and does anyone really want to go first ? <EOS> i guess i'll go first . <EOS> you p two ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> what's <EOS> component , i think . yeah . <EOS> components design . <EOS>
you're in four ? <EOS> the four gives me it's gotta be uh trendwatch . <EOS> trendwatch . <EOS> is this the same one you did before ? <EOS> no . <EOS> okay . <EOS> it shouldn't be <EOS> if it's not it's not the right one . <EOS> no , no we g no , that's the same one . <EOS> you have to go back and find another one . <EOS>
hmm . <EOS> okay . <EOS> good morning everybody . <EOS> um i'm glad you could all come . <EOS> i'm really excited to start this team . <EOS> um i'm just gonna have a little powerpoint presentation for us , for our kick-off meeting . <EOS> my name is rose lindgren . <EOS> i i'll be the project manager . <EOS> um our agenda today is we are gonna do a little opening <EOS> and then i'm gonna talk a little bit about the project , <EOS> then we'll move into acquaintance such as getting to know each other a little bit , including a tool training exercise . <EOS> and then we'll move into the project plan , <EOS> do a little discussion <EOS> and close , <EOS> since we only have twenty five minutes . <EOS>
or titanium . <EOS> they cost us all the same . <EOS> mm-hmm or titanium . <EOS> remote control . <EOS> uh just <EOS> well we only have one button so really we shouldn't be charged , <EOS> we shouldn't be charged anything for the the button supplements . <EOS> no <EOS> that's getting a bit <EOS> tiny . <EOS>
right . <EOS> okay . <EOS> well , if we're trying to keep it slee sleek and sexy as well , have you seen those remotes where kind of um the bottom bit slides down , so there's kind of um everything else revealed ? <EOS> so you don't use it that much , <EOS> you don't have to see it all the time . <EOS> but it's all there if you need it . <EOS>
yeah , <EOS> y yellow incorporated , yeah . <EOS> or at least incorporating , yeah . <EOS> yellow , okay . um . <EOS> i mean i forgot i we're sort of uh <EOS> i don't know what other standard silver kind of <EOS> i think <EOS> mm . <EOS>
user-friendly . <EOS> and it needs to be open to a wide range of consumers , <EOS> so even though we need a small number of buttons , we also need to take in like are most people going to be using it for a d_v_d_ player , a tivo , what what exactly are we using it for , <EOS> as well as the age range . <EOS> so we need a hip , but not a corny marketing scheme for promoting our product . <EOS>
sure . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i did . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i mean fruit and squishiness . how c more creative can you get ? <EOS> sponginess . <EOS> the prototype making was very creatively stimulating <EOS> and i think we've come up with a product that's fun and meets all the criteria . <EOS>
okay yeah . yeah yeah . <EOS> ah , okay . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> and the other one is for the teletext or something you want to browse through from that . actually . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> okay so <EOS> it's it's t a very basic remote then , <EOS> it's only <EOS>
for what ? <EOS> uh power button . <EOS> i think a button . <EOS> a button is better . <EOS> i think it should be a bu <EOS> ah oh yeah , yeah . <EOS> yeah a button , yeah i guess so . <EOS> if it if it's a button or <EOS> okay . <EOS>
jirun ? <EOS> okay , i agree , <EOS> but i think it's very important <EOS> that they always um make the same buttons accessible , <EOS> so use just for special options a part of the touch screen . <EOS> yeah , of course . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
uh speech recognition , i think , <EOS> so we need a microphone presumably . <EOS> okay <EOS> uh i could put the microphone here . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> okay there's the microphone . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> where should i put the microphone ? <EOS> i mean ho h h wel <EOS> are we sure that scroll wheel does give ease of use ? <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> that increases the the cost also . <EOS> uh that's right . <EOS> but uh means we have to see how much what kind of microphones and stuff like that . <EOS> do you think that performance of such systems are enough to to target well of such technologies is enough ? <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah , but this is good because it's not a long long life product . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> t_v_ is more like fifteen years , maybe , so . <EOS> yeah , yeah . that's a yeah , yeah . <EOS> if you have a lemon lemon t_v_ for <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yep . hmm . <EOS> right . <EOS> um <EOS> so uh <EOS> oh <EOS> i just have one question . <EOS> so <EOS> are we doing just the television <EOS> or are we doing <EOS> so not d_v_d_ players , <EOS> we <EOS> okay , okay . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> we should have confidence in technology . <EOS> yeah , we should . uh . <EOS> hmm . so , <EOS> what do you think ? <EOS> we'll try the controllers you'd prefer . <EOS> mm . <EOS> what ? <EOS> which kind of controller would you prefer to use , you as a remote control user ? <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> did we decide on the rubber case ? <EOS> the spongy feel , <EOS> or did we think that that might go as a trend ? <EOS> well , it was different last year . <EOS> the trend was different last year apparently . <EOS> it was not not spongy feel . <EOS> but <EOS> i don't know whether the trend will change . <EOS> i don't know whether it's one of those things that like sort of having all fruit shaped keys , that that probably would go out of fashion very quickly , <EOS>
the l_c_d_ . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> but i mean like i i the black and white , i guess , it just doesn't look funky enough . <EOS> um but , i mean , like even mobile phones or whatever have now have colour l_c_d_ screens , <EOS> w i ju i mean <EOS> i wouldn't know about the costs of them . <EOS>
uh-huh . <EOS> uh both of them , <EOS> so so <EOS> for example in some country where you are in the the countryside and you are far from , you know , the cities uh for example in some place in in s senegal , so if you have electric if you have solar alimentation , you just , when you want to have recharger or remote control power you just put it on the sun and after one hour you can come <EOS> and so it can be interesting for people to have this kind of remote con it can be something interesting to make people buy it , for example . <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
no . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> but i think that it it might be to see whether people actually all come up with the same thing . <EOS> oh right . <EOS> given certain information or <EOS> yeah , like if everyone's given the same input <EOS> i don't have a clue , anyway . <EOS> um what's next ? <EOS> looks like <EOS> oh no that's not um <EOS>
mm . <EOS> is that a lizard ? <EOS> no way . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> wow . <EOS> it's a gecko . <EOS> ah , a gecko , okay . <EOS> is a ar are they also like lizards or are they <EOS> yeah , they are <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> so is the agenda ? <EOS> opening , acquaintance , tool training and project plan , discussion and then closing . <EOS> project aim is a new remote control . <EOS> it's original , uh trendy and it's user-friendly . <EOS> project method , functional design , individual work , another meeting , <EOS> conceptual design , individual work , and a meeting of details design , <EOS> individual work and a meeting . <EOS>
true . <EOS> do your own . <EOS> though i did feel like th the level of information dropped off severely over the course of the day . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i mean maybe it's just me <EOS> but i didn't actually get any information for the last presentation at all . <EOS> nothing , i didn't even get an email , <EOS> like <EOS> that was it . <EOS>
yeah , well well i mean <EOS> my sense on that is sort of what kind of guidance and direction , encouragement <EOS> from like your personal coach person and stuff like that , do you think maybe ? <EOS> yeah from <EOS> and you as well i think , just sort of acting as team leader . <EOS>
so i myself would say a one or a two . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i would say two . personally . <EOS> i w i'd say two i think . <EOS> it's a two ? <EOS> okay , <EOS> and p <EOS> for the <EOS> fanciness . <EOS> fancy <EOS>
y <EOS> 'kay . <EOS> mine will always read copy of something or other . <EOS> i i copied mine before i sent it over . <EOS> sorry ? <EOS> oh okay . <EOS> sorry , <EOS> hang on . <EOS> don't know . <EOS> oh there we go . <EOS>
um i guess you could better y you should look at a a user centred uh approach , <EOS> because the customers have to use them <EOS> and <EOS> and if they don't think it's usable they won't uh buy it . <EOS> a lot of buttons they may think from i don't need s as much as that . <EOS> uh , well <EOS> perf <EOS> personal preferences is is uh a simple remote , with uh the basic functions that you can need that you could use . <EOS> but uh keep in mind the new functions of t_v_ what we discussed earlier , <EOS> split screen and uh is that a function that you should have ? <EOS> because all the t_v_s will have them . <EOS> or because of only a few and isn't really necessary . <EOS> and then uh make it i would make so that you can could uh use it on more than one appliance . <EOS> if you have one that uh uh does with the vi the the video , it could also work with uh with the stereo , <EOS> because play is play and stop stop and that sort of thing . <EOS> the shu c <EOS> you could reuse the buttons <EOS> so that you don't have to have a lot of buttons for uh anything . <EOS> and it should be a user friendly , clear buttons , and not too much . <EOS>
it doesn't look like a banana at all . <EOS> well , you see , i was i was unaware at this point of th of the fruit focus , <EOS> um , so at the moment it's more of a box focus . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> looks like a tr look likes a a tro a tropical fruit . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i know that like people people have like things they can put on their keys that you press it and it'll beep , <EOS> but i but i'm sure that would require some kind of technology <EOS> that <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
so uh user interface controls the chip and accordingly the messages <EOS> like there should be a user user in interface <EOS> like you know switch pad or something like that buttons should be there . <EOS> so uh you can control whatever you want , <EOS> you want to change the channel you want to control the volume you you want to uh mute uh mute the uh t_v_ or you want to have a child lock or you want to do some operations there's a there should be some device to tell what to do to the uh in uh integrated circuit <EOS> so that the integrated circuit can s send the signals and t_v_ can perform the actions . <EOS>
plastic . <EOS> um i guess it's two , since one for the top , one for the bottom . <EOS> is that right or is it just one ? <EOS> n no . <EOS> no that's just one . <EOS> maybe it's one because of the <EOS> it's just one mo single mould , we can do that . <EOS>
i <EOS> okay . <EOS> mm and then <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah <EOS> and find maybe a compromise . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> yes okay . <EOS> perfect yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yep . <EOS> okay <EOS> let's call this to an end . <EOS>
it's good . <EOS> did you um <EOS> were you able to like put yours in the group folder ? <EOS> okay . <EOS> yes , i just did that . <EOS> hopefully it is there for people . <EOS> yeah ? <EOS> yep . <EOS> looks like there are um looks like there's a second one kind of of mine that's that i didn't do , <EOS> it's from like an earlier project , i think so um <EOS>
wa <EOS> can you explain that ? <EOS> like a <EOS> right , okay . <EOS> how <EOS> what kind of <EOS> how l long can you get out of that , <EOS> i mean can you pick it up and then wind it for two minutes and then that's it for the night ? or <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah <EOS> . i don't . <EOS> it's , yeah , it's pretty it's pretty high-tech . <EOS> mm-mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . yeah , <EOS> and it might be too expensive . <EOS> and if the whole idea is you're using a remote then why would you have voice , <EOS> like you know what i mean and then it's like you wouldn't need a remote <EOS> you'd just talk to your t_v_ . <EOS>
easy to find . <EOS> uh easy to find in a room ? <EOS> i lost my banana . <EOS> i think you can't miss it . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah ? <EOS> okay . <EOS> uh . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> i think it's cool . <EOS> i think we can put a six here . <EOS>
yes well <EOS> we will then find out ho how it works . <EOS> yes . <EOS> um . well , <EOS> this seems to me , yes , some computer program <EOS> but i didn't find it yet . <EOS> so , <EOS> we'll come to that later . <EOS> so , uh <EOS> now we will try out the white-board we have here . <EOS> so , <EOS> i would suggest uh <EOS>
okay . <EOS> alright . so <EOS> f_ eight ? <EOS> function , the blue button . next to the control on the left . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> you have to push it together . <EOS> oh , and f_ eight . okay . <EOS> mm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS>
uh-oh . <EOS> s difference between lines and text and the pen . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> oh . <EOS> all i need is mic . <EOS> right . <EOS> and you can't erase this ? <EOS> hmm , strange . <EOS> okay , well uh <EOS> just leave it at this <EOS> and quickly save . <EOS> um and then we are going to the project or product evaluation . <EOS> we just did our project evaluation . <EOS> um well , <EOS> i think i can sit for that <EOS> since it's almost my final slide . um <EOS>
okay . <EOS> sh next slide ? <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah . yeah . <EOS> well more most of the people think that remote controls are ugly , thoroughly . <EOS> so and they they admit that the the they should uh s they would uh spend more money in a fancier remote control , <EOS> which is which is good and it's interesting point . <EOS> also the people are worried about about the r_s_i_ disease , <EOS> which is if you repeat the sa the same movement , which is not a with a not very appropriate device , you you will have problems whe when you will get old . <EOS> so s people are uh are worried about the the shape of the of the remote control . <EOS> they are also <EOS> they get angry very often because they lost the remote control very often , <EOS> so i think it would be a good point to to l to to find a a solution to <EOS> any beep any alarm or something incorporated to with the remote control every time it it get lost . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah and it says menu and it flips open and then you have the buttons to control it , in combination with your <EOS> that's <EOS> but it's it's not <EOS> yeah . exactly . <EOS> it's not very uh very strong uh yeah if you drop it one time . <EOS>
that's true . <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah . that's true . yeah . <EOS> and also what you said . um you can introduce voice recognition by uh finding back your remote . <EOS> but i think it's um more efficient and cheaper to put it in the docking station . <EOS> so you have a but button on your docking station which you can push , and then it starts beeping . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> okay . <EOS> well there's a real idea yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> right . <EOS> yeah , like for mobile phones we have uh different you know covers , like designs and all so that w we can have that . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> no , no . <EOS> uh this one doesn't want to be moved , i think . <EOS> uh . <EOS> too great for email then . <EOS> so , <EOS> next i propose the industrial user interface to present things . <EOS> okay , okay . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> we have , yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> no . <EOS> no , i don't think so . <EOS> not really , no . <EOS> because we keep all the features , <EOS> we keep voice recognition , <EOS> we keep l_c_d_ display . <EOS> we <EOS> instead of having scrolling we we just push the buttons . <EOS> um yeah . <EOS>
wow . <EOS> very official . <EOS> yeah i kinda like this i'm kinda getting into it . <EOS> right . um . so <EOS> just to kick off the meeting <EOS> basically um so <EOS> we're working now for a real reaction , <EOS> this is uh so it <EOS> right . <EOS> just got an agenda to set out what we're gonna try to accomplish in this particular first meeting . um <EOS> we're gonna just do a quick opening <EOS> and we can hopefully all get acquainted with one another <EOS> um then we're gonna start talk a little bit about tool training . <EOS> essentially that means getting used to the only thing that we haven't tried out yet , the whiteboard . <EOS> um we've got a general plan for the project how we're gonna go about accomplishing this <EOS> and then just a bit of discussion close up . <EOS>
y probably not yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> which also makes a base station basically obsolete . <EOS> we don't need that then . <EOS> um <EOS> however <EOS> our interface options are push-buttons . <EOS> in which uh in the production of which or in manufacture of which um our company is expert . <EOS> um <EOS> however we've discussed that scroll wheels are a better option . <EOS> and they are possible . <EOS> we have an okay for scroll wheels . <EOS> okay . um <EOS> however when it comes to the scroll wheel of the ipod i've one big objection and that is that we have to fit an l_c_d_ into the remote control as well . <EOS> this however may exclude certain um materials . <EOS> if you have a squishy uh kind of remote control , then an l_c_d_ screen may be affected by the movement . <EOS> hence we might not be able to put it in there . <EOS> so um <EOS> there's also restrictions to , when it comes to the chip . <EOS> if we have a more sophistic uh sophisticated scroll wheel rather than this very basic uh set-up that we that i've just presented , um the chip has to be more s more sophisticated and thus more expensive as well . <EOS> i don't have any details to , when it comes to the cost but um it will be a significant difference . <EOS> i'd rather say drop the titanium and therefore let's have a more sophisticated chip , <EOS> but that's not up to me to decide really . <EOS> so that's for the for the scroll wheel . <EOS> um it limits our choice <EOS> and squishy is hip , so i'd say rather not go for for that . <EOS> let's see now . <EOS> um um <EOS> solar cells cannot be used on a curved or latex um surface or um remote control . <EOS> but obviously that's not our problem um since we have decided or against solar cells , i assume <EOS> right ? <EOS> or is anybody still <EOS> alright . <EOS>
yeah ? <EOS> so it not not only in in the colours of the leds , that we want something to keep it visible at all times , <EOS> or <EOS> how do you mean ? <EOS> um <EOS> yeah if you if flashing colour so you can't lose it , basically . <EOS>
that's true , <EOS> but are we set on the banana idea ? <EOS> actually <EOS> well it look like <EOS> it looks like you are all targeting that <EOS> yeah ? <EOS> i was thinking that the <EOS> the shape of a banana is not it's not really handy . <EOS>
d <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> oh . <EOS> this one on the one side and one <EOS> yeah . okay . <EOS> uh you could you could as l as like a mouse you could <EOS> ye yeah , <EOS> 'cause i've definitely picked up remotes and like meant to change the channel and turn the volume , or vice versa , <EOS> so it'd be kinda good to have them be feel completely different . <EOS> you'd know what you were fiddling with . <EOS>
complicated <EOS> yeah . <EOS> but but still but still people have the idea this is more functional than a normal uh uh universal . <EOS> r_c_ because it has more uh it it is in some kind universal . yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> but if we're going for the say fifteen to twenty five age group then not many of them would actually own t_v_s to use a remote control on . <EOS>
great . <EOS> me ? <EOS> yeah . miss mar miss marketing ? <EOS> okay . <EOS> not quite sure how this is gonna work . <EOS> there go . <EOS> cool . <EOS> uh <EOS> well i'll try my best to draw . <EOS> can i just draw the face ? <EOS>
integrate . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> okay . <EOS> very good . <EOS> so <EOS> so <EOS> what else ? <EOS> well done . <EOS> i think we we can go <EOS> okay . <EOS> home ? <EOS> happily satisfied . <EOS> home . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> maybe maybe we can hassle the the <EOS>
what do you think about uh incorporating bluetooth or a radio uh receiver uh in the place-holder next to the t_v_ , connected to the t_v_ ? <EOS> yeah , <EOS> actually i have t <EOS> so it's in the wrong product . <EOS> yeah . yeah , <EOS> i actually i figured that would be that would be rather nice , <EOS> but then you'd still have the uh the infrared function . <EOS> so in in theory you'd actually just move the problem , <EOS> but uh what i did uh think about was when you mentioned about the uh the cup-holder , is why not uh introduce a speech function like where is the remote . <EOS> if somebody says , where is the remote , then it goes uh beep uh beep beep beep or something , <EOS> i dunno , <EOS> maybe uh maybe something to look into , <EOS> i dunno uh what the cost that something like that would be . <EOS> but it may be uh may be something to explore . <EOS> uh i'll i'll just explain a bit of the components . <EOS> uh first you have the energy source . <EOS> the energy source would be a battery , simple uh battery <EOS> uh that you can find anywhere . <EOS> i figured that would be best , <EOS> 'cause when the battery uh stops functioning uh we could just uh use you could just go out and buy a new one . <EOS>
i'm dealing with the inside really . so um , yeah i ran out of time so i couldn't do this one as fun as the last one . <EOS> um and uh i found out that most uh controls use some form of infrared to send signals to the t_v_ <EOS> presumably because of the cost issue of uh something like uh the same thing that computers use , wireless <EOS> and , you don't need to send very much information . <EOS> um , most of them are powered by some form of battery . <EOS> now our one , i'm i'm not sure whether we want to look at the size issue <EOS> because most of them are powered by triple a_ batteries <EOS> but those can be quite bulky <EOS> so i d i didn't know if you wanted to look at something else um so we could shrink down the size of the control . <EOS> yeah sure . <EOS>
mm-hmm . if you could uh <EOS> sor <EOS> if you could speed it up a bit , yeah . <EOS> if you could uh speed it up a bit please , yeah . <EOS> sorry . <EOS> cool . <EOS> i'm sorry ? <EOS> sure . <EOS> i'm about to end , yeah . <EOS> i think it's cool <EOS> but there are definitely some considerations . <EOS>
hmm . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> we're als we we're looking at who buys it as well . <EOS> yeah . we can look at that that factor also , so yes . <EOS> uh , which i think the twenty five to thirty five is uh usual , sort of . <EOS>
right . <EOS> yep . <EOS> there might be one other problem with the transmission , <EOS> um in particular right now , since we're talking about voice recognition . <EOS> um if somebody's gonna h talk to the device , you ideally want them to hold it to them . <EOS> i it <EOS> you may not require that , <EOS> but you know , um it's it's <EOS> it's something very natural , i guess , you know , to hold it , to signal to the user , <EOS> and push a button maybe to start s talking about it . <EOS> then you need to send the signal out , <EOS> so because if you're using infra-red , the line of sight um say the t_v_'s at that chair , and i'm standing in front of here and the transmitter is here , it blocks it . <EOS> so in that sense , there's not really a restriction <EOS> but it's something which you may have to think about later on in the process . <EOS> not so much further down . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> i also think that um uh th f the the feel of it is uh , when you hold it , is something that um uh was expressed more in in in in my uh design <EOS> mm-hmm . yeah . <EOS> and that's logical and normal <EOS> 'cause those are the parameters that an industrial designer's more thinking about , th th the look and the feel , <EOS> and uh , you're <EOS>
okay , <EOS> let's do case . <EOS> uh i'm kinda liking the idea of latex , if if spongy is the in thing . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i'm a little um i'm a little hesitant about it , <EOS> because i'm worried about protecting the stuff on the inside . <EOS>
basic battery . <EOS> it's cheap , it's cheerful , it's worked , does work . <EOS> mm . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> cheaper option . <EOS> are you happy with that ? <EOS> okay . so we'll go for the battery . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> then the case , do you want it flat or curved or sing or double curved ? <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> excellent . <EOS> calling . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> excellent . <EOS> and the the leaves plays the roles of of antennas ? <EOS> actually they do . <EOS> that's that's <EOS> yeah that's uh that's form and function in the one in the one uh object . <EOS>
it's difficult . <EOS> blue . <EOS> maybe green . <EOS> but don't we wanna make the background the the bright colo colours ? so th the total of the thing is very bright ? <EOS> like the pictures i showed you guys . <EOS> those things were all like like bright red , bright red , flashy . <EOS>
yeah , <EOS> 'cause what i thought , main <EOS> slogan . <EOS> uh then you know they're gonna be fairly brightly coloured anyway , <EOS> and we can have sort of a a a trimming as well , of the glow in the dark material , just as gimmickyness . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> well . <EOS> um are we gonna have the channel up and down as well as the number buttons ? <EOS> um 'cause yeah the market research said there is quite a lot of people do just zap around and flick , so . <EOS> okay , so we'll have um <EOS>
ah . <EOS> so , <EOS> as we discussed before , <EOS> we need to <EOS> we would like to have some speech recognition s chip in our remote control . <EOS> so <EOS> this can be simple kind of programmable chip <EOS> and <EOS> which can use microphone sensors . <EOS> and we also want to look at our remote control , <EOS> so . <EOS> still we are looking for possible uh technical uh specifications and how w easy we can do and within our pri range , like we're to in our twelve euros or around that . <EOS> so we are looking for simple devices or simple technology to do the location of remote control in a room or in a house . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> and left to right . <EOS> and those can also be used for the menu . <EOS> yeah exactly . <EOS> i thought but this is really your department , that we need just the functional display and four cursors . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> i would guess this like this pen would be kinda like a double-curved , <EOS> where it's curved on m m multiple axes , right ? <EOS> i think curved means just curved in one axis <EOS> and double-curved is curved in two axes <EOS> okay . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> mm . yeah , <EOS> the main that's the main stuff anyway , i mean <EOS> and you don't want to <EOS> i hate i hate looking at a control and seeing a million tiny little buttons with tiny little words saying what they all do <EOS> and just sitting there searching for the teletext button or something like that . <EOS>
mm-mm . <EOS> 'cause it it have to be universal , <EOS> so . <EOS> yeah . i agree with uh <EOS> the vocabulary is very small , <EOS> so that's not a problem . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> but there is one problem that uh baba talked about is the international <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah , okay . <EOS> ours had other features with <EOS> i think <EOS> yeah , <EOS> and then you have the audio settings , channel setting , video settings . <EOS> the easy volume up button . <EOS> those are features . <EOS> remote <EOS> younger people usually use the remote control to put on the volume . turn uh turn up the volume . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> and um but yeah that's <EOS> but <EOS> yeah . <EOS> if we're getting into universal remote territory , we're getting to l_c_d_ screens and things like that <EOS> which would drive the cost up a lot . <EOS> i don't know . i don't know whether that's necessary . <EOS> is the l_c_d_ screen <EOS>
but i mean in order to get to all of them , <EOS> you know . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> they would have to be within a certain amount of space with each other . <EOS> maybe . <EOS> but if you've only got like four or five buttons anyway , then it's it's not so much a problem , perhaps . <EOS>
sure . <EOS> no problem . <EOS> so any questions for uh time being ? <EOS> no . <EOS> so , the immediate next step is to start determining the functional design , or <EOS> okay . <EOS> yes . <EOS> okay . <EOS> to come up with the functional design and uh to discuss with ed , okay , and how it's going to be work , <EOS> and uh first of all with your user acceptance , okay , how it looks like and how it's going to be work in the market , okay , <EOS> so then we can discuss about uh further things . <EOS>
uh yes , we have plenty at home . <EOS> in fact , my daughter likes l remote controls . <EOS> to eat ? yeah , mainly , and to break . <EOS> mm yeah . <EOS> that <EOS> mm . to eat ? <EOS> so that could be a great um application . <EOS> remote controls children proof . <EOS> mm mm-hmm . <EOS>
okay . cool . <EOS> are particularly bothering you ? <EOS> mm um . no , i don't think so . <EOS> n <EOS> no . <EOS> no ? okay , cool . <EOS> then we shall start with a presentation from raj . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> hi , me raj , again . <EOS> uh in this meeting i i'm going to discuss about the trend watching , <EOS> uh how these trends is going to affect our market potential and how important is this . <EOS> so we have to look on this . <EOS> first of all methodology . <EOS> the met methodology to find out the trend was incl uh was done in a way <EOS> we have done a rec not only a recent remote control market survey , but we also considered the latest fre fashion trends of the market , <EOS> because we think that this is also a factor which will affect our sales and profit . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> and more about yourself , <EOS> you're from ? <EOS> 'kay . <EOS> um i'm from leicester , <EOS> um second year . <EOS> um what else do you want to know ? <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> i like sports um yeah , aerobics , kickboxing , spinning <EOS> um and uh <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> 'kay . you know i think <EOS> i mean if it w if we get a major television manufacturer to say y oh yeah we'll have that , save us the bother , then that's you know vast amounts of sales . quite quickly . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> so <EOS> i mean i think that we really have two main selling points , <EOS> i think that our casing and the voice recognition <EOS> yeah <EOS> 'cause with voice recognition <EOS> i mean really this is pretty bells and whistles kinda remote . <EOS> the voice rec thing , <EOS> i mean , if if we're looking at bottom line , now we're looking at upping the cost to seventeen to get the touch screen on , <EOS> i think we might have to drop the voice rec . <EOS>
bright citrus colours yeah . <EOS> mm . <EOS> well we we're supposed to stick to the company colours though , <EOS> that's yellow and grey . <EOS> so what have we , <EOS> lemon , banana , is <EOS> stick to the colours yeah . <EOS> oh yeah . <EOS> yellow and grey . <EOS>
oh like the twenty nine means like you have both scrolls and <EOS> push-button . <EOS> but we just have push <EOS> push-buttons . <EOS> but we don't have any scrolls . <EOS> okay . <EOS> right i think she's <EOS> i think what courtney's talking about is do we need to put two here ? <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> and uh uh of course there should be a case where we can keep all the things <EOS> and , you know different shapes or whatever it is there should be a case to put to give a shape . <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> i think it it's probably a little harder then most remotes to learn , <EOS> because you have to you have to use the menu system <EOS> and you have to tell it what your favourite channels are <EOS> and that could take a bit of learning at first , <EOS> but <EOS>
okay . <EOS> mm . <EOS> did you get my email ? <EOS> i did . <EOS> okay . <EOS> just making sure . <EOS> okay . <EOS> what i thought as well about the material is um maybe not this kind of material , but maybe more like um this kind of rubbery material , <EOS> it's a bit more bouncy , <EOS> like you said they get chucked around a lot . <EOS> um , a bit more durable and that can also be ergonomic <EOS> and it kind of feels a bit different from all the other remote controls . <EOS> the rubber rather than <EOS>
alright , okay . <EOS> okay , brilliant mm . <EOS> okay , nice and obvious there , <EOS> if it's standing up , i guess , yeah . <EOS> uh yeah , that <EOS> well , we did think of that . <EOS> yeah , if it's standing up it's it's on there , <EOS> but also we're gonna have the company name on the front , which is the little black kind of line in the middle . <EOS> so um and that's the um transmit the l_e_d_ thing . <EOS> these are the s two scroll ones which we thought could be channel up and down and volume up and down . <EOS> we n were weren't sure about putting them there , because um i it's it kind of could get bashed . <EOS>
right . <EOS> with um some kind of you know with with some kind of cutting edge battery technology <EOS> for twelve euros ? <EOS> yeah well hey you know well <EOS> it's it's worth looking into , <EOS> if not we can always default to just doing a a well presented plastic simple <EOS> you know so you know . well yeah i mean <EOS> you can put the we could i <EOS> i dunno <EOS> i mean i suppose we could put the the basics on the centre easiest <EOS> you know , you know <EOS> people know the channel and volume function <EOS> make them large and easy to get at <EOS> and then the the other the other bits and bobs you know go through menu um w we'll do the aesthetics . <EOS> okay so <EOS> we'll touch screen and the battery , <EOS> focus on um uh presentation . <EOS>
so <EOS> but then <EOS> i know what you mean . <EOS> same sides . <EOS> it's also easy to to have to to put in your hand . <EOS> but that's uh <EOS> yeah <EOS> but that's also how other remotes are shaped , <EOS> so that's uh <EOS> but perhaps that's a good thing , <EOS> so that's easy to use . <EOS> people know the <EOS>
okay . <EOS> so you think that uh a cable between the remote control and the t_v_ won't be a good idea . <EOS> no <EOS> it wou <EOS> maybe it will be cheaper i dunno <EOS> , i just may maybe you making a solu <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> uh , whatchamacallits , different um , you know , functions like volume <EOS> or , like you can tap just to get to different channels . <EOS> like if you just wanted to go to like from five to six you could tap or someth <EOS> right . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah <EOS> and <EOS> yeah and that was that was the number one sort of frustration that people said , so . <EOS> yep . <EOS> i don't think there's anything else on the market that does that , so . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i don't really know about the voice recognition thing . <EOS>
a banana . <EOS> um <EOS> it's , it <EOS> yeah . <EOS> the thing is you have t normally with um with buttons , they have to be at some point attached to a circuit board <EOS> so if you're gonna have things like on a cylindrical kind of device it may be difficult to kind of to build . <EOS>
irritating . <EOS> irritating . <EOS> irritating . <EOS> okay . <EOS> the means , the whiteboard didn't work . <EOS> and no internet . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i have to knock that one down a couple notches . <EOS> a and our friend here really feels strongly about the internet . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> do your exercises while you're watching the t_v_ . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> true , yeah , <EOS> m more more environmentally friendly . <EOS> yeah , that's what i was thinking as well . <EOS> mm-hmm . you know , <EOS> kind of the <EOS>
oh thank you . <EOS> whoo-hoo . <EOS> let's let's have party . <EOS> let's have some fun . <EOS> huh ? <EOS> images . <EOS> celebra <EOS> or shouldn't i ? <EOS> how big do you want the images ? <EOS> how big ? uh yeah . <EOS> not too big . whatever you think is good . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> well we decided against the solar cells so <EOS> oh yeah finally we say no . <EOS> okay so let's let's go let's go let go through all the lines . <EOS> so hand dynamo . <EOS> this something we didn't thought about . <EOS> solar cells , yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah , we said no to that . <EOS>
learnable ? <EOS> it's not not as fast as a usual uh uh remote control . <EOS> because because i think i think the scroll wheel , uh it's very handy , but the first time you get this thing in your hands , it's not to use the scroll wheel . <EOS> i think uh you must uh seek for it , and up or down or <EOS> uh then the re <EOS>
okay . <EOS> um so hopefully our remote control reflects that s in some way . <EOS> um so in conclusion , we need a our remote control needs to be something that's really fancy , um has lots of technolog tech technology in it . <EOS> um somehow would be good to have it related to fruit and vegetables with a spongy feel . <EOS> and that it's easy to use <EOS> and from our last meeting our you know fabian told us that w you know one of the requirements is that we have to reflect the look and feel of our of th the real reaction company . um . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> and that could allow n easy navigation , used as a joystick as well . <EOS> mm-hmm . the other key feature that uh that would be a good idea built into it is t is is to make something you know fairly sort of ergonomic , <EOS> something that just fits fits as comfortably as possible into the hand . <EOS> but of course , uh al al also allows for the possibility of a more sort of slightly unconventional or attractive uh sha shape for it overall , . <EOS>
uh , no that's okay , <EOS> sorry . <EOS> okay , um <EOS> i'll go over what we decided last meeting , <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> um , <EOS> we decided upon a universal control , one handset for all , t_v_ , video equipment . <EOS> um , that it was important that the product was accessible to a wide range of consumers , wide age range , not limiting anyone . <EOS> we decided it was important to reflect the company's image in our product , we put fashion in electronics , you know that kind of s thing . <EOS> um , our budget would have to affect um <EOS> try not to reflect our budget , um that we might
n oh wha what i've <EOS> what i've seen , just not related to this , but of latex cases before , is that there's uh like a hard plastic inside , and it's just covered with the latex . <EOS> not too thick a layer of latex , just enough to be grippable , like bike handles or or anything that you've seen like that . <EOS> the inside is hard . <EOS> i don't think we need to worry about protecting the circuit board , <EOS> i think that that's done for us . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> so it be uh a multi-purpose uh very technically uh high uh <EOS> from my point of view , yeah . <EOS> remote ? <EOS> yeah , <EOS> it must be really uh innovative , technical-wise ? <EOS> yeah , <EOS> it has to be <EOS> uh yeah , <EOS> our company is very uh good in making new innovative uh things . <EOS>
don't have a the the <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah <EOS> if we can send email from it . <EOS> but it's not the only the problem only the issue of controller , it's it's also the issue of the t_v_ . <EOS> no . no . <EOS> because the p the problem i can see with with the voice or the gesture itself wh what can happen in a family i i for example if <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> right . <EOS> well <EOS> then again colours wouldn't be so hard to do , <EOS> you could have uh a , you know , a um uh kind of a natural wood colour , like a stained wood and um , i don't know , olive green or something . <EOS> that wouldn't be so much of a problem to incorporate into the colour of the thing . <EOS>
if it's a bit like those juggling balls , you can change shape according to your to the way you hold it . <EOS> if it's got sand in it maybe , or something , you it it just moulds to your hand . <EOS> yeah you could squish it . <EOS>
ah well if no one else wants to , yeah . <EOS> mister . <EOS> okay so , want me to draw my favourite animal . <EOS> let's see . <EOS> well , i don't really have a favourite animal , but um <EOS> uh i think i have one in mind , so uh <EOS>
'kay . <EOS> . <EOS> um , findings , i've got my nice little picture there . <EOS> this is uh the chip called the t_a_ double one eight three five <EOS> which is what's used in pretty much every remote control 'cause it sends out standard signals , based on your input <EOS> and um it's pretty much used for all all t_v_ remotes at the moment . <EOS> um and then we we're loo looking into battery options . <EOS>
sort of liaise between the three of you <EOS> and get things going , get people talking <EOS> and and i'm gonna be making notes and sending them off to the powers that be and stuff basically . <EOS> um right , this for the purposes of this meeting <EOS> what this meeting is all about is um i'm gonna have some presentations from all three of you , <EOS> what you've been working on for the last wee while , <EOS> when you haven't been getting hit with spam on your computers and and , you know , filling out silly questionnaires and things . <EOS> but hopefully you've been actually been doing something productive . <EOS> so we're gonna <EOS> each of you gonna give us a litt a little presentation . um . <EOS>
why should you use a touchscreen on a remote control ? <EOS> there are buttons on it . <EOS> uh maybe be uh it's it's <EOS> no <EOS> you can make an uh manual in it . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> or um maybe to keep it uh easy and uh small . <EOS>
hmm . <EOS> yeah , 'cause we need to we definitely need to have buttons for like sub-titles and things like that . <EOS> it's 'cause the foreign film market is expanding and stuff , <EOS> and like on television like i know f k living in los angeles it's tons of spanish network television <EOS> if it has english sub-titles it's definitely helpful . <EOS>
on the left . <EOS> s so , yeah . <EOS> uh sorry . <EOS> you can also include clip-art . <EOS> okay . <EOS> current colour ? <EOS> so um <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so if you'll rather draw in paint or something <EOS> okay . uh <EOS> shall we make some outline sketches of the basic shape first ? <EOS> because i i <EOS>
because that might <EOS> yeah . okay , well if you read the manual , <EOS> always . <EOS> perhaps that is one of the most uh <EOS> yeah , alright . <EOS> m maybe that's the most user friendly and easy to use . because it it's not it's not it's it's not uh difficult . <EOS> you say you say uh record to to the to the speech recognition , <EOS> then you say the question and the answer . <EOS> and that's everything it does , the speech recognition . <EOS>
nah . <EOS> square one in a way . <EOS> um if we were gonna try to undo one bit we'd probably have to undo most of it , um <EOS> yeah . <EOS> although we don't wanna get rid of the whole environmental <EOS> i mean obviously the solar cell is a big piece of the way we're marketing this as like a natural , new thing , <EOS> but honestly if we cut that one piece out we're actually coming in under budget <EOS> if i've done my math correctly . <EOS>
so the working design , i've got a very quick presentation on this , <EOS> so um i've <EOS> oh no , <EOS> you can't see a thing . <EOS> oh well , <EOS> i'm gonna draw it on the board then . <EOS> it's in blue uh , and i couldn't change it . <EOS> we it's fine on my screen , <EOS> but never mind . <EOS> so um the idea is that we've got the <EOS>
no , <EOS> okay well , <EOS> that's true . <EOS> no , okay , <EOS> so so it's fancy . <EOS> that's fancy enough . <EOS> that not . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> then ? <EOS> okay , one two . <EOS> that doesn't matter that much , <EOS> so make it a one . <EOS>
absolutely , <EOS> f for somebody who very often , if he would <EOS> a person who switches channels very often or does use a particular function very often will find it very irritating to use a <EOS> and he might spoil the touch-pad very fast compared to a button like , if you keep punching with an pointer or whatever . <EOS>
um . <EOS> ..it's very , it's very hard thing to predict <EOS> because you have different cases <EOS> and that might open up your market a little bit obviously , <EOS> but if you have just one case and it doesn't go very well mm . <EOS> it's a tough situation , <EOS> but obviously having more cases also costs more <EOS> so <EOS>
yeah , okay . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> they use teletext and not the internet on a remote control . <EOS> that's ridiculous . <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah , okay . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> that's a ne i it <EOS> it's a new technology , <EOS> but it's not incorporated right now . <EOS>
. <EOS> okay . <EOS> yep . <EOS> okay . <EOS> so we're down to sixteen point four , yeah . <EOS> and we and we have a single-curved uh <EOS> is that a single-curved rather than a double-curved ? <EOS> uh i think that <EOS> we've got a we've got a curve and a droop . <EOS> i don't know whether that . <EOS>
yes . <EOS> yeah , well that's that's the question . <EOS> hmm hmm . <EOS> uh no . mm , i i i don't think no . it's not . <EOS> well maybe there's <EOS> there's an idea you know t the new for example new portable phones ? <EOS> they have like removable plastic cases , so you can have a striped one or you can have a fluorescent blue one , or whatever , <EOS> and maybe something like that , <EOS> that in each package you know you have you you have you have for example uh you have let's say a fluorescent blue on it but then you have uh another colour or stripe whatever that already comes in a package . <EOS> and then if people really want more colours they can buy it separately . <EOS>
well <EOS> i may be wrong here , <EOS> but i'd been thinking of this device as being a a cheap mass-produced device . <EOS> we're trying to sell four million of 'em , <EOS> um that's that's , you know , that's almost one in every tenth household or whatever it is . <EOS> um and i hadn't thought of it as being a reparable thing , <EOS> you just <EOS> if it goes wrong you chuck it out , <EOS> and that's why i'm a bit concerned . <EOS> i like the idea of speech recognition , that's a great idea , <EOS> but i'm not convinced we can put it into this box for the price that we need gonna need to hit . <EOS>
it's a memory , yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah this is cool . <EOS> maybe we can include that also . previous previous channel button . <EOS> so we have like channel button , the previous channel button , the volume button , plus a mute button , and uh just the the traditional on off button . <EOS>
different languages ? <EOS> that should still be viable . <EOS> we've got an advanced chip , <EOS> we've got the use of the l_c_d_ . <EOS> so being able to communicate in multiple languages is still very much a possibility . <EOS> um but what's something we need to decide on is how we're gonna go from here . <EOS> we do need to try and come up with an idea <EOS> which could be continued with other people if need be . um . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> i'll write down our scores up on the <EOS> ooh . <EOS> okay so number one . <EOS> do we have a fancy look-and-feel ? <EOS> mm . <EOS> feel i think . <EOS> we've been quite successful with the rubber coating <EOS> and <EOS> yeah . <EOS> the look is a little bit more playful . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> six , let's go for six . <EOS> without l_c_d_ . <EOS> both . <EOS> no <EOS> actually uh to make it with l_c_d_ you make more efforts . <EOS> so i there is high innovativeness included if you make it with l_c_d_ y <EOS> then when it is without l_c_d_ there is not much innovativeness . <EOS> so we can't go <EOS>
oh . <EOS> ah . <EOS> is a battery like the only way of <EOS> well , it's just , you don't want it plugged in really , s <EOS> yeah , alternate energy source , like win wind power or <EOS> yeah , you blow on it and i <EOS>
let's pass . <EOS> uh-huh . <EOS> sorry , <EOS> what's the yellow one in the middle , <EOS> i forgot . <EOS> uh the menu select button . <EOS> very interesting . <EOS> i think that one's my favourite . <EOS> so that's <EOS> so that's our three prototypes . <EOS> um basically , <EOS> in terms of making decisions , what we'd need to do is first of all decide on a form uh which of the three different shapes we want , <EOS> then decide what kind of button layout we want , how many buttons , <EOS> and then to choose what colours we want to make the buttons <EOS> and if we wanna put any text on the device , like label on the buttons or put a brand name or or a logo on it or whatever . <EOS>
yep . <EOS> yep . <EOS> i wonder what button i press ? <EOS> just do it on the arrow . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> or how about i just click ? <EOS> okay , here is our agenda for this meeting . <EOS> um we're gonna start with our opening which was our introductions . <EOS> we're gonna get to know each other a little bit better . <EOS> um tool training , we're going to , i guess , figure out what to do on this project with our individual roles . <EOS> um we're gonna make a project plan and then have some time for discussion and close up the meeting . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> i <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> vol volume selection okay , yep , <EOS> the teletext we're gambling with , <EOS> and we're gonna say it's dead , the way of the dodo <EOS> no , <EOS> yeah , <EOS> okay okay . <EOS> yeah , um <EOS> so we <EOS> well , <EOS> sorry , <EOS> we could maybe even go as far as saying power button , small joystick , l_c_d_ , <EOS> and then what <EOS> maybe is it one more button to say that you're using the menu system , <EOS> and with the possibility of pushing down on the joystick to say okay ? <EOS> so we're having very very few buttons involved , <EOS> but navigation around a menu for most things . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> think minimum two weeks if we're gonna develop prototypes and then try to take them to different places and see how people use <EOS> it's not a trivial task . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , because we we are not going to do it in uh our factory , okay , so we can give it a product evalua <EOS> yes , yes . <EOS>
it is true <EOS> that you always sit around you know , you're sitting on your sofa and you wanna change something , there's five different remotes , and one for the d_v_d_ and one for the video and one for cable and one for whatever else . <EOS> but i presume this is t i presume this is just for television . <EOS>
yeah fair enough . <EOS> i've already got more than i can keep track of . <EOS> and i'm gonna go home next week <EOS> and everyone's gonna be like oh my god you're turning into one of those people , <EOS> no . <EOS> oh , <EOS> have you been home yet ? <EOS> they'll be like , say something british , <EOS> and you're like oh shut up family . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> i dunno . <EOS> if i one button is still one more button . <EOS> if if <EOS> if we want to make it very simple we have to reduce number of buttons compared to th to our competitors . <EOS> so . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> well anyway i have this point . <EOS> we can discuss . <EOS> also um so <EOS> as as i told before uh it would be better if it's only for the t_v_ um <EOS> because we want to be quick on on the market . <EOS> and then also we have to make very uh uh clear that this uh this remote control is is part of of our products and show our corporate uh logo and and colours on the on the design as well so that uh they identify it as one of our product . <EOS> so this is the the key point . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> she gonna answer me or not ? <EOS> yeah , i've got <EOS> right , both of them , okay . <EOS> yes . <EOS> god . <EOS> jesus , it's gonna fall off . <EOS> okay . yep , yep . <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> hello everybody . <EOS> um i'm sarah , <EOS> the project manager <EOS> and this is our first meeting , surprisingly enough . <EOS> okay , this is our agenda , um <EOS>
well the twenty five to thirty five year old , and thirty five , and the thirty five to forty five , forty five point seven per cent say no , so <EOS> people people from the age of thirty f there's a big drop off there . <EOS> for people up to the age of thirty five , you're kinda saying , yeah , they want it . <EOS>
that can control o other things . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm . <EOS> ah . <EOS> of course yeah <EOS> we should take that into account <EOS> in the uh <EOS> yeah yes <EOS> i i i <EOS> that's handy . <EOS> so if the b t_v_ in the next apartment's really loud , you can just turn it off . <EOS>
hmm . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> and we don't have multiple things that it has to control , it just has to control the t_v_ . <EOS> it's not gonna be a huge universal remote . <EOS> w <EOS> we need to decide , well so we can figure how big it's gonna be , like exactly what buttons we want <EOS> and exactly <EOS>
but it's not going to have more functionality , <EOS> 'cause it's only a low market , it's a cheap-end remote control , <EOS> we can't beat modern functionality , <EOS> we might we'll be able to beat them on th the look of it , th the design of it <EOS> but that's not a big seller , <EOS> if <EOS> they're not just going to buy a new remote control just 'cause it looks pretty , <EOS> they have to actually need it as well . <EOS> so i'm not sure how we can get people to buy this thing . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> so uh you'll be leading the team for your design team or how many members is working in the team , for the design ? <EOS> uh for the industrial design ? <EOS> yes . <EOS> um well , i would th think that depends on how much money you give us . <EOS>
um , would you like to continue on from that ? <EOS> yep . <EOS> ooh . <EOS> 'kay . <EOS> it can be <EOS> okay , that's okay with me . <EOS> or , maybe move the laptop over . <EOS> further . <EOS> oops . <EOS> why's it not working ? <EOS> f_ eight , right ? <EOS>
hmm . <EOS> oh . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah , who knows . <EOS> okay . <EOS> so you're talking about like when it leaves our salesroom then it's all gonna be cherry-coloured <EOS> or is it gonna be the kinda thing where people come back and swap it ? <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> ah-ha . <EOS> you can also take into account the fact that the banana fits with the colour scheme of our company . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> oh , yeah <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah it's really uh really a good point . <EOS> i hope the students of management die , <EOS> but anyway . <EOS>
hmm . <EOS> right . <EOS> right . <EOS> nice . <EOS> um , one thing that i noticed was that most remotes operate on a infrare on the infrared part of the spectrum . <EOS> so you notice when you push a button on a remote you can't see anything coming out of it <EOS> but in fact there is light coming out of the remote <EOS> and you know the television can detect that . <EOS> and if you were to record <EOS> if you were to make a video recording you could actually see the light . <EOS> uh one thing that i thought might be interesting <EOS> was to use part use visible light coming out of the remote , just kind of as a fun gimmick . <EOS> so you could actually see something coming out of the remote when you pushed it . <EOS> course it'd have to be a part of the spectrum that wouldn't damage the human eye or anything like that . <EOS>
yeah . that is true . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> it's just uh u using uh your thumb . <EOS> so um <EOS> it's <EOS> y yeah . yeah . <EOS> i think we could just uh leave it a normal shape . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> uh but maybe we have to make it a l a bit more fancy . in one or ano another way . <EOS>
what kind of things do we have to consider there ? <EOS> can we <EOS> what kind of size , <EOS> does it come in varying sizes or is it just one size and we would have to fit the design of <EOS> well <EOS> well this the thi <EOS> the thing about is um they they can be as big or as small as you want them to be <EOS> because you can you can print circuit board like that <EOS> that it's it's simply spaced like that so you can have fit the n the size of the nine buttons in . <EOS> if you if you see how thin the tracks are , you could you could s you could put them virtually right next to each other and have a much smaller switch on each one , <EOS> if you if you wanted to <EOS> but um the <EOS> there is an option to do to do it like that , <EOS> or you could have some sort of <EOS>
okay . <EOS> yeah . okay . <EOS> so <EOS> is our target group then people <EOS> so do we wanna go ahead and design this thing with the finder button ? <EOS> so <EOS> i think that seems to yeah . mm . <EOS> it's easy to implement . <EOS>
this one ? <EOS> turn . <EOS> can you pass the mouse , <EOS> please . <EOS> oh okay , that's fine . <EOS> okay . um so basically i just want to presented to you present to you some recent results we've had from um looking at uh um some remote control market research and some fashion trends around the world . um <EOS>
yeah , <EOS> it's uh it's good , to to create a control instead of a computer . <EOS> yeah , i think i find it really funny and amazing and interesting to go through all the process to from the beginning to the end . <EOS> and designing , looking at the chips , the solar cells and uh and it was very informative for . <EOS>
i think the batteries would have to go right under the plastic case . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> th and that would that <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> especially if you're switching out the squishy part . <EOS> then you need to have the other part just be sort of a single unit that you can snap off . <EOS>
whereas um the the trend was as users as users um became older and older uh they were less likely to want these sort of features in a um in a remote control . <EOS> so i guess it depends on where we're focusing our our market . <EOS> um and as our company motto is putting fashion in electronics , um i think we're focusing on the younger younger um target demographic , <EOS> and so maybe we should think about adding these sort of high technology features into our remote control . <EOS>
it is now , <EOS> you're in charge <EOS> so <EOS> there you go . <EOS> but i trust that she would jump in if i was <EOS> so okay <EOS> fair enough . <EOS> um right , um so <EOS> any thoughts ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> whatever . <EOS>
well , obviously . <EOS> yes . yes . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm that'd have to be thrown out on the market for people to get an idea , <EOS> to see get get their <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so you can take a minimum two weeks to a maximum four weeks . <EOS>
oh . oh <EOS> can i ask something ? <EOS> what is special colour ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> is that the wood uh wood uh <EOS> this , we have to have that one too ? <EOS> i think it is . <EOS> it isn't . <EOS> what ? <EOS>
stick it on the t_v_ . <EOS> pray that you don't accidentally lose that piece . <EOS> right . <EOS> that'd be tough then . <EOS> well also your remote would uh alarm you if somebody stole you t your television , yeah . <EOS> ran off with it without taking the beautiful remote control . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah <EOS> because <EOS> yeah . <EOS> wha but what would be <EOS> one question , <EOS> what would be the goal of putting an l_c_d_ in a remote control ? <EOS> well th <EOS> what what kind of information ? <EOS> 'cause you can have things like the programme name instead of the channel numbers , like an interactive programme guide . <EOS>
that can be the t <EOS> that can be like the turbo banana plus plus commando . <EOS> plus plus , okay . <EOS> maybe objective banana ? <EOS> okay . <EOS> thanks very much . <EOS> we'll see n next meeting . <EOS> bye . <EOS> so meeting's over ? <EOS>
okay , <EOS> just make a separate remote for each uh <EOS> well , <EOS> you sh you should to adjust the thing . <EOS> i think it's difficult . <EOS> every language of dialects <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i think it's very differen difficult . <EOS> and you have to speak the <EOS> so that it can understand . <EOS>
hmm , that's interesting . <EOS> well <EOS> i don't know if you've noticed , but uh we're working for real reaction . <EOS> uh it's a company in uh electronics . <EOS> we put fashion in electronics , <EOS> uh we make it work , <EOS> uh we put a lot of effort in design and in the product itself . <EOS> i'm bart the project manager <EOS> so i'll direct you through the project . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> that's new one ? <EOS> we didn't make any uh <EOS> yeah . <EOS> uh , <EOS> we should save that one . <EOS> oh <EOS> in <EOS> then i'll move this one . <EOS> didn't we just do that ? <EOS> yeah , <EOS> save in the folder . save as project . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> especially if you do them on too tight and you can't get the leverage on them to undo them . <EOS> i know . <EOS> 'kay , <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> um this is uh all about the design of the actual components <EOS> and the availability of the components we have in stock at the moment . <EOS> okay , first uh the into the method . <EOS> the the main idea of the whole thing is just so you sh you just press buttons and it should activate things on the t_v_ <EOS> and we discussed last meeting that it should be easy to find . <EOS> um also in this study i've looked into the availability of some of the materials , <EOS> 'cause some of the things that we looked at last time aren't un unfortunately aren't available . <EOS>
i don't <EOS> i think all these things are pretty standard . <EOS> i think we'll be okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> onto participant four . <EOS> well you know for marketing f marketing for me is uh <EOS> and uh how do i go here ? <EOS> okay . <EOS>
yeah , <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> right . <EOS> um but <EOS> and i i felt the first two meetings , that i was coming in with no information , <EOS> and not sort of <EOS> mm . <EOS> made me really like , ooh i don't know , throwing together powerpoint out of no no information <EOS> and then last time it was like the opposite . <EOS> i had so much information and so much to talk about . <EOS>
that's a good point . <EOS> you can incorporate names into the menu . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> okay . <EOS> even news , music . like they do on uh sky digital kinda . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so you <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so <EOS> what it looks like to me is we'll use a large number of standard components , um , <EOS> say something like um lithium ion battery , <EOS> the kind that you find in most um small hand held devices now . um <EOS> looks like we going for a double curved design . <EOS> um i don't know what cost implications there are in that . <EOS> um , looks like we're pretty much decided on some kind of flexible rubber . <EOS> though i'd have to say depending on how flexible it is , we might need to have some kind of inner frame . <EOS>
yeah . the surf uh design . <EOS> mm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> what what features are we actually including ? <EOS> are we including like a location kind of thing like trying to find it ? <EOS> uh no <EOS> i think it's more of the feel . <EOS>
yeah , <EOS> but you can lose it . <EOS> no no <EOS> it's n y if you lose it <EOS> so well <EOS> for example if it is somewhere in the room if i maybe if it is in the table there you can always say s channel one and the t the remote control gives the order to the t_v_ to switch to channel one . <EOS>
huh , oh right . <EOS> no . <EOS> a chat would also be uh <EOS> but the technology was uh fantastic . <EOS> yeah , the technology's okay . <EOS> well , <EOS> i i don't really like the board , <EOS> it doesn't really work great . sometimes i think . <EOS>
is that alright now ? <EOS> okay . <EOS> sorry ? <EOS> okay , everybody all set to start the meeting ? <EOS> okay , we've got half an hour for this one um to uh discuss the um functional design . <EOS> all ready to go ? <EOS> okay . <EOS> um so hopefully you've all been working away , <EOS> and i've put the minutes of the last meeting in the project folder . <EOS> um so i guess just to to recap on uh what we did last time . <EOS> um kind of uh got to know each other a little bit and uh got familiar with all the equipment <EOS> and started to discuss um a bit about the project , you know , cost-wise how much how much money we had to s <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> but it's cool to have it all on one , <EOS> because you wanna turn it on then you wanna turn up the volume , and then you wanna go to the menu , so you don't wanna switch . <EOS> yeah , yeah , yeah . <EOS>
yeah , i'll go with five . <EOS> five . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm . personally , i think given that the product um only replaces a single remote control <EOS> that you've already got , <EOS> are people really gonna shell out twenty five euros for something that's only marginally good ? <EOS>
all of us ? <EOS> i don't know . hmm . <EOS> well there's al eight , nine . <EOS> ooh . <EOS> oh ooh . <EOS> hmm . or is that just me ? <EOS>
uh , so i think we have a lot <EOS> we have to take decision today , <EOS> so i think we have to do some work to finalise our idea and take decisions . <EOS> uh first i think energy it's a key problem <EOS> because uh it depend what can we have as feature if we use only batteries , for example , or something like that . <EOS> because can we have l_c_d_ and speech recognition with battery , <EOS> and it's also r related to the size of the of the devi of the device ? <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> now we would like to have a presentation by the marketing expert on production evaluation . <EOS> okay , i'll take my file down so you can bring it up . <EOS> 'kay should be able to get it now . <EOS> 'kay , why don't you move just to the next slide right away . <EOS>
fifty percent , you're kidding . <EOS> p <EOS> not too shabby . <EOS> so i have here an <EOS> yeah . <EOS> we want a fifty percent profit on this . <EOS> oh you can't really see that very well . <EOS> charge about three hundred quid for it . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> and besides that it's um <EOS> if we're gonna focus on elderly people they'll have to adapt . <EOS> they're not used to using scroll buttons . <EOS> so perhaps we should s stick to the basic layout . <EOS> mm . <EOS> that's right . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> yes , that uh <EOS> so i'll come back to the <EOS> so evaluation criteria , i think uh that will be good , <EOS> so then let's come to the finance uh , <EOS> i have some uh calculations which i made uh as for uh the budget . <EOS> so here you can uh look like uh the energy and uh dynamo and uh kinetic and solar cells . <EOS> uh it's optional , somewhat optional <EOS> and ed wants the chip on print , that's what uh we were talking about that . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah <EOS> we we can certainly push for a more expensive product if that's gonna be <EOS> well , see i i see i i'm an advocate to make this an exclusive product . <EOS> you know , let's let's sell this wholesale for for fifty euros , sixty euros . <EOS> let's make this thing really exclusive , environmentally sensitive , uh high-tech design , uh ergonomics , all of this . <EOS> just make this thing uh , yeah , the the the rolls royce of of remote controls . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> and also like a clapping uh li like device that uh pops open . <EOS> opens up <EOS> is too difficult <EOS> or uh <EOS> flips open . <EOS> uh too difficult , <EOS> um maybe uh it's easier to break it . <EOS> n yeah . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> changing the signal . <EOS> what he's doing when he's configuring this pattern , this chip , uh is trying to switch off the television . <EOS> and when it's uh switched off , you can push a button as uh it's working now , <EOS> so <EOS> and then he saves that setting <EOS> and then um it's working . <EOS>
i'm not sure have you ever come across a universal remote control yourself , <EOS> but you have to i <EOS> they're a nightmare to use . <EOS> you have to set them , reset them to everything . <EOS> um and that would only add buttons . <EOS> whereas i think the aim is to take away buttons . <EOS> so i think it'd be better maybe to concentrate on maybe just a universal one for t_v_s . <EOS> um or maybe just one that you could we could design <EOS> and then different people , manufacturers could use it to set to their specifications , if if the aim is to get something that's unique in design . um <EOS>
okay . <EOS> um however , this is where we kinda have to be very , i think , creative about it . <EOS> number two was that it be innovative . <EOS> okay so that tells me that we have to find a way to be innovative without a adding just unnecessary um sort of functional bits to it . <EOS> uh and third priority uh for ease of use , <EOS> so again that kind of gives us a general picture of how it has to be , um quite user friendly while still having technology . <EOS> so it i'll just say right away as a bit of a foreshadowing into how we proceed with this in terms of m marketing , <EOS> is that i think um what we should think about is how the um about how the innovation uh contributes to the look and feel , and not so much to the functionality of it . <EOS> for example like when you pick it up and push it like it all lights up or something , you know what i mean , <EOS> like , or it's got something else to it that just seems innovative <EOS> because obviously the thing that <EOS> the message here is ease of use . <EOS> so how do you make innovation make something more more easy to use ? <EOS> well that's i guess where we're gonna go with this . <EOS> okay then there's the other aspect of the back the the market um <EOS>
yeah . yeah so . <EOS> you'd been going a long time dividing that . <EOS> it's two point four two eight five se it just keeps going on . <EOS> oh my god . <EOS> okay . <EOS> two point four two basically . <EOS> yeah we'll go with that . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> when we did uh f fashions uh , recent fashion uh our recent fashion update shows that <EOS> sorry . <EOS> i was just reading fruit and vegetables . <EOS> hard to know how we are going to incorporate that . <EOS> ah yeah ? <EOS> y yeah uh yeah , <EOS> we have to , <EOS> because uh d you can see how people have related their clothes , shoes , and everything with fruits and vegetables , <EOS> because the g world is now changing it's trend towards organic , <EOS> becoming more and more organic , <EOS> becoming <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so something like that we we should do . <EOS>
if we can afford yeah . so actually we're going to create a a button-less uh remote . no buttons at all . <EOS> okay , well <EOS> that's might be a unique selling point , huh for a remote . <EOS> okay , well <EOS> i guess we have to <EOS>
i don't th <EOS> it will be rolling a lot . <EOS> yeah but i li i like your idea that we shouldn't have a lot of buttons b buttons so <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah <EOS> and you you you will not have pla enough a lot of place to put a l_c_d_ on a banana also . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> well <EOS> just do it quickly <EOS> if if we al already . <EOS> so <EOS> it's just a shortlist of criteria on um the things that we've identified as being important to selling the product . <EOS> um we just go through these <EOS> and rate them as a group <EOS> and then at the end we'll make an evaluation based on that , <EOS> so just average the score of those items , <EOS> so <EOS>
yes . <EOS> no it's your choice . <EOS> wow , that's pretty quick . <EOS> tu-dum . <EOS> uh uh um <EOS> just pick one . <EOS> you have to decide . <EOS> it's the lower one . <EOS> what's this ? a bomb or not a bo <EOS> this the bomb ? <EOS>
uh no . <EOS> it's a mouse . <EOS> a mouse-y ? <EOS> that's not a mouse-y , no . <EOS> no it's not a mouse . <EOS> it's a wombat . <EOS> oh . <EOS> it's a ratty . <EOS> argh . <EOS> rat . <EOS> a what ? <EOS>
okay . <EOS> the only problem with that is if you forget to take it out of your pocket and it goes in wash . <EOS> oh . <EOS> you're kidding . <EOS> you know it happens . <EOS> i've had three watches go that way too . <EOS> hmm . <EOS>
yes . <EOS> i think we can put on the here . yes . yes . <EOS> uh basically w yeah we we designed the two uh items . <EOS> mm . um yes <EOS> but w we <EOS> um , can we have a phone , <EOS> can someone <EOS>
uh <EOS> from our manufacturing department . <EOS> so this would be an example of bad layout , <EOS> where you have volume up and volume down , but they have a v_ on both of them , so uh <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> it's sort of confusing for the user . <EOS> uh this is the example of the giant remote that's impossible to lose . <EOS> and for something for kids . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> hm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> seems kind of like an excessive reiteration . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> it seems like way overkill . <EOS> like if i missed a meeting i could probably get it summed up in like one sentence . <EOS> i wouldn't need to have to watch like a t two hour video with the sound and the transcript and <EOS>
oh . <EOS> yeah , okay , that's true , that's true . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so <EOS> which <EOS> but that's that's vantage of l_c_d_ screen , <EOS> you can have text . <EOS> so <EOS> which number are we going to fill in ? <EOS> i would say yeah . <EOS>
i would propose this concept for design , just few buttons , a screen with a back light which can change colours , titanium <EOS> mm . <EOS> i think , <EOS> and uh what else ? <EOS> i got just very few and good ideas . <EOS> we need power and volume . <EOS> and let us include two nice features into this device , <EOS> first , power on and off can be made fully automatic . <EOS> when you go to the sofa , take your control <EOS> and point it to the t_v_ , <EOS>
well my p is <EOS> nathan ? <EOS> mm . <EOS> um , this is just off the top of my head keep in mind , <EOS> but i think the voice recognition would <EOS> they're both mm they're both gonna push the costs up , <EOS> but um , since we already have the technology in-house for the voice recognition <EOS> we're not gonna have to do as much design work <EOS> and sometimes the design work is what push the costs up , if you know what i mean . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> ah . <EOS> but the b the b whiteboard could've actually been this kind of continuing um <EOS> so do you think producing a prototype earlier in the process woulda been a good idea ? <EOS> think could be , yeah . <EOS> i think um the the focus of it a lot was the powerpoint as opposed to the to the whiteboard , <EOS> and i think that m um is also does you know hinder us and things i think . <EOS> it will be cooler to have the whiteboard rather than the the powerpoint , <EOS> or maybe the whiteboard and the powerpoint in the same place , <EOS> you know in the centre of the <EOS>
right . that's just me . yeah , i don't i don't know how for twenty fi , or twelve euros fifty how much of a excellent screen you could get , <EOS> you'd you'd have to sort of keep it down to a black and white l_c_d_ thing anyway , i'd assume . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> no . <EOS> b_b_c_ one . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> oh . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , that's true . <EOS> just to activate it . <EOS> or or something just to identify that you've lifted it up and it's use . <EOS> and and then just say , oh i don't know , a thought and and then <EOS> uh i mean that that would certainly be uh truly different . <EOS>
display in . but as far as production um i'm putting up a question <EOS> because we're talking about profit also , <EOS> and in mine you'll see uh the l_c_d_ in , yeah . the problem with uh our survey , the p the possibility that how many units can be sold , what percentage of the market , etcetera etcetera because that has to be taken in into consideration . <EOS>
yeah , <EOS> so we should also implement se screen settings . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> screen settings , audio settings , teletext settings you have . <EOS> oh right . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> channel settings . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> so you can program the <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i think i think the fact that , you know , ninety one point two percent of fifteen to twenty five year olds are saying yes , i would pay more for a voice recognition remote control , does say quite a lot really . <EOS> you know , so i mean that and the disposable income and i don't think it's something to ignore , you know . <EOS>
oh okay , yeah . <EOS> it seems like that would be hard though . <EOS> i mean , like because unless you know <EOS> yeah . <EOS> just 'cause i wouldn't <EOS> i would probably pick it up and just be like uh why is there no on button . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> b yeah . <EOS>
no . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . well <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . oh um mo <EOS> no , <EOS> you can just say uh the c <EOS> no no no . <EOS> he he he he me he means just just one other thing . <EOS> uh , with the current remote controls , the universal ones , um you have to press yeah , you have to press a code for t_v_ . <EOS>
right , <EOS> i haven't gotten any <EOS> yeah , <EOS> any more information on cost other than it's more expensive than a regular battery , <EOS> but um but if we're using a an i a cheaper chip , then it'll even out , i think . <EOS> costs . <EOS> but over time <EOS>
okay . <EOS> so <EOS> just think of um the usability . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> just think of the problem . <EOS> if when you have wireless remote control and if you lose it ? <EOS> design a wireless remote control . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i think it's would be easier to have a link between the remote control and the television , <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> despite working in interface design , i'm not the greatest artist in the world , so you'll have to forgive me . <EOS> you'd have something like this with an on-off switch fairly big , <EOS> sort of in the corner and by itself , so you don't accidentally turn your t_v_ off while you're trying to manoeuvre other buttons . <EOS> and then you have sort of one of those toggle displays for , oops , channels and volume , sort of for surfing channels and then volume , <EOS> so the volume would be the up and down , 'cause volume goes up and down and then channels left to right . <EOS> and then here you'd have your sort of standard , telephonish number pad . <EOS> and then on one side you would have an access to the menu on your t_v_ <EOS> and on the other side a way to turn off the voice control . <EOS> so that if the user doesn't want to use their voice , they can just turn it off and you don't have the remote control accidentally changing things on you . <EOS>
oh is it locked 'cause i'm in it ? <EOS> i dunno . <EOS> i think it just means that we can't add any more to it now . <EOS> have you have you completed it ? <EOS> or <EOS> okay . <EOS> no . <EOS> no , i was hoping that you guys could . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> keeping it nice and slick , would be important . <EOS> and <EOS> i don't know , <EOS> like , <EOS> there's such a problem with losing them , <EOS> that adding this whole like p_d_a_ pen business is only one more thing to lose , <EOS> so we're gonna have to be careful with what like <EOS>
mm . <EOS> or if it is false , it doesn't it looks uh it doesn't look much fancy , then you could just tell me seven . <EOS> so <EOS> so <EOS> so is the e evaluation depending on us or other users ? <EOS> we can make our study on this and <EOS> no no <EOS> we have you have designed two products now , <EOS> one is with l_c_d_ and without l_c_d_ . <EOS>
sure . sure . <EOS> yeah , w i'm done . <EOS> more or less . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> ps oh , it's just putting the rest of it into words , <EOS> but it's essentially the same thing . <EOS> um you have a transmitter , an input device , logic chip , <EOS> you know , stuff like that . <EOS> um <EOS>
but it would be coordinating with that of course . <EOS> yeah that c hey that that could you know match the handset . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> you could have a broccoli , or you could have a mango . <EOS> um if you wanna look in your project documents folder , there's an excel spreadsheet . <EOS> um the only one that's in there , production costs . <EOS> and if you open it up . <EOS> um i've just stuck the numbers in , <EOS> it was a real challenge there . <EOS> but if i missed anything that we've gone over , or if you see something that has changed <EOS> i mean , we decided on batteries , <EOS> and the regular chip would be necessary for the more advanced ipod-like button . <EOS> um <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> no not everyone can whistle , can they , though ? <EOS> no , <EOS> clapping , i think clapping , <EOS> yeah . yeah . <EOS> i'd go more <EOS> yeah , <EOS> f more for clap . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> 'kay we've already decided that we don't need a teletext button , haven't we ? <EOS>
i think the look is better <EOS> but the feel is is is worse . <EOS> so so i would also say this is four . <EOS> but w w do you what do you think ? <EOS> okay . <EOS> uh it's fine i think . <EOS> my just that um the feel is that um you <EOS> right now you you don't see the feel <EOS> because right uh for example if you press it quite inside now like this , now it's embedded one . <EOS>
yeah , of course . <EOS> yeah , we can c_c_ him on any discussions or documents that are passed around . <EOS> yes . <EOS> okay and please please copy all the mails , okay , all the discussions to me , okay , <EOS> so i need to submit to the management . <EOS>
you can always add a few <EOS> yeah . <EOS> hmm , <EOS> the c_d_ player . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . yeah so <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah i i know what you mean , <EOS> but you'll ne need several other buttons for a video player . <EOS> you need a play and a forw fast forward and a stop function . <EOS> and you you don't need that for a t_v_ . <EOS> and and for a t uh teletext you need additional buttons as well , <EOS> so i kind of need to know what we uh need . <EOS>
there we go . <EOS> so i think we've done very well , <EOS> but <EOS> i think that's a . <EOS> cool . <EOS> so , we need the average here , <EOS> so we got <EOS> very good . <EOS> what's the assessment ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> the average is about six and something . <EOS> a little bit over six . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> two , <EOS> so it's <EOS> okay . <EOS> but if we make a right-handed and a left-handed then ? <EOS> mm . <EOS> if we're gonna have one left-handed and one right-handed then i would give it a one , but otherwise otherwise a two . <EOS>
so <EOS> we don't have it flip open . <EOS> we just have a ball <EOS> but then maybe to go back to the to th s something along those things then . <EOS> to the other design . <EOS> okay , <EOS> so then we forget the ball . <EOS> it looks cool , <EOS> but it's really not it's not functional um . <EOS> so we've got our sort of keyboard kind . <EOS> what if we flipped it around here , <EOS> so that it were um <EOS>
mm-hmm <EOS> to do remote control <EOS> mm . <EOS> which will be used for for the television , for the recorder , for the camcorder and all the others , it will become too complex <EOS> and it will increase the pli the price <EOS> and we can't do that . <EOS> we really want to focus on the remote control for the television . <EOS> is it okay ? <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> this would be uh <EOS> why did we wanna put the display in the bottom ? <EOS> no that's not s sure so <EOS> uh we need a display . <EOS> that's not sure <EOS> but it's <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah may maybe because you're <EOS> because yeah if you use the functions your hand will block the display . <EOS>
oh right . <EOS> mm . what they cost . <EOS> um , i i don't believe i know , um . <EOS> i'm i'm i'm hoping that my personal coach is gonna give me some advice on that , if you're asking me , but <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> be because then we would ha ha figure out how much we had to play with in terms of user interface and this look and feel idea . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> maybe ten channels , yeah at the most . <EOS> okay . <EOS> mm . <EOS> and uh basically uh <EOS> it depends <EOS> like the remote with l_c_d_ display for browsing <EOS> because you have multiple functionalities <EOS> for example you are watching a movie , and uh uh you are having a universal remote control and you want to uh you don't know really which functionality is now , <EOS> so i am using the t_v_ so every time i use it , it could be like , <EOS> for example i can use a simple toggle switch , and a display , <EOS> so i press it so the display says , okay , i'm in t_v_ or d_v_d_ or whatever it is , instead of having three keys separately for four keys , <EOS> to model the functionalities will increase actually , <EOS> and for you and you might want <EOS> you don't want separate keys for all of them . <EOS> you can't . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> um welcome to our second meeting . <EOS> this is the functional design meeting . <EOS> and i hope you all had a good individual working time . <EOS> okay , let's get started . <EOS> okay , here's the agenda for the meeting . <EOS> after the opening um i am going to fulfil the role of secretary , take the meeting minutes . <EOS> and we're gonna have three presentations , one from each of you . <EOS> then we're gonna discuss some new project requirements . <EOS> um gonna come to a decision on the functions of the remote control . <EOS> and then we're gonna close up the meeting . <EOS> and we're gonna do this all in about forty minutes . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> so , are things we are we have uh speak about before . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> and um so you you can go <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> after . <EOS> and there is a fashion watchers in paris and milan that have detected the following trends , <EOS> uh fruits and vegetables will be the most important theme for clothes , shoes , and furnitures . <EOS> so , maybe if our remote control have to be a fruit form or vegetable form <EOS> something like that , or <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> okay , so <EOS> let's remember there's a nokia phone which changeable panels . <EOS> mm yeah , okay , <EOS> so that would be the option <EOS> . i don't know <EOS> i don't have a nokia phone , <EOS> but <EOS> do you like it ? <EOS>
and it'd it'd be a small vocabulary speech recognition system , <EOS> like a <EOS> oh right , okay . <EOS> uh well that kind of takes back the r_f_ the r_f_ remote sort of idea as well . <EOS> um . <EOS> okay . <EOS> five minutes . <EOS> okay . <EOS> decisions . <EOS> uh , votes , let's vote . <EOS> who wants t_f_t_ ? <EOS> no-one does . <EOS> excellent , <EOS> so we'll go with speech recognition , yeah ? <EOS> um , speech recognition , limited buttons , organic design . <EOS>
yeah but , it is still something uh you have to buy <EOS> and that is um not maybe very <EOS> and , and that's one of the that's one of the shock i mean there are people that have a remote control and they are worried that it's going to break and they put some extra plastic around it . <EOS> that's people they actually do it themselves . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> i i was thinking that the remote the um sort of default functions for the joystick would be up and down for uh volume , left and right for channels . <EOS> we <EOS> do you think that people will get mixed up , <EOS> like , <EOS> they'll be looking at this screen and that screen <EOS> and then , you know , trying to get everything working , <EOS> would it be a bit confusing ? <EOS>
we are selling it to an existing market . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah <EOS> but we're not putting some there's no no putting anything in in the place of teletext . <EOS> that's the problem . <EOS> that's <EOS> yeah , <EOS> and and , <EOS> yeah , <EOS> and and we're also marketing a product . it's what i'm seeing is a is a mid-range cost product . <EOS> so so w we can't go and pump a whole bunch of technology into this thing <EOS> because all of a sudden we are gonna have cost overruns . <EOS> so if we drop if we are gonna choose to drop teletext , again what are we adding to the product that makes it marketable ? <EOS>
why you go <EOS> it has to be fashion . <EOS> okay . <EOS> so you have to <EOS> yeah . <EOS> it has to be a fashion <EOS> and really be uh the image of the society . <EOS> just when you enter you say oh , oh , it's real reaction . <EOS> think it's a re reaction remote control , so . <EOS> and also it has to be attractive , of course , <EOS> because if you want to sale to sell the remote control . <EOS>
oh <EOS> for for for <EOS> i don't know what it mean . <EOS> just <EOS> i just think if we uh <EOS> to gather , or to uh work together , uh or new ideas for <EOS> i dunno . <EOS> for remote control probably . <EOS> no , for the project . <EOS>
mm we can do it afterwards , so <EOS> yes . <EOS> let's play minesweeper . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i found it as well . <EOS> ti-din ti-din . <EOS> one two three four five six seven cameras . <EOS> mm not bad . <EOS> so that was it . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> well my presentation is a bit uh sucky . <EOS> well you can improvise right ? <EOS> uh which one is it ? technical functions ? <EOS> yeah a little bit . <EOS> uh no . <EOS> this one ? <EOS> no no . <EOS> functional requirements ? <EOS>
yep . <EOS> yes . <EOS> um and we can interview current users and future users . what w what would they like to see uh on a new remote control ? um especially for future users , <EOS> uh i'm thinking of early adopters , <EOS> because they they use new technology first , <EOS> and they play with a lot of tools and stuff <EOS> so maybe they have some good ideas to uh to add . <EOS>
okay , any last <EOS> yeah . <EOS> worries , queries ? <EOS> twelve thirty . <EOS> okay . <EOS> s s <EOS> i know what you're thinking . <EOS> okay then , lunchtime , <EOS> yay . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> that's good . <EOS> okay , that felt a bit more like a something with order and and reason to it than the last one . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> we can take it from there . <EOS> yeah , i agree uh , <EOS> we can take it from there . <EOS> w what it's gonna be . <EOS> a <EOS> okay . <EOS> and then you s then you can delete uh <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> right , <EOS> the triple a_s are the smallest you can get are they not , right ? <EOS> they are . <EOS> okay . <EOS> oh i see . <EOS> okay . <EOS> now the main components i came up with um were obviously the power source for the batteries <EOS> 'cause otherwise it's not gonna work , <EOS> uh as i said about the w which batteries we were gonna choose , we can uh discuss that later <EOS> and then you obviously need something to decode the information that you're putting in from from the controller <EOS> and to turn it into an i uh infrared signal which we're going to use to send the information . now these have a wireless range of up to about five metres <EOS> which is sort of suitable for anyone who's watching the t_v_ <EOS> unless they're in a cinema , which not most people do <EOS> so as we're applying to the most audience that should be fine . <EOS> and then i was uh just had a quick look at the external design <EOS> but i d i left that mostly to the uh interface designer . <EOS>
so lots of choices , <EOS> what do we think ? <EOS> 'kay . <EOS> uh or sponge , i guess , isn't on there , right . <EOS> organic sponge . <EOS> well . <EOS> mm . i'm not sure about the sponge . <EOS> well , i mean like la latex has a kinda spongy feeling to it , <EOS> doesn't it . <EOS> um <EOS>
mm . <EOS> so perhaps the the joystick the the keyboard idea might work better . <EOS> but then again , people like to use one hand to flip <EOS> and one hand to hold their soda , <EOS> so maybe maybe we <EOS> like <EOS> yeah . <EOS> true . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> 'kay . <EOS> and we were gonna think about the port and an alarm for getting it lost , <EOS> things like that , <EOS> um and our market was going to be young , business , kind of range . <EOS> okay , so shall we start with the first presentation ? <EOS> yes if you feel <EOS>
cause for example yeah . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> but we do we do we we <EOS> we cannot rely one hundred percent on these features to u to use the controller , <EOS> but with the features of our controller such as you have the feature of voice recognition in your mobile but you seldom use it , your mobile , <EOS> but you when you choose a new mobile , you choose the one with voice recognition . <EOS> that's <EOS> the feature is not one hundred percent reliable , <EOS> but it's a feature to distinguish our product from our from other products . <EOS>
i thought it was good , <EOS> but uh yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah <EOS> well , <EOS> okay . <EOS> not too much , not too too too too . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> and creativity ? <EOS> well , <EOS> when we look at this i'd say we have been creative , <EOS> huh ? <EOS> but <EOS>
looks strange . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> uh the basic colour is uh yellow and red . <EOS> yellow is uh our company colour , <EOS> uh red it's uh is more attractive . <EOS> so we used two basic colour , yellow and red . <EOS> and the shape , there's two basic shape . <EOS> the first is a circle and the second is a triangle s piece . <EOS> it's <EOS> we call it a mushroom design . <EOS> it's looks like some mushroom , so we call it mushroom design . <EOS> so this is a introduction of our product . <EOS> next a mo <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> or is it just a television that we're supposed to be doing ? <EOS> oh i w um <EOS> basically i'll get back to you on that . <EOS> but it seems to me sensible , <EOS> 'cause as you rightly said , there's nothing more annoying than having three or four devices littered about the uh about the room . <EOS> and uh <EOS>
okay . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i mean that's another question , <EOS> where are we gonna <EOS> we we should have the logo somewhere on it . <EOS> mm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> should also fit the batteries , <EOS> which we haven't <EOS> oh yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
yeah , yeah , yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> so it's very <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> so <EOS> are we <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> we're done . <EOS> yeah , we're done . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> if it was um circular um with the sort of that sort of the sort of early idea we had , with the way that was more like that , whereas this is just a one-handed thing <EOS> that you sort of almost wrap round the thumb . <EOS> so you'd have your , <EOS> you'd put your hand into there with the thumb there . <EOS> and then your thumb would do <EOS> you'd have all the buttons sort of round here . <EOS> and that i think could work . on any hand . if you just had it like wrapped round there . left or right . <EOS>
no . <EOS> a hinge . <EOS> be like a copper hinge or you know . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> but you also have to d start watching out for the weight , <EOS> 'cause depending on how much the the flip screen will add to the weight of the remote control , you don't want it to start getting too heavy . <EOS> but that's the general layout with the general functionalities , if we come up with something else . <EOS> as you can see , there's still lots of space on the actual remote control <EOS> and if you do it customisably , you can make this thing fairly small or fairly o large , depending on personal preferences . <EOS>
s <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah yeah yeah . <EOS> well it could just be simple instead of being a l mass . <EOS> because , the other thing , i didn't tell you all my presentation , is that people find it find that it's a big waste of time to have to learn how to use your remote <EOS> and that's another thing they complained about . <EOS> um , what other buttons were there ? <EOS> volume <EOS> oh we've ts just said that . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> maybe it would be more complex to configure it to be simple than creating a simple product . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah . yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> and there are <EOS> another thing is that if we make something that's simple and easy to use that's bas to use immediately that means that it will be exactly the same as everything else . <EOS> all right ? <EOS>
thanks . <EOS> okay . <EOS> do you have any um i idea about costs at this point ? <EOS> br <EOS> no , i don't have any idea about what each component costs . <EOS> um yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> 'cause that's something to consider , i guess , <EOS> if we're if we're using more advanced technology , it might increase the price . <EOS>
pressure . <EOS> i'm guessing a turtle . <EOS> no . <EOS> i'm kidding . <EOS> i say good guess . <EOS> uh <EOS> why a turtle ? <EOS> because of its shell . <EOS> because it's slow . <EOS> yeah i was a bit slow too . <EOS> so <EOS>
f_ five . <EOS> okay . <EOS> go jurgen . <EOS> you pressed alt f_ four ? <EOS> oh . <EOS> what is this ? <EOS> oh no . <EOS> how do i uh <EOS> no no no . i pressed the mouse button . <EOS> oh great . <EOS> it's th <EOS> that's the self-destruct button . <EOS>
sure . <EOS> and if anything you need anytime so please either you can call me , or just send me email , or uh just come and uh knock my door , okay , <EOS> so i'm available here . <EOS> it's good ? <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay , thanks for coming and uh i wish you a nice time then . <EOS>
alright , <EOS> so um <EOS> decisions , what the <EOS> okay <EOS> deci decisions on energy i'm thinking is based on the battery . <EOS> um i dunno , <EOS> what do people think about this kinetic battery idea ? <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> i think it's awesome . i think it's really cool . <EOS>
uh indeed indeed . <EOS> and and and the hard disk recorders . <EOS> so <EOS> d_v_d_s and v_c_r_s ? <EOS> mm . <EOS> um , furthermore , uh , w we need really need to interest uh y younger customers <EOS> and then with younger customers i mean people uh below the age of forty , <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> that's pretty uh pretty normal , <EOS> that's what you do with a remote control . <EOS> um the second , teletext , <EOS> uh and the third , uh volume controls . <EOS> um , i think it's good uh that we know what the user want wants , <EOS> uh at least the these three points have to be uh very clear . <EOS>
yeah , <EOS> but a telephone <EOS> okay , yeah . <EOS> but a telephone also have a l_c_d_ and and it's about t two hundred euros . <EOS> so uh <EOS> yeah , <EOS> so uh <EOS> we gotta de <EOS> we have to decide on that . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> that was this ? <EOS>
good morning . <EOS> sorry ? <EOS> yeah , <EOS> busy job . <EOS> good morning . <EOS> so oh , <EOS> good morning everyone . <EOS> good morning . <EOS> good morning . <EOS> i'd uh like to welcome you to our first meeting . <EOS> i've prepared a little presentation . <EOS> my name is <EOS> and uh i hope you will introduce yourself uh in a few minutes , <EOS> as will i . <EOS> um i'm the project manager of this project , <EOS> and uh , well <EOS> i will tell you on what actually is the project . <EOS> this is uh the agenda for our first meeting . <EOS> um this is the opening , <EOS> then we will get <EOS> i will hope we will get acquainted to each other . <EOS> we'll do a little tool training with these two things . <EOS> we'll take a look at the project plan . <EOS> uh there will be time for discussion . <EOS> actually we have to discuss <EOS> because we have to create a product . <EOS> and then we will close this session . <EOS>
but it's <EOS> actually , i think i cannot go with uh <EOS> you you <EOS> d doesn't it work ? <EOS> maybe someo <EOS> maybe maybe anna , maybe you can start . <EOS> then he can maybe find out to get his cord right . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS>
yeah , <EOS> the last minute , yeah , <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so <EOS> i would say <EOS> you said uh targ target groups , <EOS> what does that mean ? <EOS> yeah ? <EOS> um <EOS> as uh who it is that we're going to be trying to sell this thing to , <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
so <EOS> i <EOS> are there some other very important things to to do well , <EOS> so <EOS> to specify in this first phase of of the project . <EOS> so <EOS> the browse function , as you m mentioned . <EOS> mm . yeah . oth yeah . <EOS>
remote control . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> and um <EOS> if you look in holland at the whole generation of forty plus , fifty plus , it it's the the biggest share of the of the whole population now . <EOS> yes <EOS> but it's not the biggest part of the market . <EOS>
it . yeah , if we can afford it . yeah . <EOS> oh , okay <EOS> postpone further discussion to uh our next meeting , <EOS> because we're running out of time . <EOS> um <EOS> for now , we're having a lunch break , <EOS> oh . <EOS> and then there will be uh half an hour for the uh next share of individual work . <EOS> i will uh write uh minutes , if i can create them out of this . <EOS> and uh put them in the the project documents uh folder . <EOS> and here are the individual actions for the for the other roles . <EOS> and of course specific instructions will be sent to you again by your uh personal coach . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> oh okay . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> ergonomic , definitely ergonomic . <EOS> and it might actually help with the repetitive stress injury as well . <EOS> okay . <EOS> it could cause another type of repetitive stress injury though . but yeah <EOS> , no i mean it's a different movement <EOS> so yeah . <EOS> um and the feel of it , i mean , we've made this out of play doh , which is representing the , you know , the rubber , and the spongy rubberness . <EOS> um 'cause it was said before in the material specification that this the this anti-r_s_i_ um material is often used in stress balls <EOS> so this has got a you know a bit of give to it , <EOS> and it just feels feels different . <EOS> would you like to feel it yourselves ? <EOS> how it fits in the palm of your hand ? <EOS>
brilliant . <EOS> that's handy . <EOS> okay . <EOS> so that's quite cool . <EOS> uh personal preferences just some imagination , <EOS> the raised symbols i thought were good , <EOS> the l_c_d_ , it does look smart , but i think maybe for our budget , <EOS> do you think that would be a bit too expensive to have the <EOS>
okay . <EOS> do we wanna go for batteries or a stand like the one that we saw illustrated earlier ? <EOS> oh the base , yeah . <EOS> the base , the charging base with rechargeable batteries ? <EOS> i think the p <EOS> i always feel like first i wanna know what it looks like , before <EOS> 'cause if it's something really really small , then it's sort of harder to imagine a base for it , <EOS> that was p quite a s substantial size sort of standing up <EOS>
there's more vomit there . <EOS> it's so minging . <EOS> it really is <EOS> uh . <EOS> does <EOS> uh yeah . <EOS> ready ? <EOS> minging ? <EOS> nice . <EOS> alright . yep . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> slide it in there . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i'm going local . going local . <EOS> i have to be here for three years <EOS> so i might as well get the terminology right . <EOS>
speakers in the remote cont <EOS> like , you want to find it , you shout <EOS> oh yeah . <EOS> control , <EOS> and it answers is i'm here ? or <EOS> uh yeah <EOS> that's <EOS> it just beeps . <EOS> that would be enough . <EOS> something very cheap . <EOS>
shall i ? <EOS> okay . <EOS> we just connect up . <EOS> yep . <EOS> thank you . <EOS> there we go . <EOS> okay um <EOS> so we decided on our market <EOS> and so this feedback from the marketing department is really about trend watching . um <EOS> the methods we used to decide on uh current trends and so on , market trends , were that we did our traditional uh our usual market research study uh with a hundred subjects <EOS> and the the general feedback from them is that the most <EOS> im uh w i'm sorry <EOS> i'm slightly tongue-tied after lunch , <EOS> sorry project manager . <EOS> um we decided on the most important aspect i uh required in a remote control device <EOS> and we'll come to that later . <EOS> so that was one of the first things we did . <EOS> also with our company um being forerunners in uh putting fashion into technology , we also looked at a fashion update um using our consultants on fashion and design in paris and milan . <EOS>
oh right . <EOS> i don't know what that stuff is . <EOS> so something with give to it . <EOS> okay . <EOS> and <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> and that might be quite durable and easy to chuck around . <EOS> and the colour is yellow , right ? <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> i have just brief uh down few uh components which we require for the remote control uh construction . <EOS> uh the first one is case to keep all the components like integrated circuit , battery , etcetera , etcetera , <EOS> it's like <EOS>
mm , yeah . <EOS> um and so <EOS> we have to decide what's gonna make our product different . <EOS> e <EOS> the unique style , maybe have it light up <EOS> so it's visible in the dark , <EOS> um the changeable face-plates , <EOS> and the lighting up and visible i was <EOS> when we were talking about havi losing it , <EOS> maybe to have a button on the television that you press and it maybe if it makes a noise or lights up or something like that , <EOS> so it's easier to find if someone has hidden under the couch or something like that . <EOS> so <EOS> that's my presentation . yeah . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> uh we didn't , no . <EOS> no . <EOS> i d i didn't personally . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> w i i got um or or three things basically , um relating to the remote being only for t_v_ . <EOS> we discussed that last time <EOS> and in actual fact that was pr pretty well what we came up with anyway . <EOS> so in fact it actually f we won't be forestalled in a sense . <EOS> um we've got uh teletext outdated . <EOS> um did you get any information on that ? <EOS> right and the corporate image was the uh final thing . <EOS> so i i got that in email form . <EOS> um .
well <EOS> you need some kind of c_p_u_ , i guess . <EOS> i suppose so . <EOS> mm , i don't i dunno i don't think that's <EOS> it is a simple c_p_u_ <EOS> but it doesn't <EOS> yeah yeah okay <EOS> but i d i i don't know if nor o s it's quite a simple l_c_d_ . <EOS> yeah , it's quite a simple l_c_d_ screen . <EOS> i think they don't need that big of c_p_u_ . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> seven ? <EOS> six . <EOS> yeah , okay . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> is it is it robust ? <EOS> yeah , <EOS> it's rubber , made of rubber , <EOS> i think it's m it's uh more rubber than uh other remote control . <EOS> uh f yeah , <EOS> it's ru it's rubber . <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> alright . <EOS> luckily as we are . <EOS> okay , well <EOS> thank you very much , for now , <EOS> and uh have a nice lunch , huh ? <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> lunch . <EOS> okay . <EOS> food . <EOS> should we put this back in our rooms , <EOS> or uh ? <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yes , okay . <EOS> she has the small legs . <EOS> th thank you , matthew . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> thank you , matthew . <EOS> perfect . <EOS> it's a very big rat . or a very small cat . <EOS> oh <EOS> a rat , okay . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i like it like that . <EOS> yeah , okay . <EOS> let's move on to the project evaluation . <EOS> project process . satisfaction with for example the room for creativity , leadership , teamwork , the means , any new ideas found . <EOS> so i guess what we're gonna talk about here is just evaluating how we created this project , <EOS> the information we got on the news , how we used it , <EOS> if we were able to um , you know , use our creativity with the information , <EOS> um how how well i guess i led it , <EOS> um the how well we worked together as a team , <EOS> um the digital pens , <EOS> the whiteboard . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> and it also use a programmable channel and vocabulary , <EOS> so we didn't define the vocabulary <EOS> so it's up to the user to define <EOS> so <EOS> sorry ? <EOS> and then uh because of the chil because children are using the device so we have also a a of t_v_ programmes by genre , <EOS> and this can be used by the adult or by the children . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah , less likely to <EOS> sounds reasonable . <EOS> whereas just the fact that it was a rubber case is probably less less of something that y you're gonna end up hating in a year , you know . <EOS> if you're going for fashion trends like that they'll need t you'd have to have interchangeable cases <EOS> so that you could <EOS> or 'cause otherwise someone's gonna have to buy a complete new remote rather than just a case . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> no <EOS> y you do the minutes first , <EOS> or ? <EOS> what ? <EOS> no ? <EOS> i i think i will let uh our user interface designer speak first , mister david jordan . <EOS> okay . <EOS> yep . <EOS> so , <EOS> we'll <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> has it be has <EOS> does it has to b have to be um uh like a different form than a normal remote control <EOS> or <EOS> yeah , <EOS> i don't i don't know i don't know <EOS> if we <EOS> well <EOS> i think we have to look at that , <EOS> 'cause well you can do the standard way , <EOS> but then you won't <EOS>
that is that is a good idea actually . <EOS> sor sort of a second . <EOS> yeah , yeah . <EOS> like a hidden panel . <EOS> okay . <EOS> uh not quite , but i guess . <EOS> keep the other buttons but hide them away . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> and that'll be better for the older generation as well <EOS> 'cause , well my dad doesn't like anything that you've got to kinda flick through a menu , <EOS> but he can pretty much read a button if it's displayed properly . <EOS>
you can make it very special , to create our own um looks , <EOS> but it's very hard to <EOS> yeah <EOS> n <EOS> uh if if we want to make it special , we probably have to do a lot of testing , if it really works . <EOS>
'kay . check . <EOS> you must still have it open . <EOS> kijke <EOS> 'kay , so . <EOS> we're going to j discuss the functional requirements of the remote , <EOS> that m <EOS> that means that functions user n want to have on the remote control , <EOS> or just <EOS> yeah , and the users , actually . <EOS> the methods i i prefer is we're going to look which section of the users we are going to focus a l on more . <EOS>
i don't think any of us remember the fifties . <EOS> is it like a crank thing or something . <EOS> mm . <EOS> well , there's sometimes combinations , i mean , like calculators do combinations of battery with but also using some solar power . <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
yeah 'cause if if we can make this unit upgradable then we're <EOS> yeah but then we talk about changing the warranty concept and everything , <EOS> but that's that was just an idea i had . <EOS> uh to me the only additions <EOS> yeah , the plus there's the the risk of making it unusable as well , or making it less <EOS> b because at the moment it's actually very straightforward to look at all the buttons , <EOS> you know what they do , it's very simple , and it just works . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> so the <EOS> yeah , yeah , yeah . <EOS> so then our target age group would be the nineteen to thirty five range , <EOS> what was it ? <EOS> the the buzzer you mean , <EOS> yeah , for sure , yeah . <EOS> locator . <EOS>
uh with the format menu . <EOS> oh okay . <EOS> and use different colours etcetera . <EOS> it's a giraffe . yeah . <EOS> are you serious ? <EOS> and what's that supposed to be ? <EOS> should it be one <EOS> oh yeah . oh yeah <EOS> four legs . <EOS> uh-huh . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> it's true . <EOS> oh my god . <EOS> i tried to uh the l_c_d_ screen i tried to sort of to draw . <EOS> i thought uh at least uh the icon for the volume . <EOS> i don't know if there is an icon for the program , <EOS> but <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so uh <EOS> and then the buttons above and uh below <EOS> the and the and the mute button also recognisable as an icon . <EOS>
okay , that's why i like dogs . <EOS> right , um . <EOS> well i've not actually had too many pets uh over my uh time <EOS> 'cause to be honest with you uh i'm not too keen on them anyway . <EOS> not to worry . <EOS> so what my daughters have got at the moment is they've got uh a few fish <EOS> and so hopefully um won't prove too difficult to draw . <EOS> uh <EOS>
yeah , see the budget . <EOS> we'll just send all of our manufacturing to some nice poor country <EOS> and cut some of the prices that way . <EOS> wales . <EOS> wales , for example . <EOS> mm . cool , okay . right , okay . <EOS> fabulous , <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay , cool . <EOS> so what we're gonna do is prefer prepare the evaluation of the new design . <EOS> um so we're gonna be using a seven point scale , <EOS> so one is , you know , yes , it totally meets with that requirement <EOS> and seven is , no , it really doesn't , we need to go back and start again . <EOS>
well we had the favourites list , and the scroll bar , and we have the cradle , and the r uh remote call feature . <EOS> oh . <EOS> yeah we came up with quite a bit . <EOS> bunch of new ideas . <EOS> and for the meeting room , has anyone got any more <EOS>
what would it achieve ? <EOS> well <EOS> l_c_ well i'd <EOS> when you used to mention the l_c_d_ i'd think i wonder what that would be about . <EOS> and the th the thing i could see it helping with would be if it was somehow connected with um listings . <EOS> so as you scroll through , 'cause we said we might have a jog dial , so as you scroll through your stations you can y it actually tells you what it is . <EOS>
mm okay . <EOS> that's fine . <EOS> but uh is uh uh <EOS> so this is a regular chip incl and and a sample speaker . <EOS> okay . <EOS> so that's both . <EOS> come on , it's perfect . uh twelve point three point three . <EOS> yeah , and single curved curved . <EOS>
but <EOS> you mean , charging it by shaking the banana . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i think rechargeable batteries will take care of the power thing . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> to bring the cost <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay so we we stick to battery , one . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> that would be cool . <EOS> i was thinking that like a flip . <EOS> f flip it open and you've got all the buttons , or you flip it closed and you've just got the basic buttons on the outside maybe . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS>
okay . okay . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> but suppose you have a family watching t_v_ , and if they want to use their private remote control in the same time , do you think it will work ? everybody wanting to change channel in the same time ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> say it for the camera . <EOS> lo sort of loch ness banana . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> right , right . <EOS> cool yeah . <EOS> well , nice to have uh options at least . <EOS> 'kay and <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
like a little lightning in it . <EOS> okay , <EOS> um <EOS> the little lightning bolt in it , very cute . <EOS> what <EOS> we call that one the rhombus , <EOS> uh the rhombus . <EOS> um this one is known as the potato , <EOS> uh it's <EOS>
now uh we are ready for the presentation of the prototype . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> just the look like , <EOS> the button part i'll explain . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> uh so this is our what uh we have made . <EOS> this is a model of the remote control which we are going to build . <EOS> uh this is us in a snail shape so uh it it is attractive <EOS> um and it's <EOS> it's blue in colour <EOS> uh bright and uh it has yellow buttons and all the different colour buttons <EOS> so it is a uh uh a looks-wise it is beautiful . <EOS> uh and also compact in shape . <EOS> uh um and also i it it will be easily fit into into the hands and you can access all the buttons easily . <EOS>
alright i'm heather <EOS> and i've i said i'm your project manager , <EOS> um well you can pretty much read what it is that i'm doing . <EOS> but um um <EOS> yeah . <EOS> and uh tool training is one thing that we're going to be doing today , <EOS> um um as well as planning the project , <EOS> how we're going to , uh , create this product , <EOS> and , um , discuss , um , our aims and objects of this , <EOS> uh which brings us to our next subject , <EOS> is , um , um , <EOS> as a team we're going to be designing and creating a new kind of remote control . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> this i this is one such interface which can be created . <EOS> ho who wants to go next um ? <EOS> yeah , maybe . <EOS> mm-hmm . okay , <EOS> and you <EOS> participant two . <EOS> uh okay . <EOS> uh the next one , sorry . <EOS> it's it was the old one . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> okay i'm <EOS> yeah . sure , that's a good idea . <EOS> okay . <EOS> i'm catherine with a c_ . <EOS> c_a_t_h_ e_r_ i_n_e_ . <EOS> okay , <EOS> and <EOS> gabriel . <EOS> uh gabriel . <EOS> e_l_ is it ? <EOS> e_l_ . <EOS>
within the next like twenty years is very slim . <EOS> in addition people indicated that teletext simply was an important feature for the remote control . <EOS> so i think it's pretty dumb to put no teletext feature on it . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i'm pretty much against it . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> for u_i_d_ the technical functions design . <EOS> marketing , the user requirement specification . <EOS> specific instructions will be sent to you by your person by your personal coach . <EOS> so . <EOS> are we all clear what objectives we're looking to meet in the next thirty minutes ? <EOS> and i guess i'll try and write up some minutes of uh this meeting to uh to give it to you for the next meeting . <EOS>
but can you change those too , with uh the switch ? <EOS> yes . <EOS> no , no . <EOS> make them <EOS> no , just make them black or grey or something . <EOS> yeah , grey . just dark grey i think . <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> small scroll wheel . <EOS> so it won't uh stick out much . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> maybe the ones we are going to draw there . <EOS> maybe we have to ask uh to the the mm to her if it has if it can work better than this . <EOS> because it doesn't work properly . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> imagine d are you right handed ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> imagine you're doing it with your left hand , <EOS> i don't think it's too <EOS> yeah , it's not <EOS> but we can have both uh <EOS> yeah . <EOS> have them in stock . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> you know . <EOS> that's just really good id <EOS> yep . <EOS> uh , <EOS> sure . <EOS> i remember when the first remote control my my family had was on a cable . <EOS> actually had a cable between it and the t_v_ <EOS> and big like buttons that sort of like , like on a blender or something . <EOS> and um , you know , <EOS> when i think about what they are now , it's better , <EOS> but actually it's still kind of , i dunno , like a massive junky thing on the table . <EOS> maybe we could think about how , could be more , you know , streamlined . s <EOS>
yeah , the drawings are are hard to make , i think . <EOS> yeah , it's i it should be more accurate . <EOS> precise . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> and uh i think it would be great if you could edit it from , just with a mouse , from where you're sitting . <EOS>
no . <EOS> yes . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> i don't know if the they have that anywhere else , though . <EOS> i think the aim is better to use uh the whole world and britain , yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , we can leave that . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> and you have the scroll button inside . <EOS> okay . <EOS> but why do we have to round it on the t bottom then ? <EOS> of <EOS> skip that one as well . <EOS> yes . just a simple scrollb <EOS> yeah . <EOS> doesn't have to be . <EOS>
you dunno ? <EOS> oh wow . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> that is lovely . <EOS> hey yeah , <EOS> i said ninja homer . <EOS> what did you call it ? <EOS> ninja homer . <EOS> see it looks like homer simpson <EOS> huh , huh . <EOS> logo . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> and <EOS> and the button button's part uh will be explained by f francina . <EOS> okay . <EOS> now the um <EOS> we decided upon including certain features on our remote . <EOS> now these features includes the s um signal emitting uh signal it's the led or l_e_d_ the infrared . <EOS> now uh we have included the switch on and off button . <EOS>
on your coffee table , <EOS> it's not like an eye sore , that kind of thing . <EOS> battery ? do we need a long-life battery ? <EOS> battery battery use . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> but i think that goes in with simplicity and ease of use really . <EOS>
mm 'kay . <EOS> um there's the idea of like being able to do it by feel as well as by um by sight . <EOS> you'd you know you're in the dark , you don't wanna be looking at the remote control . <EOS> and the picture particularly is pointing out if you look at the top volume button it's a v_ , <EOS> and so yo you're kind of feeling a v_ like volume up . <EOS> what it really is is a v_ and what it you think it is is down , because the down arrow . <EOS> and so it's like a sort of a criticism you'd probably turn that o the other way up . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> so basically want very simple , right ? <EOS> that's the major idea , as simple as possible . <EOS> yeah . yeah . <EOS> so i just look at some current designs uh on the web , of usually more complicated remote controls . <EOS> and let's look at two of them because uh th even though they have many buttons they look quite simple . <EOS> and in our case we just uh reject the buttons what we don't need and it become even simpler . <EOS>
hi i'm chiara , i'm the um marketing expert . <EOS> um , would you like me to talk about my aims at the moment , or would you like me to just say my name and then we can talk about business later ? <EOS> i think we'll get around to that , yeah . <EOS> so this is just introductions yeah . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> s <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> okay . <EOS> hi . <EOS> so we are here for the detailed design meeting . <EOS> how is everyone ? <EOS> hi . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> so <EOS> we will uh <EOS> i will first present what we are going to do in this meeting . <EOS> then uh i've <EOS> i will also take notes during this meeting <EOS> and i will send you uh a summary then as usual . <EOS> we will then look at the evaluation criteria of the prototype presented by uh our two colleagues <EOS> that make good work . <EOS> and uh then we will see the financial aspects and the cost of the product . <EOS> then we will uh evaluate the product . <EOS>
. <EOS> and they're re-programmable aren't they ? <EOS> you can put on your songs and then put on a different set , <EOS> that's probably why they're expensive , they're like little computers . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> well like since it just has the circle thing , you could make it a qui a kind of cool shape , <EOS> like it could be a cool sort of you know , because it could be circular , you know , or something weird like that , just <EOS>
hi . <EOS> hi . <EOS> hello . <EOS> oh . <EOS> good morning . <EOS> good morning . <EOS> morning . <EOS> good morning . <EOS> uh before i start with the with the meeting i have a few things to tell you about the the setting we're in , <EOS> uh because we're uh being watched by uh big brother . <EOS> so um <EOS> yeah . yeah . <EOS> this <EOS> uh these are cameras , <EOS> so are these . <EOS> this thing uh that looks like a pie , <EOS> are actually all microphones . <EOS>
. yeah . okay . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . maybe you can go to the whiteboard if you have some drawings to do <EOS> i don't know . <EOS> yeah <EOS> but <EOS> mm . <EOS> do i have <EOS> oh yeah . <EOS> now i have enough cables . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> a set of buttons for linear access of medium and a set of buttons for random access . <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah ? <EOS> what do you mean by linear access then ? <EOS> like a video tape goes forward , backwards , uh fast and stuff yeah . <EOS>
uh-huh . <EOS> oh , <EOS> and the tail <EOS> okay . <EOS> fantastic . <EOS> since you're handy as well , <EOS> why don't you do yours next , steph . <EOS> i think it's to get us used to using the pen . <EOS> yes . <EOS> um sure it's not to test our artistic <EOS>
mm . <EOS> and uh the corporate identity should be clear in the design of the remote control . <EOS> and we have to decide on the functions , and on the , let's see what was it , uh the target group . <EOS> we have to make be clear what that is . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> as in within the team or ? <EOS> i think so yeah . <EOS> right so <EOS> it's just kind of a open mic kind of thing or <EOS> okay . <EOS> i think it's i <EOS> mm-hmm , i think so . <EOS> 'kay . <EOS> i think hope i'm not screwing up an experiment . <EOS>
mm 'kay . <EOS> either . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> okay , so most remote controls use graphical interface , <EOS> where you um have got s buttons and you point it rather than having the output as a a stream of text or something . <EOS> um and we also found that there's inconsistent layout , which makes it confusing . <EOS> so i think for our remote control <EOS> there is some inconsistency already in ec existing in between remote controls , <EOS> but i think standard kind of um shape and uh play and those kind of but buttons <EOS> like the the top right for on and off or something , <EOS> i think , people find that important,'cause then it's easy to use . <EOS>
it i yeah , it seems feasible , and it would be something very great . <EOS> so we have the de design , the a good shape , new and so on , <EOS> and we have also the technology thing w will be . <EOS> and even the easy to use thing , <EOS> so it will be perfect . <EOS> so we add also the speech recognition device . <EOS>
yeah , that's great . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> abs okay . <EOS> the colour's very attractive . <EOS> um the um these buttons uh around here are the mute <EOS> no , these the front buttons which are here , are the mute buttons . <EOS> yes , yes . <EOS>
specially distribution , yeah . <EOS> yeah , yeah , maybe . yeah , maybe . if you need to have special colours for remote controls it will cost more . <EOS> uh <EOS> yeah , personalised colour . because you know <EOS> yeah , it will cost little bit more . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> everybody found his place again ? yeah ? <EOS> that's nice . <EOS> okay so <EOS> this is our second meeting . <EOS> and uh <EOS> still failing ? <EOS> yes . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> uh now we're going um into the functional design . <EOS> um important thing of this phase is that we're going to uh try to get an agreement about the user requirements , technical function design , and the working design . so that we can move onto the second uh phase . <EOS> but first this phase . <EOS> um first an announcement . <EOS> there's a little adaptation in the air conditioning system . <EOS> so <EOS>
and uh in the market the people are not really interested with l_c_d_ , without l_c_d_ , with speech recognition interface , or without speech recognition interface , <EOS> but most of the people what they are interested is first thing is , they want to have an fancy look and feel , <EOS> it should be very fancy with colourful <EOS> and uh very handy to hold . <EOS> and the second thing is it should be much more technologically innovative . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> now for that , uh a remote controller should have a switch on off button by which a user can sit anywhere in the room in front of the t_v_ and he can control the functionalities different functionalities of the t_v_ . <EOS> there should be a signal <EOS> uh something like a radio wave or a infrared light or a led which can be used to change the different functionalities in the television <EOS> if the user wants to uh change the channels or increase the volume he can change it . <EOS>
mm . sounds interesting . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i don't think there's any rules about it yet . so <EOS> maybe our personal coach will have something to say about that . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> or or you know can we produ <EOS> can we sell a remote control phone for twenty five pounds or less ? <EOS>
colour uh <EOS> okay . <EOS> uh to make this side um like mm the right colour . <EOS> um bit like so uh um in the form of your hand . <EOS> so um <EOS> uh it's an <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so so <EOS> the remote control have to um lay in your hand . <EOS> so uh <EOS> it's possib um yeah for s so and <EOS>
yeah the d <EOS> we haven't um uh specified where the speaker or the microphone will be placed . <EOS> that depends on the uh s design of the circuit board inside and uh what room is left um <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i think the microphone is on on the top , uh on the middle , the under the flip . <EOS>
well it's it's it's pretty new , <EOS> pretty novel solution for a for a remote control really , all this flipping open thing and <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i don't know , <EOS> i don't go shopping for remote controls that often , <EOS> maybe somebody's already though of it . <EOS>
yeah , we're thinking about it . <EOS> uh on a mobile phone , in the dark uh <EOS> it lights up . everything lights up . <EOS> that's a good idea . <EOS> everything lights up . <EOS> why ain't that on a remote control ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
you can just <EOS> yeah , <EOS> but it's it isn't a picture <EOS> or , well , is it ? <EOS> you s <EOS> uh file save as the j_ peg j_ peg . <EOS> okay . <EOS> and uh please put it in the project folder then , huh . <EOS>
but those things as long as we can get those components , <EOS> the block , that that rectangle for the user interface , is where the user comes in <EOS> of <EOS> what what does it look like ? <EOS> what do the buttons look like ? <EOS> uh what does it feel like ? <EOS> that's where the user interface is really coming into its own . <EOS> the technical end is what's actually gonna be in there , <EOS> but also it has to be easy enough to change or repair if something goes wrong .
it <EOS> sixteen euros . <EOS> sixteen euros <EOS> sorry . <EOS> okay . <EOS> so it's well outside the budget then . <EOS> then it's out of budget . <EOS> but the the main point we we talk about that with our uh manufacturer . <EOS> and they say basically that the s_r_ system would be uh something like three francs per item <EOS> so <EOS> three euros <EOS> sorry . <EOS> and um <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> well are you are you tak <EOS> yeah . <EOS> wait , <EOS> but is that separate from what he was saying ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> well <EOS> if it if it was a l_ l_c_d_ on th on the remote , i don't know that you could f that you'd be able to see a <EOS>
so <EOS> again , it's pretty much similar to what i've said in the previous meeting . <EOS> um user really really want a fancy look and feel . <EOS> they're not so so interested in uh functional look and feel , <EOS> okay . <EOS> like the one you've shown , david , with all the buttons and i mean i i it sounds good technically <EOS> but it's it's not what they want <EOS> and uh <EOS>
okay . <EOS> so <EOS> wood . <EOS> and what about the buttons ? <EOS> i think the buttons i pr i prefer , you know , the l_c_d_ you know lighted buttons <EOS> because , you know , it's i don't know um yeah , in the dark , it's fashion <EOS> and it's related to how beautiful it is <EOS> or uh if you want to watch t_v_ in the darkness <EOS> or if you want to lo find your find your your remote control that is lost , you know in the darkness <EOS> it's very easy so , right . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> right . <EOS> but um <EOS> i'm thinking kind of <EOS> but yeah for sure . <EOS> something like not it's not on the button but it's telling you what to do , <EOS> is that what you mean ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
um . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so i think um there's quite a lot of like dolby surround studio , surround sort of things . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> do they have their own do they have their own controls on their actual products , then , <EOS> or do you have to do it via the remote ? <EOS>
but i'm not really one . <EOS> so who is uh marketing , nobody in the market <EOS> marketing is uh , is me . <EOS> it's you , okay . <EOS> so thanks for coming for the meeting first of all , <EOS> and uh we have a long time , just twenty-five minutes to discuss about uh this project and the the project initiation . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> so <EOS> but i mean i think it could be pretty small . <EOS> like , i d i mean , you you want it to be large enough that <EOS> uh . <EOS> you can <EOS>
okay . <EOS> num number <EOS> okay . mm-hmm . <EOS> is too short and nine is too long . <EOS> okay . <EOS> i'm a i i'm <EOS> okay fine , got the idea . <EOS> so to have in order to have enough granularity <EOS> it's in order to have enough granularity in the evaluation . <EOS>
any idea you <EOS> you mentioned that there would be a cost difference . <EOS> um do you have any idea if if this could if the fancy model could be done in twelve euros fifty ? <EOS> yeah , <EOS> i'm afraid i don't have that information available . <EOS> um manufacturing didn't actually give attach any prices to any of this , i'm afraid . <EOS>
put it like this <EOS> square . <EOS> i think it's it's easier to have it something like oh a button uh minus here , plus over here . a minus here , plus over here . <EOS> oh , okay . <EOS> and on here . <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
right . <EOS> um . <EOS> rubber buttons require rubber case . <EOS> and that would fit in with what we want , wouldn't it , for the spongy feel , to have everything rubber . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> uh so , yeah . <EOS> the m the main problem is how f how frequently do the fashions change ? <EOS> 'cause in essence in the production you want things to stay <EOS> you want to basically mint them out <EOS> 'cause if you've got fashion changes and that you're incorporating , then it means that your stock is um is last year's stock <EOS> and therefore you're selling it or having to sell it at a discounted rate which you wouldn't want to do . <EOS> whereas if you kept the product the same but you could have a difference from year to year , uh it seems to me that you could incorporate a fashion statement if you like , rather than changing the whole kit and caboodle . <EOS> you're just changing one aspect like like the standby button or something like that , <EOS> and especially 'cause then you could make it something that <EOS>
well . <EOS> uh-huh . <EOS> you drew it a long time ago ? <EOS> is huh <EOS> ninety one . <EOS> overwhelming . <EOS> no . <EOS> and and why do you want these kind of component ? <EOS> i mean , are they cheap , <EOS> or are they uh reliable ? <EOS> what were your <EOS>
mm . <EOS> yeah <EOS> 'cause you're you're saying that teletext is gonna be an old feature <EOS> and it's not gonna be used anymore anyway pretty soon . <EOS> and new t_v_s will have internet access on them . <EOS> but i think if you're targeting people of forty plus , the chance that they will have a t_v_ with internet access <EOS>
functionality . <EOS> okay so <EOS> look and feel , innovation <EOS> and now it easy to use . <EOS> easy to use . <EOS> mm . <EOS> target . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> and trends . <EOS> oh , <EOS> you following the idea of using the um removable covers on these ? <EOS> is that part of both of them or ? <EOS>
yeah . yeah . <EOS> yeah . yeah , good point . <EOS> yeah . that's probably more what it is . <EOS> what would be a more efficient way of doing it ? <EOS> yeah , and and some of our d_v_d_ players incidentally have them , <EOS> because we have the relationship with our own department , <EOS> but moreover we need to
so , i mean there are <EOS> there are uh cheaper <EOS> this is another multi kinda purpose remote control where it's it's it's very simple , <EOS> there's only a few buttons , but al each of those buttons does something different in a different context . <EOS> so this is something else we might wanna consider , is really kind of limiting the number of buttons , <EOS> because this is the top rating uh universal remote control on on epinions . <EOS> it it's really uh maybe worth thinking about limiting the number of buttons as much as as possible <EOS> um because really i think people want to be able to find the button they're looking for without even looking at the remote control . <EOS> and was saying before about having different size buttons for different you know frequently used uh tasks , <EOS> but i think also you know the location and and shape of the buttons is important , but also the number of buttons . <EOS> so if you have too many buttons it it it increases the the difficulty of finding the one you want . <EOS> so <EOS>
that is true <EOS> but i think there's simply not much to gain on the competition when you when you're making a remote control only for to operate only the t_v_ . <EOS> to operate only the t_v_ yeah . <EOS> 'cause if you have a a remote control only to operate a t_v_ there's simply not a lot of buttons required . <EOS> there's not a lot of functions required <EOS> so most existing remote controls simply don't have a lot of buttons either . <EOS>
yeah . true . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> but but we need good communication about this stuff , <EOS> 'cause i have to f put the components into the design . <EOS> so if i don't know what components to put in , it's kind of hard . <EOS> unit . <EOS>
yeah y y you you wouldn't <EOS> oh okay okay . <EOS> we have done this . <EOS> the interface will be different . <EOS> i see . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> right . <EOS> well here's <EOS> and i i'd <EOS> mm sorry . <EOS> right . <EOS> we he well here's my thing about that . <EOS> if you're in the market for this ultimate remote , you're not gonna go for just a television remote . <EOS> if it can't control if it can't control your your d_v_d_ player and a al if y if you can't get that all-in-one ultimate remote , that just you can throw all your other remotes away . i'm not gonna buy a d seventy-five euro remote . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> um . <EOS> uh evaluation . <EOS> basic point uh have a list of criteria that we need to rate the prototype by . <EOS> um then we will <EOS> it's a seven s um seven seven step kinda evaluation process . <EOS> so um <EOS> not seven steps , <EOS> seven scale . <EOS> so <EOS> after we've finished doing all the ratings for each criteria , <EOS> we average that <EOS> and that will give us some type of uh confidence in our prototype . <EOS> and uh the criteria based on real reactions' kinda goals and policies , marketing strategies , and also those i put together from the user requirements phase . <EOS> 'kay . um <EOS> if you flip the <EOS> so , <EOS> those are the criteria . <EOS> and uh perhaps i could have put 'em a bit better , <EOS> but you notice a few things that we've totally abandoned , <EOS> which means that uh the product will score very badly on some of those points . <EOS> put it mildly . <EOS> so <EOS> we have um true ? <EOS>
uh ? <EOS> it's uh inside its shell . you'll be uh finished sooner . <EOS> no , <EOS> it's uh <EOS> it's a scared turtle . <EOS> no no . <EOS> it's coming up . <EOS> mm . <EOS> uh . <EOS> wow . <EOS> okay , tim . thank you . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> here we go . <EOS> alright , <EOS> the agenda for thi <EOS> oh . <EOS> alright . <EOS> um the agenda for this meeting is um we'll initially have the prototype presentation by our two designers . <EOS> and then we will evaluate it , given the criteria that um that we gave gave it . <EOS> and um talk about our finances , whether we were under or over our budget . <EOS> i have a um a spreadsheet where we can calculate um our prices for every aspect of of what we've made , given our options . <EOS> and um evaluate the product , as a group . <EOS> and um <EOS>
is this for the project or <EOS> well <EOS> , the w main one for me is that uh the process na in a natural f context would not have been interrupted by this necessity to discommunicate ourselves from each other . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah <EOS> if we just had uh <EOS>
oh , <EOS> it depend if it's uh depends who who's using it , who's just sitting there clicking clicking clicking clicking , <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> then they're clicking a lot , yeah . <EOS> um . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> some people are <EOS> if , but i say if if people are getting r_s_i_ from it then uh then uh then then perhaps we're looking at the wrong market <EOS> n <EOS>
yeah . yeah aim for a an income group . <EOS> that's a good point . <EOS> mm-hmm . mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm . <EOS> so maybe it's more useful to d d to define objectives like fashion and simplicity than to find specific target group as far as age is <EOS> because , yeah , things so different will appeal to different people , <EOS> but <EOS>
i'm sure we can fit in . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay yeah , <EOS> you can you can change <EOS> yeah . no . <EOS> yeah okay . <EOS> we just <EOS> nah , <EOS> but they just said we need it . <EOS> uh the battery contacts , like normal batteries ca you can put in . <EOS>
well <EOS> we can't no <EOS> we can't do evaluation 'til we have a design . <EOS> okay <EOS> matthew . nice uh you are here . <EOS> great . <EOS> great . great . <EOS> oh <EOS> ma maybe then you can start now with mm presenting your uh your designs . <EOS>
no . <EOS> you ping . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> well <EOS> not what to do . not what to do . <EOS> well <EOS> i don't know what to do , <EOS> but . <EOS> okay . <EOS> ooh . <EOS> right . <EOS> s <EOS> tough . <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> yeah , my name is francina . <EOS> and i'm uh an user interface <EOS> my role is uh <EOS> the main responsibility is user interface . <EOS> and my role is to design uh a television remote control . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> okay . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> don't worry . <EOS> or <EOS> i suppose i've got quite big hands . <EOS> i like the appeal of it being like a big glob in your hand . <EOS> well <EOS> yeah . <EOS> but you know what i've just thought of there now . <EOS> what <EOS> where's it gonna sit in your living room ? <EOS> is it not gonna fall off the arm of the sofa ? <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah but y you know <EOS> so you have <EOS> yeah . <EOS> uh by pushing zero after after the first one . <EOS> you just push two button , zero and and one . <EOS> and that's <EOS> yeah , <EOS> yeah , yeah , y you you can do it , <EOS> but you can also do it in the b if you you do not wa if you do not want to browsing all the channel you can just p there's also a button here . <EOS>
thank you . <EOS> and we'll see you after lunch . <EOS>
yeah see you later . <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> good luck . <EOS> yeah . thank you . <EOS> well <EOS> good luck . <EOS> what the <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so you don't see all the buttons you else need . <EOS> but it sounds very difficult to use . <EOS> because um the volume and channel is on the on the the bottom of it . <EOS> so you can't use your thumb for it . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> hi team . <EOS> hope you had a good lunch . <EOS> okay we're back for the conceptual design meeting . <EOS> um let's get started . <EOS> 'kay , here is the agenda for today's meeting . <EOS> um we're gonna open it and i'm gonna keep the minutes as project manager . <EOS> we're gonna have three presentations , <EOS> one from each of you again . <EOS> and then we are going to come to decision on the remote control concepts <EOS> and then we're gonna close it up . <EOS> and we have forty minutes again . <EOS> 'kay , and just to reiterate um after this meeting the team will reach a decision on the concepts of the remote control . <EOS>
you don't need to tune it . <EOS> yeah , why not ? <EOS> if it's <EOS> i mean , for example the goo y <EOS> you say we would we would to have a google-like controller . <EOS> because you have new <EOS> yeah . yeah . <EOS> i don't see how adding speech or gesture recognition would make the remote control look more like google . <EOS> google is is simple , <EOS> works fine , <EOS> so i i guess if can have a remote control that is really basic , simple and works fine , it's already a lot . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> oh , right . <EOS> the buttons . <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> we only use ten per cent of our brains . <EOS> good point . <EOS> it's a necessary evil . <EOS> it works . <EOS> ready for the next slide ? <EOS>
okay , uh <EOS> i'm <EOS> uh i'm the industrial designer <EOS> and i uh hope to uh look forward to uh a very uh pleasing uh end of this uh project . <EOS> okay , <EOS> so i . <EOS> me too . <EOS> my name's . <EOS> i'm uh marketing expert . <EOS> my job is in the company to promote company or promote products to the customers . <EOS> so <EOS> i also h hope we have a pleasant uh working with uh with each other . <EOS>
next generation does . <EOS> no . alright . <EOS> n not used anymore . <EOS> okay . <EOS> by the way where did you guys get that newsflash from ? <EOS> i didn't get anything . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . i was wondering uh <EOS> yeah , on on the project uh <EOS>
uh remote control , <EOS> and the other way round . <EOS> and we have to be very uh attent in uh putting the corporate image uh in our product . <EOS> so it has to be visible in our design , in the way our device works . <EOS> and uh we have to be uh very clear on this point as well . <EOS>
'cause then you have <EOS> i don't know if that's one <EOS> that means you can only have twenty five push buttons in total doesn't it ? <EOS> not counting anything , we'd still be in budget . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> that seems unlikely . <EOS> push what uh <EOS> whether whether pushbutton means that p count by button or do we <EOS> i don't think that makes sense . <EOS>
so we're we're not gonna have any sort of display i think uh . <EOS> so , yeah , it's just gonna be just gonna be push-buttons . um . <EOS> just the simple s simple straight set of buttons . <EOS> i think we shall have a limited number of buttons , <EOS> ideally , i mean a a power , channel up , channel down , volume up , volume down , and a numerical keypad . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah , i can do that . <EOS> i will try to show it to everyone , <EOS> that would be more comfortable . <EOS> okay . <EOS> um . <EOS> you send it ? <EOS> it's participant one ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> uh this is this email . <EOS>
well , function f_ eight . <EOS> no <EOS> oh . <EOS> yeah , w it it just takes a wee while . <EOS> yeah , it just takes a second uh . <EOS> come on . <EOS> right . okay . . okay . <EOS> well , for our marketing report uh we observed remote control users in a usability lab , <EOS> and also gave <EOS> so this is research <EOS> and we also gave participants um questionnaires to fill out . <EOS> um total number of people tested were a hundred just so you know , <EOS> so that hundred people were tested and these were the findings . <EOS> so seventy five per cent of users find the remote control ugly . <EOS> okay , so they don't like the look of the remote control . <EOS> um eighty f eighty per cent of them would spend more money if the rem remote control looked really cool and fancy . <EOS> so i think we all agree with that . <EOS> um current remote controls do not match well with the operating behaviour of the user . <EOS> so , they don't like like the way they operate <EOS> it doesn't like match how people behave . <EOS> um per cent of the users say that they only use ten per cent of the buttons on a remote , <EOS> so probably if you have like one , two , three , four , five , the whole up to z ten , they probably don't use those , <EOS> they only use the up and down channel . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> no . <EOS> yeah , since they're not at the meeting i think it's in out of courtesy we should first ask them . <EOS> yes . <EOS> and i'll try to <EOS> yes . <EOS> bu i ju just before finishing uh , i mean , we have a cafeteria or we don't eat at all ? <EOS>
i don't actually think we need the um the numeric keypad <EOS> because if you m <EOS> because one of the menus that we could have available um v via via the l_c_d_ is one where you scroll through channels , <EOS> so if there's something f <EOS> and be bear in mind since this isn't meant to work for um <EOS>
so maybe it's for some money we can utilise for our uh marketing , for the sales , okay , and uh <EOS> well , it just depends on if we're gonna add a o <EOS> on this pr provisionary cost analysis , we do not have a l_c_ display . <EOS> l_c_ display is gonna be very expensive , <EOS> it's gonna be <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm , i think we all know what we need to do now . <EOS> s <EOS> this gives you all the details ? <EOS> okay . right well . <EOS> it's um we're we've still couple of minutes until our meeting's due to finish . <EOS>
hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> okay . <EOS> right well that's something that we can be aware of . <EOS> is that <EOS> so so what are we deciding to do here ? <EOS> um . <EOS> i think because there's already um very good voice recognition technology out there , and because ours might not cover the same functions that the leading brands do , it might be a good idea to market it as a um finder function . <EOS>
at which you need something to happen . <EOS> so you make a schematic of the way that the the energy is converted tsh towards this practical function . <EOS> and then i think the easiest thing to do is gonna be work on each task separately . <EOS> so um <EOS> uh . uh . <EOS>
well , <EOS> one thing i'm aware of is , th there uh um at the sort of v very high price end of the market there's there's a em emerging market for sort of touch screen l_c_d_ remotes <EOS> that can be uh programmed in m much more sophisticated ways than sort of conventional models , <EOS> so you get the sort of you get um you <EOS> you can redesign the interface to your own needs , <EOS> you can programme in macros , <EOS> and you get a much greater degree <EOS> um um i mean you get in these sort of three in one , five in one , whatevers , <EOS> but you can get integration between the different uh the the the diff the different things that it's designed to control , to a much greater extent , <EOS> and you can have one uh you know one macro to turn the uh you know turn the t_v_ to the right channel , get the uh re uh rewind the tape in the v_c_r_ and get it to play once it's rewound , for instance . <EOS> um b it occurs to me there might be a niche for uh for a remote that aimed towards some of that sort of functionality but using a just conventional push button design . <EOS> and therefore putting it into a um well much lower price bracket . <EOS>
alright ? <EOS> alright . <EOS> thank you for coming to this third meeting of the uh uh design group . <EOS> um i think we uh made some definite progress at the last one <EOS> um and come up with some interesting uh uh w suggestions for our our new remote control . <EOS> um i'll again very quickly uh just present some notes of that meeting . <EOS> um the the the problem with existing remote controls , we felt , was that they're ugly <EOS> um and that people are prepared to pay a premium for something better . <EOS> um they've got lots of buttons on them <EOS> that uh people don't use <EOS> and find difficult to learn . <EOS> um and people lose them . <EOS> and we we thought that f for our our new uh uh remote control that everybody will want to rush out and buy , <EOS> um that we're we should look at speech recognition rather than r rather than buttons , <EOS> and that if we have any buttons they should be very few of them and only for those functions that are actually identified that that people use . <EOS> that <EOS> um we want to go for uh a long lasting battery <EOS> that we gua we guarantee for the life of the uh uh the product <EOS> and a shape that will be instantly recognisable , a_ um as uh a trendy remote control , and and b_ as uh a real reaction product . <EOS> so that w uh when people are uh happy with that , they will they will want to buy uh everything else from us . uh <EOS> okay . so <EOS> again um , i'll we'll have the three three presentations from the the the three of you <EOS> and then uh we'll we'll make a a final a final uh decision . <EOS> um and the the decisions that we need to to make today , finally , are um what energy source we want to use , <EOS> whether i it is practical to use uh um a a a long lasting one . <EOS> and uh i i think our discussion was around the fact that uh if we're gonna go for uh a long lasting power supply , then basically it's uh sealed for life <EOS> and uh if anybody does manage to run one down , we'll we'll give them another one . <EOS> and uh it it'll be uh , you know , prominently displayed as part of the th the advertising literature <EOS> that it's um um , you know , for life , guaranteed for life . <EOS> um now the the the internal chip <EOS> um and uh this is where i need uh uh kate's expert advice <EOS> and given that th this has to to go to market as quickly as possible <EOS> um d d do we go for a custom designed chip ? <EOS> or or do we buy one off the shelf and and programme it ourselves ? <EOS> uh i mean <EOS> i'm i'm i'm <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> um so that was the last meeting . <EOS> is there anything have i forgotten anything ? <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> no . <EOS> uh that sounds . <EOS> is that everything ? <EOS> okay . <EOS> um so if we have the three presentations , <EOS> and then if you have anything to kind of that you know you're gonna want to discuss , maybe just make a note of it , and we'll have all the discussion at the end . <EOS> that might be a better idea this time . <EOS> and so if we start off uh with andrew and then craig and then david , <EOS> if that's alright . <EOS> um and then after that we'll have to make some decisions about stuff , right . <EOS> so if you wanna take this . <EOS>
well , wait a second , <EOS> no , it's it's double curved , <EOS> it's got a c , it's uh <EOS> because we have two things . <EOS> oh it's got all the directions <EOS> so don't worry . <EOS> no . <EOS> well d yeah it's monotonic but <EOS>
okay . <EOS> then press uh al <EOS> okay . <EOS> this . <EOS> you know ? <EOS> i don't know . <EOS> just try . <EOS> 'kay . <EOS> on this normal <EOS> oh oh . <EOS> alt f_ five . <EOS> good . <EOS> doesn't appear on the screen here . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> whereby we had the design logo was one , which we've already mentioned . <EOS> we've got um the remote was only for the television <EOS> and not for <EOS> because that would make it too complex <EOS> and we have to get it market quickly . <EOS> and the uh third thing was that um teletext uh as far as uh the management is concerned , um is becoming dated uh due to the popularity of the internet . <EOS>
now that's i just have a q a q question for you . <EOS> this w um research that you've been doing looki looking at other , you know , existing units stuff . <EOS> um have you found that anyone else has do has looked into the locking function or <EOS>
no . <EOS> i think that would be the case in the sixteen to forty five age category . <EOS> because they are critical <EOS> and they they want to have a fancy remote control . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> people of forty plus , i mean they want it to work , <EOS> but as soo as soon as it works it's okay with them . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> okay , well <EOS> that should <EOS> it has to be remote control , <EOS> not <EOS> yeah , <EOS> twelve . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> but they want to talk into the remo remote control , or something , <EOS> or ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> is this only would you <EOS> would you pay more for speech recognition in a remote control . it's the only thing it says . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> oh . <EOS> that's good to remember . <EOS> so <EOS> i think you can take minutes again . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> that's nice , i think . <EOS> so <EOS> we've we want different functions <EOS> since it's your job . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> uh and we can maybe see if we can do something with the infra-red . <EOS> but i don't know if that will exceed the production costs . <EOS> so that uh that's something we have to find out , i think . <EOS>
uh <EOS> so , my mush . <EOS> looks like more fruit . <EOS> maybe a pineapple ? <EOS> yeah , but you don't have any button now . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i dunno . <EOS> and you know , you have the finger here , with the buttons ? <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah , i kn i mean i know what you're saying about the fifteen to twenty five year olds , <EOS> but i mean it has been proven that that people of that age group have a higher disposable income <EOS> because they don't have like i mean , you know , if you're at university , you're paying your rent , <EOS> but you don't have a mortgage , <EOS> you don't have a life insurance policy , <EOS>
it should be possible yes . if it's not too fancy . <EOS> and if the remote stays rather small , it should be possible <EOS> yeah . <EOS> 'cause it can be <EOS> no . <EOS> no . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> because i think that's uh <EOS> no . <EOS>
yeah , yeah . <EOS> do you think they'd notice if one went ? <EOS> i don't think you should say that was the recording . <EOS> okay , cover up the microphone . <EOS> alright , let's take it . <EOS> okay . <EOS> oh okay . <EOS> yep . shh . <EOS> yep . <EOS> but that worked well having having a whiteboard that we could draw on as well as having the powerpoint , <EOS> 'cause the i find that the problem with powerpoint often is that it's so static <EOS> and you can't change it once you're in there , <EOS> yep . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> mm . <EOS> based on what nathan presented as far as the um various costs and benefits um i think , i dunno , what do you guys think about the touch screen at this point ? <EOS> i think it's our most marketable feature <EOS> just because it's so new <EOS> and it's something that is showing up in other places . <EOS>
yeah it wouldn't be a problem . <EOS> but i was just wondering <EOS> like as long as we realise that's what it'll do . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> but i suppose it's not as snappy . <EOS> well the there is a there's a delay on remotes i think . <EOS> where you can have it <EOS> it's like a five second input time . <EOS> so as long as you hit them dada <EOS>
separate . <EOS> a a <EOS> a normal button on the remote control , <EOS> or norm ? <EOS> yeah , yeah . <EOS> to turn it on . <EOS> of <EOS> or you should put it in the l_c_d_ screen . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> because uh when you touch the l_c_d_ screen when it is in standby mode , it should pop on . <EOS>
or function f_ eight ? <EOS> okay . <EOS> oh you need to twiddle the thingamibobsy thing . <EOS> okay . i think it's uh just to lock it in . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> it's got it . <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> um . <EOS> so as the industrial designer my job is to take an input from you guys , <EOS> um so it's good you went first , <EOS> and i jotted down some notes as to what are the b needs and uh what kind of novel features we can add to differentiate our product from the others . <EOS>
'cause <EOS> shock proof . <EOS> my remote control tends to fall a lot . <EOS> waterproof , <EOS> or uh <EOS> sure . <EOS> so <EOS> uh , you never no know uh , <EOS> i w i mean uh <EOS> waterproof . <EOS> okay . so <EOS> these are our um a few things we can think of . <EOS>
the material used is spongy , <EOS> that that's uh that's a one , <EOS> that's m rubber . <EOS> what ? <EOS> what spongy . <EOS> yeah , yeah , it's very spongy . <EOS> oh <EOS> but not it's not very spongy , <EOS> because it's hard rubber . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> h i think i think that the tr the transition to this to this new remote control shouldn't be very very abrupt very hard <EOS> because w if people see a remo see the see a remote control without numbers mm they will think it's very difficult to learn very difficult to very different build very different to the traditional <EOS>
two . <EOS> good morning . <EOS> hello . hello . <EOS> hello . <EOS> ah . <EOS> you have to put it exactly on the on the <EOS> yeah . <EOS> plate ? <EOS> okay . <EOS> good morning . <EOS> good morning . <EOS> i took your mouse . <EOS> yeah <EOS> just <EOS> yeah , <EOS> no , <EOS> that's for me , <EOS> i just have to make some notes . <EOS> i got my uh mouse . <EOS>
seven to ten banana . <EOS> a big banana . <EOS> okay . <EOS> rather mango or something or . <EOS> um . <EOS> well it's it's definitely the obvious choice , with the colour of our company . <EOS> i mean what other what other fruit and vegetables <EOS> do you know of any any other fruit and vegetables that are yellow ? <EOS>
maybe if the remote control is something that y you don't actually have to pick up anymore , that would be a a useful feature of the speech recogntion . <EOS> if you can leave it sitting on the table and you don't actually have to find it , then that could be . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> um and that impacts cost . <EOS> um i don't think the logic chip has a issue about size 'cause they should be about the same size . <EOS> power consumption should be about the same . <EOS> um i think the main impact is complexity , <EOS> um and the other thing is um the power options . <EOS> um the first one is a standard battery . <EOS> okay the second one i think is more of a gimmick then actually a useable thing , <EOS> it's a wind-up you know , a crank . <EOS> yeah <EOS> but that that might be something <EOS> i think that's more of a look and feel decision because i don't think you can have one power source if you're using the alternative power sources . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i also have uh copied a different type of remote . <EOS> if you can find me , where i'm at . <EOS> there should only be one in here . <EOS> trend watch . <EOS> sure . <EOS> it's being modified . <EOS> they're stealing our product . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> okay . <EOS> are there any questions for clarification of maarika before we go on to the next one ? <EOS> so in the u user interface requirements uh uh uh we we have been able to identify what are the basic buttons that we do want . <EOS> um but um <EOS> so so at this stage , uh how we go about implementing those button we will not identify <EOS> or i mean in we can completely do away with buttons <EOS> and uh have some kind of a fancy user interface or something like that . <EOS> but uh is is there any uh uh any thoughts on that ? <EOS>
if you have the l_c_d_ , <EOS> but if n <EOS> l_c_d_ ? <EOS> then uh there is no meaning in having it on the t_v_ . <EOS> or then again you have a channels , volume and all the stuff and what a <EOS> yeah . <EOS> but you cannot display all on a l_c_d_ . <EOS>
and so um an elder designer picks up th the of <EOS> an elder parents or grandparent picks up the remote from the little child and who's all in the systems functions , you'll have to have the possibility to turn off the t_v_ or to switch the channel without um well using all the menu structures to get back to the primary functions . <EOS>
no . <EOS> it's actually shut down . <EOS> no ? <EOS> it's on , but there's nothing on the screen . <EOS> okay , um now what we have <EOS> uh our next meeting's in half an hour <EOS> and what i would like you guys to do is work on giving me a model in clay . <EOS>
and this is something that came on down from from the higher ups , <EOS> so , i mean , we are sort of beholden to them . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so we have to have it one colour . <EOS> well , not necessarily . but we have to incorporate it . <EOS>
okay , <EOS> then we we use m must use the second most expensive chip . so th so the regular chip . <EOS> because we use scroll wheels . <EOS> yeah , okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> and um yeah , <EOS> that was it i guess . <EOS> uh are are we using a a rubber case , <EOS> or <EOS> we haven't decided yet . <EOS>
mm well <EOS> i think fi five min <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> forty minutes ? yeah so you you you can have uh keys like uh which are which are like so . <EOS> too sorry , <EOS> so we basically don't change the uh original order of them <EOS> but then the keys are more spacious , <EOS> they don't look uh so there there is a very sligh thing , <EOS> so if you press on the top it takes the one , it takes the three , uh four , sorry four here uh five and six , <EOS> so the keys can be it looks you know not very much cluttered <EOS> but it looks nice <EOS> for you don't have too many keys <EOS> but you can have a lot of options t if you press on the to <EOS>
well i guess , you know , apple has the ipod so , <EOS> imagi <EOS> just 'cause they have an apple on their <EOS> on their product , doesn't mean fruit is cool . <EOS> no i think we we should think about a a shape with it <EOS> a device with a shape of some <EOS>
um the way we hope to achieve that is uh the following methods . <EOS> it consists of three phases , namely the functional design , conceptual design and detailed design . <EOS> as you can see , all of these phases consists of two parts , namely individual work part and a meeting <EOS> where we will discuss uh our work so far . <EOS>
this one is uh , i suppose for the younger audiences . <EOS> okay <EOS> , so so barney the banana . <EOS> a a more friendly type of <EOS> right , right . <EOS> it's to uh induce more television watching i suppose or <EOS> ah excellent , just what we need . <EOS>
a wind-up . <EOS> alright . <EOS> remember , <EOS> we only have forty minutes <EOS> mm . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> now <EOS> i'm afraid this is the options we've got on on the case . <EOS> it can be made of plastic , rubber , wood o if you like , or titanium . <EOS> um and the nearest we've got to st to spongy there i guess is rubber , <EOS>
i have been told that we uh don't consider teletext , <EOS> that it's out of date now because of internet . <EOS> i can tell you that uh in a l in a scale between one and ten relevant uh not relevant to relevant people scored a six on this , <EOS> which is not as uh these <EOS> these two one were had i think ten i think . <EOS>
mm . yeah , definitely . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yep . <EOS> uh a new approach . <EOS> um are the costs within budget ? <EOS> yes . <EOS> is the project evaluated ? <EOS> we're we're all happy that it it meets all the criteria , um <EOS>
uh okay , can can i at this point interject um something ? <EOS> um we have received instruction from higher up that certain things should not be uh considered . <EOS> um the one thing for example something to eliminate maybe that's the teletext , <EOS> because that's sort of outdated with the internet , <EOS> and according to to higher management the it should only control the t_v_ , <EOS> mostly because they feel that it's too comp complex a task to um to to include other things , <EOS> and they are concerned with the time to market . <EOS>
okay . uh <EOS> good afternoon . <EOS> this is our third meeting already . <EOS> i hope you enjoyed your lunch . <EOS> i did anyway . <EOS> um let's see . <EOS> good afternoon . <EOS> presentation three . <EOS> okay <EOS> this is um the second phase uh we're going to discuss today . <EOS> it's the conceptual design meeting . <EOS> and a few points of interest in this meeting um are the conceptual specification of components . uh conceptual specification of design . and also trend-watching . <EOS> um these are hopefully the points you addressed in uh your pre uh presentations <EOS> you're going to show me in a few minutes . <EOS> um but first i'll show you the agenda . <EOS> uh first the opening . <EOS> then we have three presentations . <EOS> uh after that we have to come to a decision on remote control concepts . <EOS> how we're going to make it . <EOS> and then we're closing . <EOS> we have about forty minutes . <EOS> uh so i suggest let's get started . <EOS> uh did someone encounter any problems during the preparation ? <EOS> no ? <EOS> everything fine ? <EOS> that's nice . <EOS>
yes the the the there are changeable covers , <EOS> but on the other hand i i don't know whether my superiors would be so glad with it <EOS> because you have to introduce a complete uh uh new l line of uh of supplies <EOS> uh it would be uh very complicated uh organisational <EOS>
mm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> could have one for your stereo , one for your d_v_ player . <EOS> mm , yeah , yeah . <EOS> have to <EOS> if we just lengthen it i guess <EOS> so it comes down to the base of the hand <EOS> and then flatten it out <EOS> and could sit there . <EOS>
yeah . yeah . <EOS> oh no , i mean um like there's kind of individual buttons for them , like on the t_v_ remote . <EOS> but i don't really know what they're for , <EOS> i've never used them . <EOS> i just know they're something to do with dolby . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> right . <EOS> um well this is the kick-off meeting for our our project . <EOS> um and um <EOS> this is just what we're gonna be doing over the next twenty five minutes . <EOS> um so first of all , just to kind of make sure that we all know each other , <EOS> i'm laura and i'm the project manager . <EOS> do you want to introduce yourself again ? <EOS>
yeah , <EOS> you can choose the code . <EOS> okay . okay . okay . okay , <EOS> but uh i think that most people uh th uh will buy the remote control because <EOS> because uh the first they lost the one they lost first one <EOS> or the first one is broken , <EOS> so uh uh perhaps they have a got a an older television , <EOS> so that option is not uh optional for those uh people . <EOS>
yeah , i agree . <EOS> it's better like that , <EOS> isn't it ? <EOS> most <EOS> okay . <EOS> l last one w i would like to judge is <EOS> is it easy to use ? <EOS> eh , for th the vocal command yes , it's might be easy . <EOS> but it's just speaking . <EOS> you just need the command . <EOS>
did anyone ? <EOS> no . <EOS> oh well . <EOS> um i'll try and do that for the next meeting as well <EOS> so if you check in there , there's a shared project documents folder . um and it should be in there . <EOS> no . <EOS> mm . <EOS>
right . <EOS> yes . <EOS> 'kay . <EOS> i'll wait . <EOS> yeah , she's got it . <EOS> it's good . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay so , we're using the criteria uh for a seven point scale , <EOS> and so we need to discuss how we feel . it falls within this range , <EOS> so for easy to use , <EOS>
oh i see . oh yeah , i see . <EOS> b_b_c_ one . <EOS> um okay , <EOS> i mean you could print actually print it on the uh <EOS> mm-hmm , yeah . <EOS> device itself . um . <EOS> i mean i'm just thinking of the point of view of peop you could still like lose this remote . <EOS>
quite poss yeah . <EOS> well this is all your department . <EOS> mm okay . <EOS> well , well done everybody . <EOS> and um , i think we uh stop for lunch now . <EOS> . <EOS> yeah , pretty soon i think , <EOS> i guess that's now . <EOS>
yes . <EOS> i mean working remotes we already have . <EOS> this will be something different from the other remotes remote controls . <EOS> yeah , i dunno i <EOS> what we we have to keep in mind the these characteristics . <EOS> and of course it should not be very costly . <EOS>
so maybe a three or a four . <EOS> uh yeah , <EOS> actually in fact i think it will be <EOS> yeah <EOS> one me um we hope <EOS> maybe sometimes people get uh scared with the number of buttons . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah <EOS> but y <EOS>
i think technically it's acceptable , so <EOS> maybe two ? <EOS> so using the same scale , two ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> two ? <EOS> i would say two <EOS> . you agree ? <EOS> two , yeah , two . it's it's fine , so . <EOS> okay . <EOS> now maybe the most critical one . <EOS>
yeah . yeah . <EOS> yes <EOS> maybe more trendy . <EOS> but you you you you think about uh uh one you can fold open . <EOS> okay , <EOS> yeah , that's cool . <EOS> maybe for the d_v_d_ pla player or something , <EOS> if you just <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> i think that will be a problem because we don't have an input device to get the listings into it , <EOS> so um it's a bit nuts to get the monday tuesday wednesday you know . <EOS> right , okay . <EOS> mm oh yeah that's true . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so so no need for an l_c_d_ display ? <EOS>
mm . <EOS> oh the customers , okay . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> think that's that's important matter . <EOS> that's the big question <EOS> yeah . <EOS> uh . so <EOS> and then uh we will close this meeting uh <EOS> and after this meeting we'll uh we'll have a lunch . <EOS> good . <EOS>
you can manage all this , yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> good . <EOS> so <EOS> you have questions ? <EOS> um . not really . <EOS> so <EOS> you all know what the parts of the work you have to do . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so <EOS> which <EOS> you , the industrial designer . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> probably . <EOS> right . <EOS> i think to a certain extent we have to stick with uh kind of uh a little bit traditional in terms of the buttons <EOS> and then and then make our unique feature our casing and what not and our voice command . <EOS>
wow . <EOS> 'kay . <EOS> looks pretty complicated . <EOS> right , okay . <EOS> mm-hmm , like the middle button . <EOS> okay . <EOS> ah it's kinda like scrolling <EOS> uh right , well , <EOS> if i s if i'm thinking of the right one , i've got the same thing in front of my monitor , <EOS> you scroll it and the when you reach the sort of um menu item that you require , you press the middle of the scroll . <EOS> right , okay . <EOS>
no ? <EOS> yeah , it is connected . <EOS> it's connected ? <EOS> yeah , i think so . <EOS> to room . <EOS> deskt huh . no . <EOS> i'll just uh saved in my documents . <EOS> oh . <EOS> yeah <EOS> in my own uh in my own messenger . <EOS>
so is that , when you say speaker support , you mean it just has some output pinned which which which kind of <EOS> it could be a beep kind of thing . <EOS> okay , <EOS> but the speaker is actually attached to the to the chip in some way , or is just the the signal ? <EOS> okay . <EOS>
mm . course not . <EOS> there you go . <EOS> cool , <EOS> um . okay . um . <EOS> well this is just the working design um . <EOS> well this is just what how i would go about it . <EOS> um i guess i try to define like what we're doing now , <EOS> try to define what we're trying to get done . <EOS> um i think in a practical way , we kind of know what it is . <EOS> we've used it , <EOS> we're familiar with it , <EOS> but we're we can't n we haven't narrowed down um exactly what the things we're trying to fulfil , like <EOS> besides the basics , <EOS> i think back in the back of our minds we know what the basics are . <EOS> has to change channels , has to change volume , <EOS> but in like specifics , right , which one of the basics are you trying to target . <EOS> um are there certain parts of the basics that are more important or less important than the basics ? <EOS> um and i just <EOS> the idea is just to get everybody to um <EOS> i usually have a have have a design that's there as a basic , <EOS> so , you know , things that to start everything going . <EOS> but i guess everybody does have some idea , <EOS> so i don't think um there's a need for that . <EOS>
yeah yeah , <EOS> it's a real pen . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> but it's just a picture . <EOS> oh . <EOS> you really <EOS> y you can you can't edit in the edit it in word . <EOS> no . <EOS> no . <EOS> oh , okay . <EOS>
hmm . <EOS> there's only like three chairs . <EOS> that's like saying you're never gonna lose your keys , <EOS> and i always do , anyway . <EOS> you'll lose 'em in your pocket , <EOS> like <EOS> you just will forget that <EOS> or you like put it down somewhere that like made sense and then not remember , <EOS> there's always ways to lose things . <EOS>
maybe we can <EOS> we can always improve , yes . <EOS> yeah , include some more buttons and uh um <EOS> yeah features . <EOS> we can make the buttons few buttons smaller . <EOS> uh i think they are quite big , <EOS> so i think i i mean we can just have small buttons and more buttons in that case . if we want to have more features than that . <EOS>
yeah , i dunno . yeah . <EOS> maybe . but anyways uh it should be transparent . <EOS> we decided that , <EOS> huh ? <EOS> s <EOS> well <EOS> one of the options . <EOS> you can <EOS> just like a mobile phone , you can make um different fronts on it . <EOS> so you can just replace them i think . <EOS>
this looks more like it . <EOS> i think i just opened up the template . <EOS> sorry about that . <EOS> okay alright so let's have a look here . <EOS> okay so this was the method that um i've taken . <EOS> uh basically what i wanna do here , before we get into it uh too far , is i want to show you all the background information i have that i think we need to acknowledge if we want this to be successful . <EOS>
yeah , okay . <EOS> unless anyone has any questions about that ? <EOS> not yet ? <EOS> 'kay . <EOS> i don't think so , not yet . um , yes , thank you . <EOS> that screwed in ? <EOS> okay . <EOS> i hate those little things <EOS>
yeah . yeah , <EOS> it's much more complex , <EOS> but <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so , <EOS> i think , we can summarise . <EOS> so <EOS> we have seen the prototype . <EOS> it's very nice according to the work of our two designer . <EOS> the the the financial aspect were okay . <EOS> we we have the cost below uh our threshold <EOS> and so we could sell at twenty five euros <EOS> and make i make profit . <EOS>
okay , <EOS> i i <EOS> my only comment is i think maybe um we could somehow include an enter key in like a power key if power power was enter and pow that was my only just really in terms of streamlining . <EOS> ah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> okay . <EOS>
so <EOS> and <EOS> okay now , <EOS> m maybe not . <EOS> if i don't do it , maybe old people <EOS> no , <EOS> maybe elderly people uh . <EOS> right . <EOS> they don't like new features . <EOS> so maybe not . <EOS> yeah , i dunno . <EOS>
okay , yeah . <EOS> mm . <EOS> but you're gonna need some type of flash memory or something . <EOS> well <EOS> something that doesn't <EOS> you wouldn't have to redo the whole thing once the batteries are changed , you know , once you turn off the power . <EOS>
in fact we already have this for a coffee maker line <EOS> mm . <EOS> lot of single people on the um on the re on the remote control research team <EOS> at the <EOS> on the remote control <EOS> right . <EOS> yeah . very true , very true . <EOS>
yeah . he is a big guy . yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> good call . <EOS> okay so <EOS> it really works just like a pen <EOS> only makes noises i think . <EOS> it's kinda weird . <EOS> anyway <EOS> yeah . yeah , <EOS> you're like press and it's . <EOS> kinda cool . <EOS> you'll see . <EOS> alright so um <EOS> whoever wants to get up next , you can write down some telly that you watch or whatever you want . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> i coulda told you a whole lot more about beagles . <EOS> boy , let me tell you . <EOS> ach why not <EOS> we might have to get you up again then . <EOS> i don't know what mine is . <EOS> i'm gonna have to think on the spot now . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> okay . <EOS> we will give the rating to this product based on the user requirements , whether it meets the user requirements or not , this product . <EOS> then trends , whether it is as fashion trends or not ? <EOS> means because we have already stated that people do prefer fashionable things nowadays . <EOS> so this is also an important factor for our evaluation also . <EOS> then marketing strategy of the company . <EOS> as we have already discussed that our company is quite in the market , <EOS> not only in terms of providing quality products , not only in pro providing latest technologies , but also in terms of providing environmental s <EOS>
this is what we came up with . <EOS> it's a pretty simple design . <EOS> it's um based on a mango ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> and we <EOS> yeah , here we are . <EOS> mango shape . <EOS> on ? <EOS> a mango . <EOS> okay . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay , <EOS> i'll ask um uh maggie and pierrette uh if they have uh any preferences . <EOS> um . <EOS> oh , great . <EOS> that would be great . <EOS> that would be great . <EOS> mm-hmm . perfect . <EOS> c that that of course is one of the main well not main but one of the important features that we need to know about . <EOS>
yeah mm mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> so <EOS> my personal design <EOS> we need to find a solution what um what is the material of the cover we want to use . <EOS> if it's plastic <EOS> or you said that yeah you had some ideas uh like fruit , veg or <EOS> i dunno . <EOS> yes . <EOS>
so the the top bit's the power source , yes ? . <EOS> ah yes , that's the power source . <EOS> um . <EOS> going on to personal preferences , i've said that battery seems the best option for the actual remote , <EOS> just because of the size . <EOS> you don't want a a cable attached to the remote otherwise it's not it's not really a remote . <EOS> um and then the sender , <EOS> and infra-red um has been used quite successfully . <EOS> if the battery's on reasonable power , they always seem to work fairly well . <EOS> you don't have to be point directly at the television itself . <EOS> um <EOS>
yeah , i think so . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> we can b <EOS> but th yeah , that can be very simple . least . <EOS> it c it could be just just a square , just a packet . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> just a recharger . <EOS>
yeah , okay , <EOS> three . point three . <EOS> if we use the uh <EOS> but m yeah , course , <EOS> but <EOS> what we'll have . <EOS> let's make it thirteen or fourteen . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> we we scrap that one ? <EOS> huh ? <EOS> point twelve . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> let's give it a two . <EOS> is it innovative ? <EOS> i think it is , <EOS> because it has an l_c_d_ screen , a mi microphone . <EOS> enough . <EOS> yeah <EOS> m <EOS> and uh uh the scroll is rubber , <EOS> so s <EOS>
okay . <EOS> is it technologically innovative ? <EOS> oh sorry i'm taking over your job here . <EOS> go right ahead . <EOS> oh no , it's fine , <EOS> you're i mean you're project manager . <EOS> um yeah , i mean and it <EOS> does it have voice i mean the phrase recognition on it ? <EOS>
mm . <EOS> so i reckon it'd look quite nice if we just had um this here , had a sorta background yellow , <EOS> and then have sort of a nice bold colour for the buttons . <EOS> uh-huh . <EOS> okay cool . <EOS> um and also i mean how are we going to incorporate the slogan in ? <EOS> the fact that it talks to you , i mean it might be quite cool if when you first start using it it says , what is it , putting fashion into electronics or something , <EOS> i dunno . <EOS> or when you like <EOS> or if you turn it off or something if it can speak if it could actually say the slogan it might be a bit more powerful than just having it written on it somewhere . <EOS> i d i d any thoughts on that at all ? <EOS>
oh yeah , i think so . yeah . <EOS> uh just twos . one three and a few ones . <EOS> that was your evaluation uh show , <EOS> okay , so <EOS> we don't have to calculate anything because of um these results . <EOS> okay , good . <EOS> um let's see <EOS> oh , <EOS> it isn't asked to save <EOS> but it did already <EOS>
uh , you wanna be able to change angles in interactive television , <EOS> so you need buttons to change the television angle , the camera angles and stuff like that . <EOS> 'kay . <EOS> has anybody got anything they'd like to add at this stage , anything they think that might have been missed so far ? <EOS>
okay , well <EOS> it's time uh for some discussion . <EOS> i've wrote down some examples here of what we can can speak about . <EOS> uh what's your experience with remote controls , <EOS> um what kind of ideas do you have to design a new remote control , <EOS> maybe for which market segments should we aim , <EOS> or should we aim for all segments . <EOS> uh well <EOS> actually i'd like to hand the word uh back to you . <EOS>
yeah , <EOS> and then you <EOS> okay , yeah . <EOS> and also it's <EOS> but you have to make a sound device in it then . <EOS> yeah , there must be sound in it . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> but <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay , <EOS> it shouldn't take much <EOS>
uh <EOS> you you just said um uh you wanted to to combine more functions in one , <EOS> so uh <EOS> you you want to keep it simple , <EOS> but i think that if you want to do that , then you can't escape the the fact that there will be buttons uh which give s uh more options than one . <EOS>
sorry , <EOS> this is i'm just um <EOS> . <EOS> there we go and there are the marks . <EOS> beautiful . <EOS> not anymore . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> computer no signal ? <EOS> mm i guess it'll have to wait for a bit . <EOS> adjusting . <EOS> there we go . <EOS> okay , <EOS> so we've looked at the prototype presentation and the evaluation criteria . <EOS> and now we have to calculate the production costs . <EOS> so i've got an excel spreadsheet to help us do that . <EOS> can you read that ? <EOS> almost . <EOS>
rabbit . <EOS> that's it . <EOS> you want to go ? <EOS> i am not very good at uh this kind of stuff . <EOS> my favourite animal is <EOS> hmm . <EOS> you wa <EOS> wow . <EOS> a human <EOS> ah . <EOS> guess . <EOS> a human , yay . <EOS> it's a very complex animal <EOS> and um yeah . <EOS> characteristics of this this animal is dangerous . <EOS>
yeah , <EOS> th th those things are nice . <EOS> partial . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> but but if you display it on l_c_d_ screen with r r really big numbers <EOS> yeah , <EOS> you can de display it on the on the old style . <EOS> you can display actual buttons on the touch screens . <EOS>
yeah , <EOS> that's <EOS> then the the one thing we want to know is like <EOS> because remote control is used for like in the household <EOS> so it it it will be it m maybe at least five , six people want to use it <EOS> so so how to uh uh how to define our re speech recognition <EOS> whether we want to do s speaker independent or speaker dependent . <EOS> if we're going for more speaker independent then it would be like again cumbersome <EOS> and we need really m more technology <EOS> and so <EOS>
so <EOS> yeah , <EOS> just give it a one . it's okay . <EOS> it's perfect . <EOS> i think it's just what you want . <EOS> or not ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> it's hard to decide for us , but yeah . <EOS> yeah . it's ju so subjective . <EOS>
yeah . one . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> th <EOS> the plus number thing . <EOS> yeah that's the only thing yeah . <EOS> yeah and perhaps the turning on <EOS> but <EOS> number four . <EOS> is this a good-looking remote ? <EOS> remember that seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> so what can you ? <EOS> he he he <EOS> you did work together didn't you ? <EOS> yeah we will yeah , <EOS> so i will be able to to summarize uh our meeting , <EOS> but still i think uh it would be in very important if the uh as um main designer .
i think it does . <EOS> i think it's , well , if the r_r_ motto is , we bring fashion to to electronics , i'd say that could be quite fashionable . <EOS> fashion to electronics . yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> and it's got the b the black and yellow and blue . <EOS> plus red , which is sort of a a fruit and vegetable uh uh . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> can be moved around all nice . <EOS> um okay <EOS> on to on to the next uh to the next slide . <EOS> okay . <EOS> um , yeah . <EOS> just to let you know we'll probably be quite tight for time as well , <EOS> because i think you've probably got a lot you'd like to say , i guess . <EOS>
wait . and that meaning what ? <EOS> like <EOS> they like i guess use the buttons a lot . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> i don't know . <EOS> it's from my uh research . <EOS> right . <EOS> okay , what do you m <EOS> oh , i'm sorry . <EOS> what do you mean by um the current remote controls do not match well with the operating behaviour of the user , like they have to press the buttons . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> any ideas on that ? <EOS> i mean i know the ipods and things right now have touch scroll um buttons <EOS> which are exactly like what they're describing , <EOS> so that might be something we wanna look into . <EOS> and i'm really intrigued by the idea of a kinetic battery . <EOS> solar i don't think would be such a good idea , <EOS> because how often are you sure that your remote control will get a certain amount of light . <EOS> but this idea of the kinetic , that you don't have to replace , <EOS> and that a simple just shaking it around will make it work , <EOS> i think that that m would be a very interesting thing . <EOS> but i think we'd also wanna go for e a simple chip or regular chip <EOS> to keep our costs down . <EOS> uh we really only need a regular or advanced chip t if we're gonna start using an l_c_d_ . <EOS> so i think we want to be aware of not making things overly t <EOS>
mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> there you go . <EOS> rather than rather th <EOS> it could <EOS> and then you could actually h put the banana-shaped thing on the fruit bowl , on the coffee table , <EOS> and then people would always know where it was . <EOS>
one , t seven , eight , oh . fourth . <EOS> okay , so <EOS> we have to go through each point . <EOS> if we imagine it's actually straight , <EOS> and just give it a a score . <EOS> so um <EOS> how well would you say the prototype is <EOS> uh how well have we realised the dream of being able to stop remotes from from being lost , or to be able to find them once they are lost . <EOS> i mean , uh is the homing thing still the locator , is that still <EOS>
that's right . <EOS> okay . yeah . <EOS> so these these were the component selection and these things . <EOS> we can go to the next slide . <EOS> and uh these were the findings which i i saw with the web web , <EOS> that user wants to have control more than one device wants to control more than one device from the same remote control , <EOS> so our t_v_ remote can have little extra things to support additional devices like v_c_r_ d_v_d_ players which are usually attached with the t_v_ , <EOS> because users are like this and they don't want to have one remote control for everything , <EOS> so with this additional little , we might be having slightly better market for us . <EOS>
oh , thank you . <EOS> mm . <EOS> cool . <EOS> see you soon . <EOS> does it matter that i end early ? <EOS> i it's strange because <EOS> how how early is it ? <EOS> i didn't get a pop-up thing that said <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> y you could add an extra feature actually . <EOS> which makes this thing raise hell when you remove it too far from the television . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> we could add that but that's nothing we have thought of so far . <EOS> which , which may be cheaper than speech recognition if it were just a <EOS>
mm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> okay and if there is th the conclusion now . <EOS> so as we say before , i think uh um a remote control lightening in the dark it's it's a good thing . <EOS> uh not to many mud buttons like we we said before , <EOS> e easy to use uh a way to find it easily in the room and uh uh resistant to to shock <EOS> and to to <EOS>
okay , so <EOS> now we are on the conceptual design meeting . <EOS> uh y getting close to the last <EOS> is the penultim meeting . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> how was lunch ? <EOS> thanks <EOS> don't be sarcastic . mark . <EOS> mm great . <EOS> so um <EOS> i will again do the secretary part <EOS> uh we will have three presentation first um uh the industrial design , first rama then mark and then sammy . <EOS> um um we have to take a decision on the control remote control concepts <EOS> and we have forty minutes . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> so we should first decide about shape , i think . <EOS> which uh <EOS> then you can fit the l_c_d_ screen in it , <EOS> and can decide uh . <EOS> ding ding . <EOS> yeah i think that's the better thing to do . <EOS> um i also s uh can't help but notice that you uh used an you had a remote control <EOS> and the l_c_d_ screen was uh rather small . um . <EOS>
uh-huh . <EOS> there's a lot of online that's that is doing this now . <EOS> yes . <EOS> and when you're rotating , you'll look behind and look this way uh <EOS> it's possible to do with this , <EOS> maybe there's a possibility of selling more than two million units in one year , which could you know , feasibili feasibility uh lower the price of the unit . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> that's true . <EOS> and the spaceship doesn't have the r_ have a massive r_ and r_ down the side of it <EOS> but i still want one . <EOS> no . <EOS> doesn't <EOS> mm . <EOS> okay . um i've just had a sign flashing up saying , finish the meeting . <EOS>
ooh it works . <EOS> whoo . <EOS> spicy . <EOS> spicy . <EOS> where are are all the other presentations ? <EOS> i just put it in the in the shared folder so it should be <EOS> yeah i think so . yeah , conceptual design . <EOS> what or whatever does it <EOS>
or that you can put 'em on uh on on wide and <EOS> yeah . <EOS> but that should also be a sub then , a sub uh menu thing . <EOS> menu . <EOS> yeah <EOS> it should be available , but then in separate screen settings or something . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> yep . okay . <EOS> w <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i think , making it out of a nice material would be very important , <EOS> because so many of those remotes that you see , these universal remotes look so cheap and low quality . <EOS>
uh no no no no , <EOS> i think uh we have uh to to uh have uh embedded uh b batteries in in the <EOS> yeah into the t . <EOS> yeah , yeah . <EOS> and uh i i don't think it will need um very uh much power to make it run , so <EOS>
mm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> and of course most of the people are interested in if it's less expensive , <EOS> so this is an important criteria here is <EOS> mm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> but <EOS> but do you think what they sug suggested s possibility . <EOS>
right . <EOS> didn't you mention the teletext , just television only ? <EOS> oh yeah <EOS> well <EOS> th that's one i s that's one i sent you , <EOS> which which was my interpretation of uh of the uh what came down from from head office . um <EOS>
'kay . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> i have everything . <EOS> okay , so <EOS> i have a copy . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> are you sure of that ? <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> two <EOS> six seven eight nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen sixteen seventeen eighteen . <EOS>
mm . so you're saying is it possible to have a solar cell and this removable cover and <EOS> mm . <EOS> it is possible , but , well if it <EOS> and a and a banana . <EOS> mm . <EOS> i dunno . <EOS> i dunno how to how to do it if if t if to if it's better to put the solar cell to the t to the peeling or outside it , or or inside . <EOS> but then it must be some window there , you know . <EOS>
so <EOS> where <EOS> okay . <EOS> do you need this <EOS> or just write on the white board ? <EOS> no , <EOS> i actually don't have like a powerpointy thing , <EOS> 'cause i think it would be redundant . <EOS> okay . <EOS> right . <EOS> okay . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> moment . <EOS> ooh . <EOS> uh th the the main points in uh this uh uh in this uh meeting is i think uh how uh it's going to look <EOS> uh with uh <EOS> we must keep it simple , <EOS> but have the opportunity to uh have more options <EOS> and have them uh hidden or something , <EOS> so they don't uh you don't have a big uh thing full of uh buttons <EOS> or uh um and uh <EOS> the point that uh you uh wanna use one uh controller uh for uh uh hypothetically each television , <EOS> so you must uh the the the <EOS> the functions , know , like the menus or the the parental control must be all uh by the done by the remote control and not by the television . <EOS> i think that's the point what uh <EOS>
th <EOS> right . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> right . <EOS> i think so . <EOS> that's cool . <EOS> probably . <EOS> i think we could design into that . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> good . <EOS> um yeah <EOS> i think this material quality as well like i guess what we can think about what kind of <EOS> um uh you know apple 's been really successful with this surgical white kind of business or this sleek kind of <EOS> you know <EOS>
that should come up . <EOS> mm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah yeah . <EOS> so shall we go through quickly and just work out what we've decide on , <EOS> if we have to kind of <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> so but <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
is this okay ? <EOS> uh yeah . <EOS> fine now . <EOS> oh , <EOS> it's not liking us , <EOS> it went that-a-way . <EOS> computer adjusting . <EOS> oh . <EOS> uh . <EOS> okay . so . right . <EOS> you ready back there ? <EOS> uh okay . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> 'kay basically um <EOS> i can add pretty pictures to this . <EOS> assuming the hand the hand to be in about sort of this position , um hol uh holding the remote , <EOS> the um the joystick unit should rest over the uh the joint of the f of the uh four finger <EOS> so that it's directly accessible for the thumb . <EOS> um and it would need t there would need to be a it would need to be articulated just below that <EOS> so that it could be switched around for uh left or right handed users . <EOS> so . <EOS> you then have a grip section <EOS> that can be more or less the same irrespective of handedness . <EOS> you just have big two big buttons <EOS> that cover most of the area so it can in the upper part , one for the four finger , one for the middle finger . <EOS> um , and that <EOS>
alright . <EOS> okay uh <EOS> i think that there were too many powerpoints in the meetings . <EOS> 'cause the plug-in and the plugging spent we spent a lot of time doing that . <EOS> and a lot of the information on the powerpoints , i don't think , you know , we needed to actually it could have , we could have gone through it verbally , <EOS> especially my slides , <EOS> i felt that they just you know <EOS> as opposed to having to present them . <EOS>
'kay . <EOS> and the buttons wha what is the buttons made of , rubber ? <EOS> uh they'll be rubber , yep . <EOS> so we need one of them . <EOS> and are they any special form ? <EOS> well <EOS> yeah , <EOS> like the compass point one . <EOS>
take it easy . <EOS> 'kay , <EOS> i make a cat of it . <EOS> i i was gonna make a cat too . <EOS> use your fantasy . <EOS> oh , <EOS> not too quick . <EOS> just hold it more more to the back <EOS> then you don't have <EOS> okay . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> i dunno . <EOS> ma on on most <EOS> on most uh uh remote controls it's red . <EOS> so <EOS> maybe depends on uh <EOS> yeah , i know . <EOS> okay , we make it red . <EOS> yes . <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
the aim is to reach uh uh to sell as much as fifty million euros . <EOS> uh that's quite a big amount of money . <EOS> and the production cost should be the half of the selling price . <EOS> so we have to s <EOS> okay <EOS> now it's time for some discussion . <EOS>
a be <EOS> well it uh <EOS> it's weird . <EOS> could be everything . <EOS> mm . <EOS> with a tail and a mouth . <EOS> maybe when i put on <EOS> it has wings ? <EOS> turtle . <EOS> this thing <EOS> it could be a turtle , or a snail , and <EOS>
we will get information <EOS> and then we'll come back in . <EOS> okay . <EOS> . <EOS> thank you everybody . <EOS> okay . <EOS> so maybe we'll meet in maybe five minutes ? <EOS> yeah , we'll come . <EOS> and we'll discuss the other other aspects . <EOS>
something with the shape of the palm ? <EOS> mm-hmm mm-hmm mm-hmm . <EOS> some finger grips maybe . <EOS> you could even have some buttons like you know on the sides and everything , <EOS> but <EOS> yeah . <EOS> on the sides . <EOS> yeah yeah . <EOS> it sh it shouldn't it shouldn't be symmetric symmetrical . <EOS> not anymore . <EOS> that's what <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> and then we can we can still use the voice recognition , but maybe then for only the the channels . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> uh . <EOS> that's safe . <EOS> i'm wondering um what will the voice recognition mean for the production price ? <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> and for the speech uh recognition part , if we want to incorporate that , we need a microphone . <EOS> yeah <EOS> so it should be <EOS> i mean if you have it in your hand here , should be on top somewhere , maybe . <EOS> i mean i <EOS>
yeah <EOS> and and fighting for the remote would not be fun anymore , <EOS> and i think that's one of the things we wanna keep . <EOS> so but what if you actually had to press a button to make it recognize ? <EOS> so if you pressed it and went , up ? <EOS>
and i'm marketing . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> there you go . <EOS> so <EOS> user interface designer , that's that's <EOS> that's you , <EOS> so you gotta you go , you're you're gonna be the one that's working out what what buttons we need . um . <EOS>
um right . uh well <EOS> what i did was uh i i checked uh remote controls <EOS> and the uh remote controls of today are all infrared , <EOS> not like all probably know . <EOS> and the thing about that is um the remote controls uh have to act as a t_v_ or uh a stereo or something , <EOS> and those uh have a transmitter <EOS> that's also focused on infrared , <EOS> so if we want to uh build uh mm a remote control uh with bluetooth for instance then uh the t_v_ should have bluetooth too in order to communicate , <EOS> so that would mean extra cost for the user <EOS> and thus uh that's <EOS> that wouldn't mean a a cheap uh remote control for us . <EOS> so that's probably why most controls are still infrared . <EOS> furthermore they all have uh a a very simple structure , <EOS> so that would probably uh mean lower costs <EOS> and uh <EOS> i <EOS> that could mean for us a good thing <EOS> uh 'cause uh well we we should be able to build a relatively cheap uh a cheap uh remote . <EOS> well uh <EOS> as i mentioned ready , we have some bluetooth <EOS> well <EOS> it may be possible , <EOS> but uh i figured it wouldn't be possible in within our budget , <EOS> but that's not for me to decide , <EOS> but that's maybe something for marketing to look into . <EOS> f <EOS> because uh well my personal opinion is uh is not to do uh bluetooth or or radio waves , <EOS> although <EOS>
okay . <EOS> that's <EOS> um because uh , you know , you can uh you can make it uh you have different choices with different financial models . <EOS> yeah , but uh before we talk about uh the finance , okay , uh do you have some idea how we can uh sell this product or project in the market <EOS> and how much is going to benefit to the company and uh of course it's to the individual also . <EOS>
right . <EOS> that's what i'm that's what i'm talking about is is that we have to find something that is gonna be very attractive about this product <EOS> 'cause somebody , some people are gonna be hap unhappy <EOS> 'cause it took they can't ac access their teletext . <EOS> okay . <EOS> 'cause we're talking about eighty percent or ninety percent or ninety-five percent of the televisions out there are are teletext . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> yeah <EOS> it's just because there was no actual definition for what a joystick might be , <EOS> that that's what i've labelled it for the purposes of this evaluation . <EOS> so <EOS> the l_c_d_ basically is the big selling point of <EOS> if we remove the l_c_ display , we could save ourselves <EOS>
we don't ? no ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> well i think i think es essentially what we're doing right now is we're categorising . <EOS> we're saying well we want this to be a product that offers all the sort of more tricky features but we want them to be in another area ? <EOS> is that right ? <EOS> is that what we're we're doing ? <EOS> we're kind of like sorting them an or are we actually eliminating things we just don't want the product to have ? <EOS>
'kay . <EOS> yeah it's a lot of pressure . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> sorry for my uh not finished presentation uh . <EOS> that's okay . <EOS> oh yeah . <EOS> oh no no . <EOS> yeah we'll kick your ass later . no . uh . <EOS> bring it on . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> and it's this one . <EOS> yep . <EOS> go for it . <EOS> yep . <EOS> okay . so . <EOS> s next uh slide . <EOS> okay . so i received an email um around lunchtime letting me know that the brilliant minds at our technology division had developed an integrated programmable sample sensor sample speaker unit , <EOS> um which is a way for you to have a conversation with your coffee machine and or remote control . <EOS>
so i was thinking that uh um a really simple a really simple interface with just a couple of scroll things on it um <EOS> hmm . <EOS> and then instead of a display the display could appear on the television screen . <EOS> like i guess an existing sky or cable one does . <EOS> like , you know , <EOS> you press enter <EOS> and it comes up with what's showing on that channel at the moment , <EOS> and you can do <EOS> you can scroll along <EOS> and it'll show you what's on in the next half hour , <EOS> and you scroll up <EOS> and you can see what's on the other channels while you're watching the same channel on the screen . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> sorry , <EOS> cou could you go back for a second ? <EOS> uh switching on off channel , uh volume , <EOS> okay , that's great . <EOS> 'kay . <EOS> um um among the findings i found that m m most of the curr mm presently available remote controls also include other mm functionalities um in their design , like operating a v_c_r_ , <EOS> but they don't seem to be able to deal with d_v_d_ players , <EOS> but then there are surely there are many other functionali functions that could possibly be added to them , <EOS> but according to the last minute update um actually um we do not want to have all this complicated functions added to our design . <EOS> so my personal preferences would be uh to keep the mm the whole remote control small um just like the physical size . <EOS> and then it must be easy to use , <EOS> so it must follow some conventions um like whereabouts you find the on off button <EOS> and maybe the colour tends to be red or something . <EOS>
oh well , never mind . <EOS> um . <EOS> right , so that's finances <EOS> and i dunno what we <EOS> what could we reckon we could add ? <EOS> um <EOS> well maybe we could add something , <EOS> but maybe if <EOS> what do you th <EOS> we're trying to save money , so . <EOS> yeah , if we're happy with the design there's no point in spending money , if we don't have to . <EOS> but if there is anything you think we've missed out there , then , you know , feel free to add it . <EOS> maybe <EOS> i mean obviously it would be bigger so there might be more space for the the slogan on the front , <EOS> because it's not in an ideal place right now . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> finished . <EOS> thank you very much . <EOS> so <EOS> we have to keep talking english now ? <EOS>
alright , that's me done . <EOS> alright . <EOS> okay , gabriel . let's um let's let's hear from you about the um it's the interface . <EOS> alright . <EOS> yeah , some of what i have to say ties into what catherine was just talking about . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i think this is the <EOS> yeah . <EOS> the factor that we've been least successful in confronting . <EOS> okay . <EOS> perhaps a metallic <EOS> or or <EOS> like that's grey , and it wouldn't be that expensive to have a little bit of metal . <EOS> no ? <EOS>
so we can emphasise on this point also like , <EOS> because it will definitely enhance our sales in this ag in this particular age group from uh fifteen to thirty five , <EOS> and i uh and i think that most of the users of the rem uh t_v_ are belong to this age group . <EOS> so we should look <EOS>
y <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> uh-huh . <EOS> yeah , okay , true . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay , no problem . <EOS> and i think i would it would make even more fancy because you have another interesting thing on the side <EOS> which you can touch <EOS> and <EOS>
we're we will have to find a s a regular standard chip to to do this with <EOS> and i i um i'm i'm i'm certain that they they are around <EOS> so , um <EOS> that i don't think is a a serious problem . <EOS> the uh the the voice sensor is is expensive <EOS> but we we made a a basic decision that that was absolutely fundamental to the to the design <EOS> so that that has to stay . <EOS> um then again the the the the shape of the case means that it's it's expensive to uh um l to make 'cause of the the th the double curves <EOS> but on the other hand because of our overall fashion concept um we we should exceed the the sales targets . <EOS> um it's simply made of plastic <EOS> so th that's uh that's no problem <EOS> and uh um <EOS> just because the whole the colour of the the whole thing that's uh uh there's some cost there . <EOS> um and uh <EOS> we haven't actually got a scroll wheel <EOS> we we we got push buttons and and a simple uh um slider <EOS> so um <EOS> and the and the the buttons are <EOS> uh uh well <EOS> i do don't know that they're special colour . <EOS> anyway <EOS> the the costings uh come in at exactly on target at twelve point five <EOS> uh but i thi i think we have a a very strong case to argue that uh what what we've got is is so in innovative and uh and different <EOS> that um any any slight compromise we have to make on on cost is is offset by the uh you know the uh you know the the the the concept of it being a a fashion accessory and and having the the interchangeable covers <EOS> so uh um you know <EOS> the if if <EOS> if the management expect us to be techno again fail again technologically innovative um that they they have to accept that we we can't operate absolutely within uh the constraints that they give , <EOS> so uh <EOS> we we we present this as the uh the company's uh the the company's way forward <EOS> and uh uh <EOS> i i think we can argue that we we have uh come in on on budget . um . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> i know what because it's on the television . <EOS> the television tells me what channel it's on when i change it . <EOS> so i don't know that really that's that's gonna be a a d problem , <EOS> 'cause the television can go automatically from channel five to channel thirty two with the push of a button . okay ? <EOS> so ca can we can we create that kind of interface within a scroll system ? <EOS> you understand what i'm saying ? <EOS>
can you find it as a j_ peg ? <EOS> no . <EOS> no , <EOS> isn't possible . <EOS> but you can make a screen shot , i think . <EOS> okay , well i uh <EOS> no . <EOS> no . <EOS> i hereby officially close the meeting <EOS> and uh i hope to see you uh soon . <EOS>
that's a good idea . <EOS> interesting . <EOS> that sounds , <EOS> yeah it's gonna have to be it's gonna be have a big yellow foam ball , yeah , sorry . <EOS> and then ch children will love it . <EOS> oh yellow , yellow ball . right . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> m more of a l lamination perhaps . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so then for the scroll , are we going for the ipod type ? <EOS> yeah i think so . <EOS> i think <EOS> yeah ? <EOS> okay . <EOS> which will require a more expensive chip-on-print right ? <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . okay . <EOS> okay , <EOS> the final point , trends . <EOS> and following the trends . <EOS> so <EOS> the trends were the fruit and vegetables and the spongy feel . <EOS> the trends . <EOS> mm . mm . <EOS> so <EOS> as it is , not really doing either of them . <EOS>
wow , so they're kinda spiritual . <EOS> so , that's why i like cats . <EOS> well done . <EOS> there we are , that's me . <EOS> okay . <EOS> mm . <EOS> um , i don't actually have a favourite animal , <EOS> but for the for th for this meeting i'll s draw a little <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> i think i thought the , like you said , like scroll next to the remote isn't that handy . <EOS> i think it's better to just up what you'd like to do on the screen . <EOS> if you want to go back you have to back button go back , <EOS> if you want to choose audio settings you press audio settings and it goes to that s sub-menu . <EOS>
this is <EOS> let me just skip ahead to see <EOS> that's the last thing , <EOS> okay . <EOS> we've only got a couple of minutes . <EOS> does anyone have any first ideas to bounce around about um what we're thinking of this remote control ? <EOS> yep . <EOS> i'm just wondering whether whether there is like any special feature that we want to have w want this remote control have as opposed to the already existing ones . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> well <EOS> this is a remote control , a very old one . <EOS> um then the components . <EOS> the case has just a here's black . <EOS> but we are making it uh yeah , <EOS> we make it som <EOS> maybe we have to make it from soft material . <EOS> uh i'm not sure . <EOS>
uh , for turn turn the ball . <EOS> if you want to turn the ball , it's very it's very convenient for you to to to turn the ball to change the channel . <EOS> i have no idea , so . <EOS> i have no idea what <EOS> and where is the voice recognition ? <EOS>
that's right , yeah , we need that , yeah . <EOS> okay , so it's uh <EOS> yeah . <EOS> basis station . <EOS> yeah , yeah . <EOS> basis station , <EOS> thank you . <EOS> alright , so we need uh <EOS> okay . <EOS> can you go quickly please ? <EOS> okay . <EOS> so we are going to add uh also um you as you suggested the whee some wheels to control the volumes and channels <EOS> and your tur turbo turbo uh button . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> is this me being like , guys do you like me ? um . <EOS> good leadership , i think we stayed on task . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah we did . <EOS> we've , uh <EOS> seeing as we've come out with what we intended . <EOS> a pro um a product within the budget . <EOS> i think that's a sign of good leadership <EOS> and also our personal coach helped us along the way , <EOS> so you know <EOS>
i'm pretty happy with it too , yeah um , <EOS> it's something i think i can market . yeah . <EOS> even i'm happy . <EOS> um an <EOS> yeah . <EOS> um then celebration . <EOS> celebration . <EOS> today we have apple juice and after we sell m million of 'em we have champagne . <EOS>
yes . <EOS> yeah <EOS> so it's something like this , the model here <EOS> s you can put the keys <EOS> mm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> but i've seen also with keys and buttons on the top of here as well . <EOS> that's what you mean ? <EOS>
uh <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> but the the question is n does those modularity increase the production cost or decrease the production cost ? <EOS> i think it inc increase . <EOS> well you can if you had uh something li <EOS> i think it i increases . <EOS>
uh-huh . uh-huh . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> that would be another way to do it . <EOS> so that if that was in the the voice recognition , that would be great . <EOS> yeah , but then the code word would be even more important , <EOS> because i mean sky advertise on every channel , don't they , you know , <EOS> so then it would be you'd be watching charmed , and then the sky advert would come on and it would change to sky . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> no input , like this . <EOS> shift . <EOS> no it's not . <EOS> yeah , it's not working . <EOS> should we ask meli <EOS> should we ask our technical expert melissa ? <EOS> no , it's 'cause the uh the shift button's stuck , or something . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> so , what i prefer , okay , so you need to interact with the christine more and uh within her team , okay , who is using the functional design or technical design , okay , <EOS> and uh you need to come up with some kind of plan , okay , how we are going to do the your sales plan , okay , <EOS> th <EOS>
yeah , okay . <EOS> okay , <EOS> but <EOS> switch to another category of functions . yeah . <EOS> for example , if you have remote control you you can rem you can control your t_v_ <EOS> and also you can control your uh recorder . <EOS> with a so there's a different functions , <EOS> but i if you you there's a button you can switch between control t_v_ and control your recorder . <EOS> so we can has less buttons . <EOS> but what i'm not so sure is about how to make the remote control look funny look fancy , not funny . <EOS> because different people have a different opinion about fancy . you know . <EOS>
so you don't have a <EOS> thank you . <EOS> a fish . <EOS> right . a fish . <EOS> that's a that's a fish ? <EOS> okay , <EOS> let's try to draw something . <EOS> you forgot the chips . <EOS> oh yeah , <EOS> doesn't look so fine . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> and what's your name ? <EOS> paul wiezer . paul wiezer . <EOS> w_i_e_s_ z z_ or s_ ? <EOS> uh uh zee . okay . <EOS> what's your name ? <EOS> a_ e_ z_ zee zee <EOS> e_ r_ . <EOS> uh martijn . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> but your surname . <EOS>
channel is just up and down . <EOS> okay , yeah . <EOS> and then add a <EOS> something that looks mayb you know . <EOS> such as , yeah , the one the one over there on the left the engineering centred one . <EOS> y right , right right right . <EOS> that one ? <EOS>
do a lot of um <EOS> what was that last wee bit there ? <EOS> speech recognition , right okay . <EOS> but that was only for young people that preferred it , older people didn't . <EOS> um about speech recognition ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> youn young people pref <EOS> yeah , <EOS> they s they said that they'd be interested in a remote control which offered that possibility <EOS> and as you go up through the age groups , people got less and less interested in sort of a a remote control that you could talk to , so . <EOS>
it's sitting down . <EOS> sorry ? <EOS> uh . <EOS> it's your best friend <EOS> and your you can talk to a dog , <EOS> it can be your best friend , <EOS> it doesn't discriminate between you , based on what you are . <EOS> second it's loyal <EOS> and third thing it's got intuition . <EOS> dogs can som sometimes can make out between a thief and a person <EOS> so basically these are the three unique features i think belong to a dog . <EOS> thank you . <EOS>
yeah <EOS> so you can just go on the street <EOS> and then switch off everyone's t_v_ <EOS> and you can just walk away <EOS> you don't have to be near the t_v_ at all . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i i feel i i <EOS> i think m mael will will consider this uh th these things . <EOS> maybe maybe we can go to to your presentation uh matthew . <EOS> i i i assume you were finished here . <EOS> uh okay . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah <EOS> so . <EOS> um , yeah . <EOS> so u um i have uh received some some some some well points of of thinking over of my account manager <EOS> and uh i would like to share them with you . um <EOS>
okay , so if it selled uh by its own i it it would rather be for multiple device . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> do you agree ? <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so maybe it should be for multiple devices . <EOS> and also it have , i it may be it may be important for the remote control to be uh to , to resist to various shocks that can happen if it fall . <EOS>
um <EOS> desktop . <EOS> well <EOS> it isn't on the desktop . <EOS> hey . <EOS> mm ? <EOS> i do not know . <EOS> you can only save it in my documents . <EOS> oh ? <EOS> oh my god . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> oh . <EOS> oh , alright . <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
i think it's uh it's a two , at least . <EOS> yeah . yeah , <EOS> you can make it a two . <EOS> a two , yeah ? <EOS> two , three and <EOS> what do you think ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> it's not perfect , but <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> i dunno <EOS> and an maybe we maybe even have this as in-house technology . <EOS> this may be something that's available through our own uh through our own services . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> might be , <EOS> but tha that's not gonna be such a costly feature . <EOS> the problem we're gonna have is making it robust . <EOS>
i wouldn't think so , <EOS> 'cause we could probably get it from like , in bulk , from a a newer company . <EOS> and they tend to sell their chips pretty cheap . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> okay . <EOS> ready ? <EOS> um yep , <EOS> nothing here . <EOS>
mm . 'cause current remote controls they are never easy enough to use . <EOS> makes sense . <EOS> so , make a click , please . <EOS> so here is this remote control . <EOS> it's quite a standard one , <EOS> but it's not from a t_v_ , <EOS> it's from a much easier device like air conditioning or something . <EOS> but you know , we can use it for a t_v_ easily . <EOS> only buttons we need is on off , volume , channels and maybe some options or something else , <EOS> and please make a click , <EOS> compared to this one <EOS>
switch on . yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so sounds crazy . <EOS> i like crazy ideas . <EOS> that's why you're a marketing guru . <EOS> okay . <EOS> so i it looks like we're going completely to forget about the l_c_d_ thing . <EOS> yeah , of course . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah okay but this is function so if you can use them for multiple things <EOS> and you you have <EOS> most of the time you have one button in the middle . it says menu , <EOS> and then if you press it you the screen gets activated and then you can use these buttons to scroll up and down and left and right to go into functon <EOS> and then just <EOS> mo most of the time this menu button is also like okay , to to confirm a a kind of action . <EOS> so you scroll into it , okay . <EOS> you select a function like v like uh bass . <EOS>
it's a micro array , okay . <EOS> oh . <EOS> okay , <EOS> and you have the <EOS> there's the technology inside that recognise simple vocal comments ? <EOS> and you can turn it so maybe it's techno technologically innov innovative ? <EOS> yeah , yeah . <EOS> so you can capture voice yeah , you c <EOS>
yeah , sleeping . <EOS> ah , that's not the ecological part , yeah . <EOS> that's true . <EOS> w that why we have the solar ti yeah . <EOS> so <EOS> three . <EOS> solar . <EOS> to compensate . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> so , which number ? <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> mm yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> i g <EOS> yeah . <EOS> time is it ? <EOS> fourteen twenty six . <EOS> okay . <EOS> lovely to see you all again . <EOS> um it's our conceptual design meeting <EOS> and it's starting at approximately fourteen twenty five <EOS> and so we have forty minutes for this one again <EOS> and so we'll go just after three o'clock . <EOS> um okay <EOS> our agenda , <EOS> we're gonna do an opening , <EOS> i'm gonna review the minutes of the last meeting , <EOS> then we'll have your three presentations um <EOS> and then we'll have to make a decision on the remote control concepts , <EOS> and finally we'll close . <EOS>
um . well <EOS> but if we're gonna use a touch screen where it's gonna come on like on your cell phone <EOS> it'll have your your carrier provider name come up first like while it's loading <EOS> and then it goes away , <EOS> perhaps it could be like a temporary <EOS>
mm . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> our case design . <EOS> we have uh choices in materials <EOS> and choices in the general shapes that we can do . <EOS> our material choices are a plastic latex um ty or plastic , a rubber latex type thing , uh wood , or titanium . <EOS> if we go with titanium we're gonna be uh limited in the amount of shapes we can do <EOS> because it's tough to shape the titanium , and uh <EOS> yeah pers <EOS>
yeah , it's alright . <EOS> yep . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> just <EOS> is that okay ? <EOS> okay . <EOS> yep . <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> there's already a document in the folder about it . <EOS> yeah , me too . <EOS> so <EOS> see you in thirty minutes . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> um , yeah . <EOS> um <EOS> i think are you are you maybe kind of thinking what we absolutely have to have and what would be nice ? <EOS> uh , to start with um sort of a bit both , <EOS> um we need to find out exactly what we have to have <EOS> um and after that we can add things if they're possible . <EOS>
that's uh <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> where's the money , maybe . <EOS> yeah , who wou who would have the money to spend . <EOS> well i if if like twenty five euro is our is our selling price then you can imagine , <EOS> well i don't <EOS> i'm not really sure how much that will retail at . <EOS> but you want <EOS> it's somebody who's not gonna just use the remote that comes with their telly , i suppose , <EOS> they're gonna actually go out and buy one . <EOS> so , who do you think we're aiming this at ? <EOS>
oh . <EOS> never mind . <EOS> ah , it's maybe better if you leave it . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> maybe we should just continue . <EOS> yeah , don't worry about it . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> , no worry . <EOS> no . <EOS> so good um <EOS> so , let's talk about money . <EOS> uh we are going to to sell we want to sell uh this remote control for twenty five euro euro . <EOS> and uh our expected profit will be around fifty million euro . <EOS> and uh we are trying to to have a market all around the world . <EOS> so n not only for switzerland , but for the world . <EOS> uh . <EOS> so , um . <EOS> the <EOS> we expect a production cost of maximum uh twelve point fifty euro . <EOS>
mm 'kay . <EOS> do you want me to d um <EOS> do you want me to do my um design evaluation last ? <EOS> yeah i wasn't really sure what that was <EOS> maybe we should do the design evaluation first . <EOS> or <EOS> yeah <EOS> , yeah go for that first . <EOS> i wasn't entirely sure what uh who was supposed to be doing that , <EOS> but y you go for it . <EOS>
what are you i don <EOS> no idea , so <EOS> yeah , that was the eyes . <EOS> okay . <EOS> a clown . <EOS> rabbit . <EOS> it's a rabbit . <EOS> pikachu . <EOS> it's a rabbit . <EOS> oh yeah . <EOS> bugs bunny one . <EOS>
means buttons are in the shape of fruits , <EOS> buttons are in the frape shape of fruits or something , apple , banana , something like that . <EOS> yeah maybe the shape the shape <EOS> no , not n not not too much focus , not too much focu not n not too s not too similar to a fruit because next year the ten the trend the trend will be different . <EOS> so we shouldn't be at re really attached <EOS>
fine . <EOS> we don't have cafeteria . <EOS> what do you mean by cafeteria exactly ? <EOS> he means reading room . <EOS> a place n what mm uh we can take a coffee also . <EOS> what <EOS> no , there is no coffee in the reading room . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> and i see them as majestic , oh sorry . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> and independent , and proud . now , who would like to go next ? <EOS> 'kay . <EOS> yeah , me . <EOS> cat . <EOS> where did this come from ? <EOS>
oh the advanced buttons . right . <EOS> oh yeah . yeah yeah yeah yeah . right . yeah that's good idea . <EOS> that's <EOS> the the more advanced options were uh for the for the menu . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> but you you want <EOS> okay . you just want to hide them all ? <EOS> the oh . <EOS>
no . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> but we can integrate that with volume and previous and next , <EOS> so you have <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i i think you ha really have to divide between functions you often use , like um uh m maybe uh switch channels and uh volume and k that kind of things , and uh the menu button . <EOS> because you n almost never use menu button . <EOS> so <EOS>
okay , cool . <EOS> clay . i wasn't expecting that . <EOS> clay . <EOS>
so at this stage , i mean , is this the last meeting of the project ? <EOS> we don't uh have another one after it's gone gone to marke market or something ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> no , <EOS> i think when this meeting's finished like officially , there b we'll get a uh questionnaire to fill in . <EOS> or six , uh <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> um and we've got a rubber skin material basically throughout . <EOS> um . push button interface um with this other drop-down <EOS> so maybe we've got two push button interfaces <EOS> don't we ? <EOS> yeah , mm-hmm . <EOS> um . <EOS> and um a special <EOS> i guess it's uh we've got a sort of a wood materi a rubbery type material that throughout , <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
hand light , yeah . <EOS> yeah <EOS> maybe like the infrared like we can put some mm-hmm . <EOS> radium chips or something so that like at least um <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> that <EOS> iradium ? <EOS> ah sorry . mm . <EOS> and um the remote control's going to be smart <EOS> but how smart should it be to not to complicate things too much ? <EOS>
i i thought it was a little tricky having to hand around this thing . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> we had a lot of the um <EOS> otherwise the technology today was kinda cool . <EOS> i think . yeah . <EOS> that was really neat how i got emails <EOS> and <EOS>
right . <EOS> okay , <EOS> so i guess we need , you know , something that can fit a banana shaped object . <EOS> mm-hmm . yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> uh , we have a r_f_ for um for beeping for beeping . <EOS> we need b r_f_ to beep . <EOS> so we that means we need a button on th on the on the basis . <EOS>
work now ? <EOS> yeah okay , <EOS> but i don i do i think becau that's because <EOS> perhaps it is e <EOS> it does work , <EOS> but sometimes it doesn't erase <EOS> or it doesn't uh <EOS> yeah , <EOS> perhaps it is easier to get one of those uh dig digital pens or so <EOS> and to uh and lay it next to that keyboard over there . <EOS> so you can draw uh see it over th on the screen . <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
and uh there was another section on our on the report for uh l_c_d_ displays , <EOS> but the data wasn't there , <EOS> so . i don't actually know what the results for that were , <EOS> so . <EOS> may be incrementally emitting , <EOS> but yeah . <EOS>
when we can down to it . <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> right . <EOS> creativity . <EOS> creativity . <EOS> just resources . <EOS> but yeah . <EOS> right <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> okay <EOS> the fruit and veg idea . <EOS> great . <EOS> leadership ? <EOS>
all hooked up . <EOS> okay , so <EOS> now we are here at the functional design meeting . <EOS> um hopefully this meeting i'll be doing a little bit less talking than i did last time <EOS> 'cause this is when you get to show us what you've been doing individually . <EOS> the agenda for the meeting , i put it in the sh shared documents folder . <EOS> i don't know if that meant that you could see it or not . <EOS>
but i t i think what the the management recommendation was less that there's a worry that teletext will become outdated rather than we shouldn't have it . <EOS> so i i still think if it's cheap enough functionality-wise to include , it really should be in there . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> yeah yeah yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> like a phone yeah , like the backlight in a phone . <EOS> okay cool . <EOS> okay . <EOS> like a phone , yeah yeah . <EOS> whereas with phones , people charge them once a week . <EOS> we're gonna need to put in a really good battery so people don't have to charge their r remote control every few days . <EOS>
uh it can be a plastic one , <EOS> hard plastic , so that it can be strong , <EOS> even if you just uh uh , you know , if you if it falls down , then it doesn't break . <EOS> so it should be strong . <EOS> and uh uh there are no harmful materials used in that . <EOS> and it should be recyclable . <EOS>
i can oh yeah . <EOS> okay . yeah . <EOS> see if it works this way . no , it doesn't work here . <EOS> okay no problem . <EOS> um okay , <EOS> what are we going to do ? <EOS> uh our project aim is as you can see a new remote control . <EOS> it has to be original , trendy , and user friendly . <EOS> so these are uh the points why uh we also hired you . <EOS> we've got the marketing expert for uh the trendy and user friendly look . <EOS> and industrial designer uh there's also user friendly and a bit original . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> well tha that first point could uh also be an op opportunity <EOS> because in seeing that teletext is becoming outdated , some sort remote control that can work with the internet there is the opportunity that's presented , i guess . <EOS> right . yeah . no , i i agree with you . <EOS> so what i'm talking about is i see that one side we're eliminating something so we have to come up with another side <EOS> which is , what are we gonna be targeting our market uh that identifies our product as better than because it doesn't have teletext it has ta-ta-ta-ta-ta . <EOS> so that's that's that was my reactions . <EOS>
leap . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> i think the most important thing is an attractive streamlined remote control <EOS> and to be extraordinarily reductionist , power , channel , volume and everything else is is uh up to the designers . <EOS> and this is this is also supported by the market research . <EOS>
so one plus one would be eleven , <EOS> or <EOS> oh . <EOS> you press a plus button ? <EOS> oh okay . <EOS> i've never heard of that kind before . <EOS> well we just thought , we have all the numbers here , so we wanted something representative of numbers larger than ten and <EOS>
i think we should stick on very useful functions , because we want less button . <EOS> so , yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , okay . <EOS> so , turning channel , of course . volume setting . <EOS> uh just one note to the chan channel changing . <EOS> do we <EOS> will we use only two buttons , or or like numbered buttons ? <EOS> i mean those nine plus one or two ? <EOS>
yeah , yeah you don't <EOS> us yeah yeah , usually . yeah . <EOS> yeah shapes also , different shapes . <EOS> yeah that will <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> channels . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> yeah , <EOS> and also text should be very clear so that there there won't be any ambiguities and uh <EOS>
not embed <EOS> yeah , <EOS> but then with something like a touch screen could could make more menu up pop up or something . <EOS> and yeah , <EOS> if you want to uh uh s put on stand-by or change the channel , that should always be possible to do . <EOS> not first change menu options or switch something . <EOS> um , well yeah , <EOS> as you already told , give some feedback . <EOS> if the user is pushing a button he should know if the television or n at least remote is reacting and not just that the batteries may be low . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> anything to do with what you hear , right . <EOS> you you put that into audio . <EOS> and then video is anything that you can see . <EOS> um . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> okay , <EOS> and then visual <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS>
mm but i <EOS> but there is no elasticity <EOS> which could be <EOS> wooden cases <EOS> well it depends , <EOS> i mean , you have the outs the wood itself is not gonna break <EOS> so you don't have to worry too much about the case being broken , <EOS> it's the inside . <EOS> yeah but inside you know you could have you can still have some kind of cushioning that's not visible to the to the user . <EOS>
yeah with some some yellow banana <EOS> banana colour . <EOS> like . <EOS> and how about some uh some flashing standby lights ? <EOS> like you have on the samsung , <EOS> well i don't like to call brands phones , <EOS> the you know that <EOS> 'cause i remember from one of our first meetings that uh people lose their uh remote controls often . <EOS>
and we need a <EOS> probably we need a uh advanced chip then . <EOS> fine . <EOS> yeah , we probably do . <EOS> but it doesn't say anything about it , <EOS> does it ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> no . <EOS> oh yeah , <EOS> i <EOS> but we don't have any f information about the cost . <EOS>
i'm krista and i'm the industrial designer . <EOS> okay . <EOS> um so f here's our agenda for today . <EOS> um we're gonna do some tool training , project plan and discuss then close . <EOS> um so . <EOS> so our aim is to produce a remote control that is original , trendy and user friendly . <EOS> and to do this , we have to um there's certain things we have to consider about functional aspects and conceptual design of the thing . <EOS> so . <EOS> we'll get to that . <EOS> oh there it is . <EOS> right . functional design , conceptual design and detailed design . <EOS> so throughout our next couple of meetings we'll we'll be covering these things . <EOS>
no no no . 'kay <EOS> we've only got five minutes left guys <EOS> so we need to wrap it up pretty fast . <EOS> yes , a kind of scroll wheel . so <EOS> this is even more than the um mm . mm-hmm . <EOS> than the cost you gave , the sixteen euros .
so that you're just not holding it and it changes the chan <EOS> well , the other option is in instead of a scroll you just have the buttons up on the side which are on the side . <EOS> have buttons . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> now going back to the uh industrial design of it , <EOS> you know , we were looking at whether to use maybe infra-red or bluetooth . <EOS> i think , we should just go with the simplest option on everything , <EOS> uh and that would be infra-red , <EOS> energy source , that would be batteries . <EOS> uh mean we we can look into using the s , you know , the little tiny weeny batteries , all like special long-lasting batteries . um . <EOS> but a in there's no <EOS> i don't think there's any point in making a remote control unit that's gonna last for fifty years , <EOS> because technology will have changed and , you know , we won't have televisions in ten years' time . <EOS> so <EOS>
yeah , <EOS> special colours , fruity colours . <EOS> a all kind of colours ? <EOS> it's also green <EOS> or uh <EOS> is it also <EOS> no that that's just normal colour fruit colours . <EOS> normal colours , yellow <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> but it's a special colour than just rubber colour . <EOS> you have to add something to the rubber to make it green . <EOS> you don't say here's green rubber . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm yeah . <EOS> yes yes yes <EOS> bi big keys is is good thing i think . <EOS> you see ? <EOS> i agree yeah , <EOS> and not too m too many keys of course yeah . <EOS>
ah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> miniature size ? <EOS> so we uh found it kinda cool to uh name it after a lion . <EOS> okay . <EOS> he's happy with us , <EOS> so uh <EOS> he's smiling . <EOS> wow . <EOS> he does have body uh huh . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> of course uh it has to be <EOS> it will be complicated <EOS> so we'll have only these three uh main basic <EOS> uh anyway volume is not really speech recognition problem , <EOS> it's it it will be take care of our main mm . <EOS>
well ma maybe we we should further specify what target are we focusing . <EOS> i think in my opinion we should focus on on young people <EOS> because they are more open to new devi new devices <EOS> and also yeah according to the marketing report ninety p ninety five percent of young people was <EOS>
'cause you know if <EOS> well i mean maybe you don't wanna give all your kids their own remote because they'll be changing the channel all the time <EOS> but you know maybe in some households where there is you know a t_v_ for each kid , then you know , banana remote control could be fun for them as well . <EOS> might have to draw a face on it . <EOS>
green , wood , brown . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> true . <EOS> when you use titanium , silver is fancy , <EOS> but when you use silver rubber , it isn't fancy . <EOS> silver has to shine , <EOS> and rubber doesn't shine . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS>
um , another concept is what uh apple has come up with , the spinning wheel with uh l_c_ display like on the uh ipod <EOS> which i am sure most of you know about . <EOS> um and then we have the scroll button with integrated push-button , kind of like a modern a bit bulky , a bit crazy , <EOS> i don't think that's we're necessarily going for . <EOS> and uh some special components , uh ideas like uh blocking , having the ability to block channels from your for your children um and uh dedicated buttons for for commonly used uh channels and even uh ideas like secured or hidden programming <EOS> but uh i again if we go with touch screen i don't think that's a big issue . um <EOS>
um , yeah , <EOS> go for it mate . <EOS> um , n_e_z_ <EOS> n_ e_ z_ . <EOS> ebenezer . <EOS> and your role is ? <EOS> e_r_ . <EOS> i'm the marketing expert . <EOS> you're the marketing expert , okay . <EOS> next we have ? <EOS>
sh surely he's in the wrong age group . <EOS> he must be w one of a s small population . <EOS> no , no , <EOS> you <EOS> kate , you're exactly right there . <EOS> but i think the key is to get the early adopters , people who are familiar with technology <EOS> and and uh they'll be <EOS>
afternoon guys . <EOS> it's gonna be . <EOS> rock and roll . <EOS> oh . <EOS> 'kay . <EOS> so do we need to re-train mike on how to put his mic on ? <EOS> think s <EOS> we may do . <EOS> okay , can he get it all by himself this time ? <EOS>
yeah , <EOS> so something , m m instead of a necess <EOS> yeah , grip , <EOS> i'm thinking grip more than like sinking into your hands , <EOS> you know , <EOS> i and i think <EOS> i'm envisioning more like , you know , the material that you have when you sit on like a bicycle , <EOS> so that it doesn't hurt when you're sitting down for a long time , <EOS> like <EOS> i'm imagining that sort of thing , <EOS> i don't know what th that material's called . <EOS>
yeah , yeah , <EOS> it's uh it's it's fairly simple . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i say pushbuttons at least unless we get any information <EOS> but i have no idea how much more expensive a scroll wheel is than than a pushbutton , <EOS> but it's gotta be some more expensive , <EOS> so <EOS> i think it might be better to put our money into the stuff like the kinetic battery and the cool case <EOS>
it's <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> it could tie in with the fanciful design <EOS> as <EOS> uh , you know , <EOS> throw the banana , you know , just gotta keep it moving . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> 'cause it's really a quite attractive thought , <EOS> isn't it ? <EOS> it's like <EOS> yeah , <EOS> a good selling point . <EOS>
this one would be uh for grandmothers . <EOS> mm . <EOS> oh <EOS> no , <EOS> this would i <EOS> i would i would give this model to the old people actually . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> no . <EOS> yeah , grandmothers , <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS>
no , no <EOS> in indoors . <EOS> no i meant like <EOS> bicycle power . <EOS> no 'cause like cha 'cause always changing um um batteries can get like annoying . <EOS> the battery's down and <EOS> maybe , i dunno , solar charged ? <EOS> i dunno , <EOS> swi i th i th i think changing your batteries once every six months is not really a pain , but <EOS>
okay , <EOS> sorry to interrupt you , <EOS> but we have seen before that there is a new way of interacting that use wheel . <EOS> that's right . <EOS> so anyway , that didn't come into my mind , <EOS> so th that is a possibility . <EOS> these could be other kind of interfaces . <EOS> means we can have , depending on the cost , how much we can afford , we can have different kind of interfaces . <EOS> so spe buttons are something which is very everybody is familiar with . <EOS> so if you go to the market and you say that buttons are there the people know what it is , <EOS> and on top of that if we are having extra functionality people are willing to shell that twenty-five euros money which we are thinking . <EOS>
it's play-doh . <EOS> play-doh's edible . <EOS> did you know that ? <EOS> it's definitely <EOS> because kids yeah . <EOS> i used to eat it . <EOS> i've , i've definitely eaten it before . <EOS> i didn't know was edible . . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> but um , it's it's made edible 'cause , <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> i mean it <EOS> no , i mean <EOS> i mean , you could still flush it down the toilet theoretically , but <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah , anything , i mean . okay . it's bigger than the average mobile , i guess . <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
and uh it's also uh i thought think we discussed uh earlier that uh older people don't really want to use uh these extra settings . <EOS> and older people a also don't really want to use this uh th this kind of option menus . <EOS> so they want to u use one button and then something happens , <EOS> and not choose with uh this kind of uh <EOS> and you could put in a an a really s little scrolling device on the side of your uh remote , <EOS> so you could scroll scroll uh across these uh things . <EOS>
well , <EOS> it was on , <EOS> but <EOS> well <EOS> it's those laptops . <EOS> ah , <EOS> there we are . <EOS> nice . <EOS> okay . but so mm <EOS> does everybody has um experiences with uh remote controls , and i mean not the ordinary mote controls , but also a little bit different ones ? like you can use for other ? <EOS> no ? <EOS> you ? <EOS>
but if you just lift it up and say , channel one or b_b_c_ <EOS> or even i mean you could even just have it left on . <EOS> you could just put it down once on top your t_v_ <EOS> and never have to <EOS> maybe i <EOS> yeah , <EOS> have a big kind of like the satellite box or the cable box <EOS> and have it just go on the t_v_ <EOS> and then it doesn't matter where in the room you are , <EOS> you won't lose it . <EOS>
okay , <EOS> uh what about teamwork ? <EOS> um did , you wanna comment craig ? <EOS> uh , reckon that was a bit hard because we could only discuss things in the meeting . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> if we could just go up to somebody outside the meeting and have a quick talk with them , that would've been a lot easier . <EOS>
can we just put it speech recognition in it as well , <EOS> okay ? <EOS> ma <EOS> so <EOS> shall we it open then ? <EOS> so we can put all the <EOS> yeah . <EOS> the function of that in there . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS>
yep . <EOS> yeah . yep . <EOS> the u_i_ guy also uh work on that , yeah , <EOS> and for the mar our marketing expert should deliver some specs . <EOS> mm . <EOS> alright so <EOS> so we are going to go through three of your individual presentations . <EOS> but first i would like quickly to uh to decide of to give a name to the project . <EOS> so , i just put d quickly remo , <EOS> but if you have any o other names that we co could decide for just to to keep something fun for our project we we should we could discuss quickly . <EOS> any ideas ? <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> o oh it's on <EOS> sorry , <EOS> we unplugged it . <EOS> oh , i've unplugged it . <EOS> do you want me to <EOS> here , let me <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> seventy six point three percent . <EOS> it was seventy something , yeah , yeah . <EOS>
no . <EOS> mm . <EOS> what are your experiences with remote controls ? <EOS> i mean i've got we got um we had three videos , a t_v_ and a sort of amp thing all set up <EOS> so we got one of the universal remote controls , um that you programme each of your things into , <EOS> but that kept losing the signals <EOS> so we'd have to re-programme it every now and again . <EOS> i think it was quite a cheapie as well , <EOS> so that might have had something to do with it , <EOS> but that was quite good , the fact that you could
nee . <EOS> if it should be done , <EOS> if it could be done , i won't matter . yeah . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> but how would you like to implement that , <EOS> that you say volume up , and then it goes up , <EOS> or ? <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> i mean we could take we could take the battery out of it you see <EOS> and it'd probably work ninety nine per cent of the time <EOS> but you're gonna have to set up a call centre for that one per cent of the time <EOS> when people are calling <EOS> and saying oh look my remote isn't working <EOS> what am i gonna do ? <EOS> people'd be real upset . <EOS> i think in the long-run it's better to keep the battery , <EOS> it's hard to scrap the whole cell battery idea <EOS> 'cause that's so integral to the theme that we have . <EOS>
it has to be uh wha baby proof <EOS> yeah <EOS> but mainly it has to be very robust <EOS> because even if she's not very tall she's uh high enough so that uh when she throw it away it's uh <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> ah . <EOS>
ah , <EOS> don't worry about it at all mate . <EOS> uh so <EOS> you have the energy source obviously connected to the chip , <EOS> and the user interface obviously contains everything . <EOS> you have the switch turn it on , <EOS> infrared bulb , uh will contact the t_v_ <EOS> and will have whatever device or d_v_d_ player , the bulb will turn on to say it's on . <EOS> uh , so <EOS> do we need on the control uh different buttons to decide , or different light bulbs , <EOS> would it be easier ? <EOS> um , i dunno what we should decide on that . <EOS> no , <EOS> it's finished , yeah . <EOS>
that's the wrong one , i think . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> it's still bob morris . <EOS> yeah you should have put yes . <EOS> oh . <EOS> presentation three ? <EOS> because you cancelled it . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> oh . <EOS> click on yes . <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
mm 'kay . <EOS> yeah , let's let's do a lithium . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> it's . <EOS> we're gon that's gon <EOS> nologically advanced , <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yep . <EOS> it is a single-curved , so one of those . <EOS> uh . <EOS>
uh <EOS> we can make it in the shape of a coffee pot . <EOS> yeah we have the the power-adaptor products . <EOS> we sell power-adaptor products . <EOS> so for example there's nothing stopping us it's uh just it's that i think it's telling us to stop our meeting . <EOS> so we have the c we probably have have on-line in our in our system , we have the ability to create this , we're talking about . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> uh and and also it it would take more time to develop to have a a general generic remote control . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm <EOS> i it's not true i think . <EOS> the the second claim that you put . <EOS>
why am i <EOS> oh yeah . <EOS> just . <EOS> where are we ? uh . <EOS> m they've even got things like that . <EOS> huge things . <EOS> which is just for your gr ninety year old grandma yeah ? <EOS> that's industrial design for cranes , stuff like that . <EOS>
can we leave this up to you ? <EOS> yeah it doesn't matter that much . <EOS> so <EOS> but um the screen is on top ? <EOS> right okay . so <EOS> yeah i wanna close down . <EOS> i have to , sorry . <EOS> it's not because i don't like you but <EOS> yh we have lunch break , <EOS> and then we can work for thirty minutes , <EOS> and i have to write very fast to make the minich min minutes . <EOS> and then uh we'll see <EOS>
i s <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> no , no , <EOS> you you can start . <EOS> okay , i'll start . <EOS> so start , uh <EOS> can you open my presentation , <EOS> please . <EOS> uh . <EOS> i'm number four . <EOS> trend . <EOS> yep . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> uh , i can see that . <EOS> so you're not gonna find my uh my folder up there <EOS> i gotta do mine up at the board . <EOS> have you ? okay . <EOS> yeah yeah . <EOS> so <EOS> can i not get your get at stuff from your shared folder now ? <EOS>
um the point made at the end there here is that you have to be sort of be need to be clear on your um devices , as to what , you know , things you use . <EOS> sometimes an arrow pointing down , which may suggest volume down , could become confused just as a v_ for volume . <EOS> just little things like that , which would need to be made clear in the design . <EOS> um i think , d carrying on from what i've already said , a user friendly remote with minimum buttons . <EOS> maybe we've so suggested this two-part thing , where if it was to have a speech recognition thing , <EOS> you could maybe control that on the do it or program all that on the control bit . <EOS> and then just have the simple sort of hand-held thing that we sort of devised earlier , as the actual remote . <EOS> um i don't <EOS> it could be a graphical display , the actual remote contr the actual control port maybe could have like an ipod where you just sort of control through the menus . <EOS> stuff like gets more and more compli complicated . <EOS> and then the the hand-held bit should be ergonomically designed . <EOS>
yeah , just brainstorming basically . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> details uh <EOS> so are we finished ? <EOS> hmm . <EOS> yes , <EOS> i think just i just write a final report . <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> quite early . <EOS> no , <EOS> we have only four minutes left . <EOS> uh it's okay . <EOS>
which <EOS> i don't know , speak for yourself , i'm planning to be around for a while . <EOS> although i think <EOS> i think with wood though you'd run into the same types of problems , <EOS> wouldn't you , <EOS> i mean it chips , it if you drop it , <EOS> uh it's i'm not su <EOS>
'cause that , i think <EOS> i mean that fits the whole round ipod idea . <EOS> and you still have the comfort of holding it like that . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm . <EOS> and you could like if it's like this , you could put fruit designs and stuff on that part . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> and also um i will ask the market expert to uh try to find out what are the absolute requirements , what is absolutely needed in a remote control uh for the user . <EOS> so . <EOS> and then uh i will uh just ask you to think about that <EOS> and uh look at your mail because you will receive uh some good advice soon . <EOS>
cool . <EOS> cool . <EOS> um <EOS> so we could even add something . <EOS> we cou oh not quite , have the scroll-wheel , unfortunately . <EOS> what ? <EOS> we should fire the accountants . <EOS> fire the accountants . <EOS> ah yeah , we could add things . <EOS>
okay . <EOS>
yes . <EOS> okay , um <EOS> it's also uh nice to see that um we made a small uh menu , uh the options menu uh becoming available when pressing the uh scroll uh button , <EOS> and the opportunity to use the teletext , <EOS> whi which is used uh which should still be used <EOS> and we think that it's uh very handy to put it uh not uh under the options menu , but in uh yes . in an apart uh <EOS>
i don't understand it . <EOS> can you repeat it ? <EOS> well you can you can press press the teletext button <EOS> and then you then you can you can f <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so then then both the scroll buttons they are for teletext browsing . <EOS> and you can tele <EOS> yeah , <EOS> once you press the teletext button then the scroll buttons they are more for teletext , they are no more for channel or vol volume . <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
sure . <EOS> yes . <EOS> anything they think that's not been covered , <EOS> before i quickly write up a final report . <EOS> um i dunno , <EOS> i mean we've got a product . <EOS> we maybe aren't as happy with it as we'd like to be , <EOS> but we've got something <EOS> we think we can maybe stick onto the the market and sell . <EOS> and of course something we have been avoiding talking about 'cause of we've no information is selling them directly to the manufacturers . <EOS> there is a huge market . <EOS> i mean we've briefly touched on it <EOS> but we've no more knowledge <EOS> then there's little we can say on that . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> nah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i think so too , <EOS> but <EOS> and that's partly because um uh a lot of t_v_s have different menus , <EOS> and when you have a particular menu uh at your device , uh it could be that don't correspond to the menu what's actually on t_v_ . <EOS>
yes our costs are within budget . <EOS> it's evaluated generally positively . <EOS> and um don't forget to complete final questionnaire and meeting summary . <EOS> then we celebrate <EOS> in such a way that i have no idea . <EOS> yes . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
um , my second part of my findings <EOS> uh the mo <EOS> most current remotes use this silicone uh p_c_b_ board which pr printed circuit board , <EOS> which basically has these contacts that are really close together and then when you press down on the rubber button , it'll connect the circuit <EOS> and each each switch is connected to two uh different legs on the chip and so sends a different message <EOS> and that then uh gets translated by the chip into a code <EOS> and then it's fired out of this l_e_d_ in the sequence of l on and off bursts . <EOS>
uh sure <EOS> my name is agnes <EOS> and i'm an user usability user interface designer . <EOS> my name is ed <EOS> and i do accounting . <EOS> uh how you spell your name uh ? <EOS> e_d_ . <EOS> e_d_ okay . <EOS> mm . <EOS> and ? <EOS>
sure . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> that was um in cutting down the number that was kinda separate that was cutting down the number of functions , making it simpler so instead of having lots of things you put in for date <EOS> right . <EOS> right . <EOS> right , so when they press for programming you it comes up on the l_c_d_ , a reminder about using videoplus ? <EOS> so that they have a look at the guide and <EOS> or was is this nothing to do with the project requirements , <EOS> is this just that was an add-on feature ? <EOS>
p <EOS> well <EOS> the only problem i can think of with that is if you've got a lot of people that don't wanna be bothered learning how to use new rem remote controls . <EOS> if you just kind of take away everything that they're used to knowing , that's gonna be quite a change . <EOS> it might <EOS>
so the shape now . <EOS> it looks like a <EOS> now you took it . <EOS> it's too much red ? <EOS> in the basement ? <EOS> um if <EOS> it looks like a pineapple with cherry on top . <EOS> mm uh <EOS> okay . <EOS> right . so , from one to seven ? <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> great . <EOS> hi , i'm david and i'm supposed to be an industrial designer . <EOS> okay . <EOS> and i'm andrew and i'm uh our marketing <EOS> um i'm craig and i'm user interface . <EOS> expert . <EOS> great . <EOS> okay . um <EOS> so we're designing a new remote control and um <EOS> oh i have to record who's here actually . <EOS> so that's david , andrew and craig , isn't it ? <EOS> and you all arrived on time . <EOS> um yeah so des uh design a new remote control . <EOS> um , as you can see it's supposed to be original , trendy and user friendly . <EOS> um so that's kind of our our brief , as it were . <EOS> um and so there are three different stages to the design . <EOS> um i'm not really sure what what you guys have already received um in your emails . <EOS> what did you get ? <EOS>
anna . <EOS> a and i'm nanne . <EOS> so <EOS> uh so yeah uh just uh on your web page but uh yeah not uh not face to face . <EOS> yes . <EOS> so . um <EOS> s <EOS> so mm <EOS> so . <EOS> s s <EOS> mm . <EOS>
alright , yeah . <EOS> yeah , definitely , yeah . <EOS> yeah . okay , <EOS> i think we're gonna have to wrap this up um . <EOS> but if we go away with that that kind of general um specification in mind that we're looking at fifteen to thirty five year olds , we want it to look simple , but still have the buttons so it's easy to use , but only those key buttons , the major buttons and then one sort of menu one , and then voice recognition included as an option <EOS> um but that obviously needs a little bit more working out as to whether it's really feasible and some of those problems we were mentioning um . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> so um we just have to beware of that . <EOS> i mean and know whether the four thirty will really cover that . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> well as we know in today's technic technological world you can do just about anything at any price , the the the problem is quality . <EOS> so we're just gonna have to settle for whatever quality that will buy us . <EOS> and um it may not be the greatest quality but it may sell anyway . <EOS> as we've seen with so many of these kinds of products . <EOS>
mm like this ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yes so mm <EOS> like in cell phones recently <EOS> these you can with the rubber in four directions and <EOS> yeah . <EOS> but full assembly mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . yeah . <EOS> uh-huh . <EOS> okay . <EOS> we'll use mainly for titanium rubber is expensive <EOS> and also it's bit difficult to do all the shapes uh . <EOS> and this push buttons <EOS> we we would like to use push buttons instead of l_c_d_s <EOS> and so we want to mo <EOS> i mean we're we want to put speech recognition <EOS> so we want to reduce price on this technology <EOS> and so that we can have enough space or enough money <EOS> for <EOS>
'kay . <EOS> yeah yeah . <EOS> right . <EOS> i guess it doesn't matter 'cause the price on that one is zero , <EOS> which is nice . <EOS> special colour ? <EOS> exactly , right . <EOS> oh . <EOS> that's not a special colour . <EOS> it's a specially ugly colour , but it's not special . <EOS>
we <EOS> yeah it's a nice input <EOS> but we have an other inputs from the l public demands . <EOS> i think we will just have a rough look <EOS> and then we can make our statements , <EOS> and we can finalise the product based on this discu <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> you just have a a very simple chip and the mm the user interface is just done usually by push button <EOS> and in our case we are using a um a wheel control . <EOS> so uh uh i was looking basically for that chip , which is uh very very standard , and uh i just looked for the wheel sensor and the standard push button . <EOS> and um <EOS> yeah we can change directly . <EOS> in fact i have the number of that element which is very standard for remote control . <EOS> the push button are usually extremely cheap , <EOS> but i just have one problem and this is related with the wheel sensor , which seems to be quite expensive . <EOS>
okay just one . <EOS> s so so i discussed with guillaume . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> right . <EOS> and uh so we have <EOS> and we we are both agreed on some two versions of the prototypes , <EOS> because we were no not decided whether we wanted to have an l_c_d_ or not because it's too expensive . <EOS> so we come up with two versions . <EOS> one with and one without l_c_d_s . <EOS> um but both comes with a charger <EOS> and then detachable and uh or control module . <EOS> and detachable big buttons for all people um . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> well , from experience , um i've had remote controls in the past that have had very they've had lots and lots of buttons and they've been very small , <EOS> and it's been very hard to to to use , because there's so many buttons , <EOS> and you know it's very hard to see which buttons do what , <EOS> and the buttons are very small and very hard to press . <EOS> um and and normally you only every use , <EOS> you know , on a t_v_ remote you only ever use , mostly , you know , f four or f six buttons . um . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> and <EOS> maybe you have to uh put uh a small light around the button you push . <EOS> so you see green if you push that button . <EOS> huh , that's a good idea . mm i think it's unnecessary power uh you use then . <EOS>
yeah , for me it's a good timing . <EOS> uh-huh , okay . <EOS> next tuesday we have a meeting , yeah . <EOS> that might be <EOS> where is the meeting ? <EOS> it's unimail ? <EOS> yeah . exactly . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay , so , yeah yeah , then it could be that <EOS>
uh-huh , mm . <EOS> and we also need to talk about if we're only gonna have the very simple ones <EOS> or also have the other ones just separate somehow <EOS> or <EOS> hmm . <EOS> can you like <EOS> i mean this may be too complicated , <EOS> but , i wish i had something to explain it , <EOS> like if it was just a simple , either this way or this way , <EOS> that had like the main buttons <EOS> and then you could like pull something out , <EOS> kind of and like you got the rest the buttons , <EOS> but the rest of them like went in . <EOS> do you know what i'm saying ? <EOS>
mm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> oh <EOS> in that case you can you always hook up with uh someone who is providing that <EOS> and you know , you you sell their product as well as your product with them , you know . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah , but w w we want to design a new one . mm . <EOS>
so we have one button , <EOS> one wheel . <EOS> scroll wheel with push button on it . <EOS> so <EOS> it's good they're not charging anything for that . <EOS> now <EOS> so <EOS> so what are we going to do with this project evaluation ? <EOS> so <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> so <EOS> of course we need energy sources and uh uh the receiver a a receiver . <EOS> this is very quick uh design , <EOS> uh you stop me or interrupt me if uh you don't agree on it on that . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah but uh i mean e even though it has to be re original we shouldn't uh go like too far away from from the usual ones , <EOS> because otherwise the new users will just have a lot of problems <EOS> with l learning , yeah , yeah . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> but uh what would be different from this , from the others ? <EOS> i dunno if <EOS> uh maybe we can change the colours that at least the frame . <EOS> mm . s so then it depends <EOS> you are to <EOS> yeah , at least the colour would be different . <EOS>
'kay . <EOS> and it's stylish . <EOS> if they're buying it that often or they're maybe looking to replace something then , they've got a bit of free cash , <EOS> so that puts them potentially in the younger age bracket . <EOS> maybe even single , just for the reasons of um uh excess cash flow . <EOS>
hmm . <EOS> um people also had certain frustrations , <EOS> that i think that we could try to take into consideration with 'kay . <EOS> our design . that being people k um frustrated with losing their remotes . <EOS> i think , over fifty percent of the people mentioned that that was their biggest frustration . <EOS> people are also frustrated with the difficulty it is to learn how to use a remote <EOS> and i think that ties back to what you were saying before <EOS> just that there's too many buttons , <EOS> it just needs to be easy to use . <EOS> it also mentioned something called r_s_i_ <EOS> and i was hoping someone might be able to inform me as to what r_s_i_ is , <EOS> because i don't know . <EOS>
yeah , it is , yeah . <EOS> it does leave them with an obligation to <EOS> especially if they want to use it uh uh sp uh specifically as um voice activated . <EOS> then if it's just sitting on the <EOS> yeah , <EOS> because most of the people <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> bright natural colours , <EOS> nothing too <EOS> bright , but not too bright . <EOS> bright , but too not <EOS> yeah . <EOS> like no lime green or bright yellow or bright pink . <EOS> wanna make it different colours so anybody can choo like like <EOS>
right . <EOS> oh , i see , right , yeah . <EOS> oh , okay . <EOS> yeah , that's quite a good design . <EOS> since it's the one in the centre that's not marked , yeah . <EOS> okay um <EOS> we have we've about fifteen minutes left , <EOS> so i'm i'm gonna <EOS>
mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> the the press buttons . should they be white or black or <EOS> red maybe . <EOS> and it it looks quite cheap , that colour i think . <EOS> it's it's not <EOS> uh <EOS> black . <EOS> the green ? <EOS> yeah but it's pretty fresh , on the other side . <EOS>
oh i think uh , if i'm not wrong , we're making the remote control . <EOS> um i was wondering <EOS> remote controls , <EOS> 'cause i had two different things . <EOS> i had a first part of mine was to make a remote control for a new f remote control for television , <EOS> and afterward i had a discussion about coffee so <EOS> we'll start with the remote control for television then . <EOS>
it just occurred to me that they all <EOS> yeah <EOS> we only needed one computer and <EOS> we only actually needed one computer . <EOS> yeah , that's true . <EOS> if there had been a fifth , that coulda just been sitting there ready to go the whole time . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> mm yeah . <EOS> i think if we had a a locating device with the small one , i think that seems way more advanced . <EOS> i'm kind of i'm kind of leaning in the direction of this kind of <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i'm a away from the base . <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
i think it is yeah . <EOS> so uh <EOS> and also uh technologically innovative ? <EOS> yes <EOS> the voice technology indeed . <EOS> yeah , defi yeah , yeah <EOS> yeah . <EOS> easy to use ? <EOS> i don't see we could've made it any easier . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> without without some really sort of something really special to identify it as as unique in the market . but we th that should be design . <EOS> yeah . that should be the design basically . <EOS> i think technology we'd we we're not in the price range to do it . <EOS>
just just <EOS> we just had to we just had to squeeze our product a little bit and <EOS> well . <EOS> you know <EOS> fantastic . <EOS> now you guys have been a a great team . <EOS> think we're the we're the envy of all the of all the other r_r_ teams , . <EOS>
no . <EOS> you can put games on your remote control . whatever . <EOS> kid-proof . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> and uh how about the batteries ? <EOS> uh should you put it in a recharger <EOS> or a just <EOS> um <EOS> oh <EOS> maybe that's a good idea , <EOS> just to put it on your television and just s recharge , <EOS> you never have to use any batteries . <EOS>
it's uh <EOS> mm . <EOS> i think since a lot of people indicated that a new remote control is hard to learn , <EOS> and we're focusing on elderly people here <EOS> which tend to have a hard time understanding new devices , <EOS> it might be a good idea to have just a little screen on it , <EOS> which would explain a button if you press it . <EOS> which would tell you what it does . <EOS>
um i've established what the components required for the remote control to function , actually are . and then also the methods in which these components interact together for the remote to actually do what you want it to do <EOS> and how it connects with the television . <EOS> um the basic components are an energy source <EOS> which i guess um in most existing models would be a battery supply . <EOS> whether that'll be sort of two batteries , four batteries , um it may vary . <EOS> we then have the user interface , which is basically the like the the buttons on the actual remote . <EOS> um the various functions used for changing channel , uh channel up and down , volume , things like that . <EOS> um there's also a chip inside the remote which does all the computer type things . <EOS> and then the sender , which um
right here we go . <EOS> okay . <EOS> i think that i would have to say that my favourite animal is the cat . <EOS> little smiley cat there . <EOS> um and this would be because they're very independent , <EOS> uh they're very intelligent , compared to dogs maybe . <EOS> um and they can be very very affectionate . <EOS> some people don't think so <EOS> but i know very affectionate cats . um . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> well <EOS> that has another element , <EOS> which is if every time you're done using the remote you put it on a charger , then you then it has a place . <EOS> mm . <EOS> you'd never need uh batteries <EOS> would y uh <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> it sounds like the colour's something that we <EOS> well , yeah the colours are yellow and grey . <EOS> so it could be grey on the banana one . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> gray , yeah . <EOS> yeah , could be grey . <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so it's only the central part . <EOS> so basically , w software we will build will look more or less the same as these two . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> with a maybe a more ergonomic design on on the bottom part . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> i know tha <EOS> i discovered that when i did a quick look , uh they do now som they do something which is quite nice now , <EOS> you have a button , you you press it , and this is uh the previous channel which has come back . <EOS>
i suppose . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> but the rubbers alls original black . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> so you always lose the special colour . <EOS> you co you could make it always black , like normal remote . <EOS> yeah <EOS> b <EOS> yeah , <EOS> but we're gonna make it yellow uh red , <EOS> and then you add you have two special colours on top of the one we have now . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> so electronic parts are assembled onto uh printed boards <EOS> uh because it's easier to mass produce and assemble . <EOS> and uh so <EOS> i think for our design we want some b uh programmable uh you know v_ v_l_s_i_ or f_p_g_a_ uh high technology , <EOS> and this is important , <EOS> and also we'll use uh yeah like in any uh high-tech uh devices a chip of fi fibreglass to them and connect them . <EOS>
so l <EOS> five ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , okay . <EOS> i'm gonna give a seven in everything , so . <EOS> i'm happy with five ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i'm glad you're accepting this . <EOS> it has taken a little while , hasn't it ? <EOS> um intuitive but <EOS> sorry , <EOS> it's really hard to write on those . <EOS> i just went a bit mad , didn't i ? <EOS> um okay , cool , <EOS> e_ , <EOS> okay . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> and then let them look at those ideas and <EOS> they say , yeah well , we can we can raise the price twenty percent , <EOS> you know we like this idea , this idea no , <EOS> but to me it's it's about a choice , <EOS> do we follow their directives or do we make uh presentations back and and then and then discuss ? <EOS> beca i i do not i do not see the market niche for the product that they're handing f handing us right now . <EOS> i don't see it . <EOS>
yeah , it's possible . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> and then like the the covers could be spongy latex <EOS> wherea <EOS> but the actual model could be titanium . <EOS> exactly . <EOS> and you could co-ordinate with your house or whatever . <EOS> all these options . <EOS> i think maybe th the packaging , <EOS> it should be like a lemon <EOS> and the the packaging is like the peel . <EOS> so instead of opening the box you just kind of peel it , <EOS> and the remote control's inside . <EOS>
um we must not forget uh everything we draw on here , uh all must be saved . <EOS> we we may not delete anything . <EOS> so uh if you have uh drawn something , save it . <EOS> never delete it . <EOS> that's a very important uh thing . <EOS>
components design , <EOS> um uh first of all uh i would like to uh uh accommodate some of those uh things i uh uh elaborate some of the things i did . <EOS> i i elaborated on the concept . <EOS> what should be um <EOS> uh said about uh the components , uh its properties <EOS> and what kind of materials should we use to uh to make uh one of those r remote controls . <EOS> uh well <EOS> first of all i've uh d subtracted some of the components that is that are used uh are w w um you know from what uh the remote control's formed . <EOS> uh first of all , the case , the case , the surrounding of the of the the remote control . <EOS> i would like to uh give you an idea of uh how i thought about . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> or do we wanna make its shape look like a banana or something ? <EOS> i dunno . <EOS> . <EOS> yeah that's <EOS> uh bananas wierd shape and other fruits also , <EOS> so it's better to have um some sort of basic print and then a fruit print in some primary uh colours . <EOS> i don't know what what colours should the basic print be like ? <EOS> like some soft green or something ? <EOS> or and then <EOS>
mm . <EOS> would you have to leave it by the window ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm . yeah <EOS> . or you know you lose it , it lies behind the couch for a week <EOS> and yeah mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> always the you <EOS> works well in arizona but in edinburgh not so <EOS>
okay . <EOS> we we have already some good things uh with um um with the backlight of the push button . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> i have a question about that actually . <EOS> um , what is the purpose of the light ? <EOS> just to to make something which is uh slightly more design that uh a squarey box with a rubber <EOS>
go to channel twenty five . <EOS> one thing is that as i said in my presentation people really do like to z zap . <EOS> so even if they are only watching four or five channels , i think they want to zap out of the one hundred channels , <EOS> just because this is one kind of thing they do , zapping . <EOS>
so so you're not convinced about the the wood , yes . <EOS> actually , i'm ready to sell it . <EOS> i'm ready to sell it . <EOS> you're what ? <EOS> i think if you re if you use really good quality wood , then it might work , <EOS> but you can't just use <EOS>
and it's gonna cost . <EOS> it's uh of course it's uh good to uh tell the management how much it's cost us <EOS> and how much you are going to benefit , <EOS> okay . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> sure . sure . <EOS> and uh , so <EOS> i don't mind to convince , okay , the management to spend some more money on the project , okay , if you can make out of <EOS>
uh yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , no , ipods <EOS> they want all those words for presentation , even the plugs . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> well , i ipods are now quite trendy , <EOS> and they come in different colours . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> colours . <EOS> exactly . <EOS> i mean how many people went out and bough a nokia phone , back when we were like in high school , just so they could get the changeable face plates . <EOS>
uh , right . <EOS> um . <EOS> it's probably gonna be the same as one we've done before . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> in project . <EOS> but i'm not the authority to say that it is . <EOS> i guess we should end this , since we're off off topic . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> but that's easily to do with the colour , i think . <EOS> so <EOS> sorry ? <EOS> yeah <EOS> i think it's it's easier to do in colour than in shape . <EOS> because otherwise we have to get different shapes , <EOS> and colour way easier than yeah the shapes . <EOS>
mm 'kay so <EOS> three different types of design that we're gonna be concerned with okay . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> functional , conception and detailed . <EOS> i can't write with this thing . <EOS> maybe we should redesign it . <EOS> yes . <EOS> after we've finished the remote control we'll get to that . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> and then whi <EOS> which is generally used by the people . <EOS> and then <EOS> well <EOS> personal preferences <EOS> i would uh basically think of having a kind of aim for the next generation thing <EOS> where the we could have both the uh the f a t_v_ and the remote video remote control <EOS> because uh some of the keys in the video's remote control and the t_v_ they could be integrated together <EOS> so that uh we could um aim for the like in the f coming future um that type of uh applications with <EOS>
that kinda would r d <EOS> yeah . <EOS> that would kind of lose it . <EOS> well then why don't you just press the up button ? man yeah . <EOS> but if it's just one thing with a button that you can just go <EOS> that's right . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> although the the danger with that is , it could look a bit cheap . <EOS> not enough buttons you mean ? <EOS> so sorta strike a balance between a a few and a <EOS> or it looks like we're just cutting on the um <EOS>
true , <EOS> we're still not making it easier then . <EOS> yeah <EOS> we've also got the the me the thing of , <EOS> if we're gonna have a non-remote-looking remote , how do we yeah . <EOS> b but no i mean <EOS> we could do a slide or a compartment , <EOS> you know , <EOS> like if it say it's a lit little vaguely ovoidal type of thing , it'd be easy to have a compartment in there . <EOS> or you know , a b a b a a series of you know three or four buttons with a menu button and then a side an s up and down type of thing , like on um like on a d_v_d_ player . <EOS> you know <EOS> you see the modern d_v_d_ players'll just have um a menu button on the side and then four buttons around them <EOS> and you can just kind of manoeuvre through the menu like that . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> no can do . <EOS> yeah <EOS> we could just go with um <EOS> yeah w <EOS> normal coloured buttons . <EOS> well do you want colour differentiation here ? <EOS> no that's not the button we're talking about . <EOS> that's <EOS> the buttons only refer to the pad so <EOS>
yeah . yeah , <EOS> but <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> hmm <EOS> it's maybe an option uh if you use an l_c_d_ or a touch screen um , <EOS> that in the middle are the the main keys , <EOS> like displayed on the <EOS>
okay , it's uh <EOS> it's here . <EOS> would that work ? <EOS> get yourself in position . <EOS> ah . <EOS> okay , so that's me again . <EOS> um so um for the energy sources we can have a basic battery , <EOS> a hand dynamo which is which was used uh in the fifties for torches , <EOS> if you remember that kind of <EOS> which wouldn't be v wouldn't be v v <EOS> yeah , yeah . <EOS> it wouldn't be very fancy . <EOS> you can have a kinetic provision of energy , <EOS> which is used on some watches these days . <EOS> so if you have just a bit of gentle movement that it will give it the energy to work . <EOS> or you can use solar cells , <EOS> but i'm not sure about that indoors , really , but <EOS>
oh , you can put it here . <EOS> oh that's okay , it's jus <EOS> so basically um the major things we found out was that um basically users don't like the look and feel of of most remote controls that are currently on the market . <EOS> um they , you know , <EOS> seventy five percent of the people we we uh did the experiments on , found that rem remote the remote controls that they'd used in the past were ugly . <EOS> completely ugly . <EOS> um they they didn't match the operating behaviour of the user , <EOS> that is , you know , the the way users use remote controls when they're watching t_v_ . <EOS> um , that the layout of the remote controls didn't match they way that they used it . <EOS> um and thirdly they say that w half of the users that we um tested said that they only used ten percent of the buttons that uh are on remote controls . <EOS> um so we collect <EOS> we also some collected some usage statistics uh based on how these test subjects were using their remote control . <EOS> and from this we basically came up with the figure that the channel buttons , the channel selection buttons are the most by far the most used buttons on the remote control . <EOS> um and you can see they're used a hundred and sixty eight times per hour on average , um , while the user's watching t_v_ . <EOS> um the closest button that was used , <EOS> well the cl the button that was used that was closest to the channel button was the teletext button , <EOS> um which was used fourteen times per hour , <EOS> followed by the volume button , which was four times per hour , um , <EOS>
i think p spongy is good because it it will be robust as well . <EOS> plastic . <EOS> yep . <EOS> so , <EOS> i think we can keep the wheel <EOS> because it's uh easy , it's innovative , even if the cost is a bit higher , <EOS> and we also have to find a , so , a fruit like pear or banana <EOS> wit uh any others idea you have . <EOS>
functional requirements , yeah <EOS> . okay . well <EOS> my name is jens damman , <EOS> but we're in a group , <EOS> and i i will start it . <EOS> wait . um <EOS> i've used a marketing report on uh the site . <EOS> uh i think you've uh read it too . <EOS> uh and uh f and furthermore i uh surfed the o the other site . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> but still <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah uh <EOS> on zap it's only next next next next next , yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> and it's only next . <EOS> yeah <EOS> so but you have to <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm . we got these buttons here . next next . <EOS> or say this can be back . <EOS>
so <EOS> i think we should cloak the streamlined remote control device in a series of fruit fruit themed sleeves . <EOS> i think that's a good idea . <EOS> don't you ? <EOS> y yeah , you know <EOS> yes . <EOS> it sounds like the the uh covers that they use for the remote , you know , your t your cell phone . <EOS>
um <EOS> uh the big lines were like nine . <EOS> okay . <EOS> it's a dog . <EOS> well , <EOS> very good . <EOS> i just uh thought i'd pick the easiest one . <EOS> uh . <EOS> okay . <EOS> why a dog ? <EOS> you have a dog at home ? <EOS>
um yeah <EOS> i i thought so just for just for ease of not having to replace the batteries . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> and how does it get uh charged up ? <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> um . <EOS> it's um i think it works on the basis they have some kind of ball bearings inside . <EOS> it's um it's some on watches which you you kind of you shake to power it up . <EOS> somehow the mechanism inside powers up through movement . <EOS> so you'd you'd move the remote around a little bit <EOS> and then that powers it up to use it . <EOS>
um <EOS> oh yeah sorry yeah then . <EOS> right <EOS> so <EOS> should we take that off uh ? <EOS> ah . <EOS> hey it's back to the original . <EOS> um so then these just become normal coloured buttons , <EOS> so that might be some some way of cutting the cost . <EOS>
well there's a couple of things there . <EOS> um we have to remember that we have our own um logo and colour scheme . <EOS> so basically we'd have to uh we'd have to be putting that on um the the product . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> do we get to see that ? <EOS> will you be presenting that in a bit ? <EOS>
i think we've come up <EOS> i think we've covered everything we need to here . <EOS> um i think we've decided on what , you know , decided on standard items for most of um rubber and such , <EOS> so <EOS> we're now looking at the detailed design <EOS> and what we need to be doing for the next meeting . <EOS> um so for example , um <EOS> i'll just start at the top , <EOS> you've got yourself and the industrial designer gonna be working quite closely at this stage <EOS> 'cause it'll be hard not to , obviously . um <EOS> looking from prototyping of some des description using clay . <EOS> um i suppose you'll be told a lot more about that as uh progress . um <EOS>
'kay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay . so <EOS> next meeting is in thirty minutes or <EOS> so uh . don't pani . <EOS> so so i will ask the industrial designer to find out more about this industrial design so any working any working function we have discussed . <EOS>
mm i don't think it's that fashionable . <EOS> i'd give it like three or four . <EOS> well , now i'm . <EOS> so , the average is about a two . <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah , it's a two . <EOS> but then i'm not fashionable , so <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> okay , well <EOS> that's the <EOS> leave . <EOS> a disco version . <EOS> perhaps you should you'd throw them on on in one pile . <EOS> so , options , and then you sub them . <EOS> otherwise you have all those teletext , perhaps teletext not , <EOS> but <EOS>
yep . <EOS> okay . <EOS> um , yep <EOS> so there . that's all . <EOS> right . <EOS> okay , great <EOS> um are you submitting the the um evaluation criteria or am i ? <EOS> i don't know what your instructions have been . <EOS> um , i think to record it and uh i haven't been asked to submit it yet . <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> it only costs four units . uh yeah . <EOS> yea uh so <EOS> tha <EOS> actually you could make an l_c_d_ screen but no mic , or it could make mic but no l_c_d_ screen , when you look at that . <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah <EOS> you could maybe take out the l_c_d_ dis display even , <EOS> if it if it comes up on the computer itsel on the t_v_ itself . <EOS> yeah . yeah . <EOS> right . <EOS> so we may not need the l_c_d_ display ? <EOS>
well , that's the thing , <EOS> as <EOS> have we decided that we can only spend , uh , twenty five euro ? <EOS> i think that <EOS> well not spend , but you know , charge twenty five euro . <EOS> i i think we could use somehow the s coffee machine dialogue interface or so . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> what is this ? <EOS> this is in fact some other component <EOS> that are in between the electrical de the electronic device . <EOS> okay . <EOS> look . <EOS> but here what i wanted to emphasise it is just you know the bulb and . <EOS>
uh another point is the l_c_d_ screen . <EOS> um i don't know if that will rise the cost too much , <EOS> because <EOS> y i <EOS> um i think we'll have to choose between the docking station or the screen , <EOS> 'cause <EOS> yeah . <EOS> it will be too much as well . <EOS>
so um <EOS> i wan i wanna go through not not just addressing the um uh the the points that you made , sarah , <EOS> but um doing my presentation in the order i wrote it . <EOS> so first of all um i wanna talk about what possibilities we've got for the energy source . <EOS> um we can have your bog standard double double a_ batteries in a replaceable um little compartment . <EOS> we can have a hand <EOS> sorry <EOS> a wind-up , yeah , <EOS> which i think is quite an interesting concept for a sorry for a remote control , <EOS> but i it maybe is doesn't quite go with the um the fruit and veg . <EOS> um one that one that i think is quite interesting is the kinetic energy source , <EOS> where um you you actually get the energy by moving the device , <EOS> which is quite a ni a nice and neat one . <EOS> you have to <EOS> it means that if it's sitting there for a long time it probably won't work , <EOS> but you have to sort of throw it between your hands every now and then , <EOS> it'll work . <EOS> or we we had talked about solar power , <EOS> but i thing that we agreed that that's not so good in the dark . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> s <EOS> uh i wrote down some personal preferences about uh the remote control . <EOS> of course it is very handy if the remote control is hand held , <EOS> so you don't have to uh uh wind it up or something , <EOS> or just is it's it's very light to uh to make uh to use it . <EOS> uh i personally uh pref prefer that uh it would be p uh come available in the various colours , and uh easy to use buttons . <EOS> but i suppose that the one of the other team members uh uh thought of that uh too . <EOS> and it is possible for several designs and um easy to use b uh sorry , easy to use buttons . <EOS> perhaps soft touch , uh touch screen uh buttons <EOS> because uh the rubber buttons are always uh uh they uh slightly uh they can be slightly damaged , <EOS> uh so the numbers on the buttons are not possible uh to read anymore . <EOS> and uh well as i said uh before th uh we can uh make several designs . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so that's two , <EOS> so that's seven , yeah . <EOS> it's locatable ? <EOS> fabulous . <EOS> d_ . <EOS> yep . <EOS> intuitive , <EOS> completely intuitive . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> if uh uh if this means intuitive , if it means the way people kind of are used to finding things <EOS> and it's i th i think it's <EOS>
okay . <EOS> i think i think that will be revol revolutionary . <EOS> because all the t_v_ uh the the remote control have all numbers , lots of buttons <EOS> and then you dunno what to choose in the end . <EOS> yeah . alright . <EOS> yeah , yeah . so <EOS> i think for for the technical points we have to to to check how to gather the data from programme or contents and all this stuff <EOS>
it's like a b <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> right . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> well i mean if if you're gonna this for channels , right , then y wouldn't the volume need to be separate somehow ? <EOS> like you could just have <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i don't know , <EOS> you could click and then have it up and down , <EOS> but i think <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> okay . <EOS> and each can <EOS> it can respond for your voice , <EOS> like it can turn on the light for you just to f find it easily , <EOS> yeah ? <EOS> okay . <EOS> mm . <EOS> so basically that's it . <EOS> um i see that you target uh several s application not only t_v_ <EOS> but i like we talk about um universal uh remote control . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yep . <EOS> mm-hmm . mm-hmm . <EOS> yep . <EOS> mm . <EOS> mm . mm . <EOS> and then you have the option of having the different colours , different covers . <EOS> yes . <EOS> so so so that that would make the trends equal , <EOS> so we we we really have don't have , <EOS>
i will try to summarise it and put that summary in the shared folder if you want to look at it afterwards <EOS> so then uh each of you will uh lead a presentation on the task that has been required last time <EOS> so user requirement specification , technical function design and working design . <EOS> then i will uh present you some new project requirements i received from uh the management board . <EOS> then we will take uh the decision on on the remote control uh needed functions <EOS> and then i will assign you the task for the next part of the meeting . <EOS> of the of the process . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> it's d <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i think it's definitely got to be a a one-handed a one-handed job . <EOS> mm . <EOS> i feel like i'm just shooting everything down here . <EOS> uh um <EOS> that's fine . <EOS> you're the boss , <EOS> you're allowed to . <EOS>
three <EOS> so we are <EOS> i give it a four now . <EOS> six ? six ? <EOS> six , five , four . <EOS> six , five , four <EOS> six , so it's uh five point five , or less . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so <EOS> okay . <EOS>
i think we have to market it in the right way , that um to say that it is simplistic . <EOS> so people don't just see it and think , uh , this is so simplistic , i don't want to spend twenty five euros . <EOS> we have to market it . <EOS>
no no no <EOS> it's not <EOS> i think that's n that's not a problem <EOS> because you you don't have to wear a microphone . <EOS> it it just the microphone is embedded in the controller . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> but where is the controller ? <EOS> okay . <EOS>
alright . <EOS> so <EOS> that was it for me . <EOS> alright . <EOS> okay . <EOS> 'kay . <EOS> thanks . <EOS> uh <EOS> are you going to put the the notes on the <EOS> yeah , in the project folder . yeah . <EOS> i'm writing very fast . <EOS> hope it's readable . <EOS> okay <EOS> um anything more you want to add to the discussion ? <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> in fact i would propose another solution . <EOS> basically you use just four or five channels , <EOS> right ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so uh <EOS> set up your t_v_ set like channels that you use they're one , two , three and five , <EOS> and you will never have to go to a twenty fives channel . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> with the with the colours . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> no , uh , are the plates interchangeable ? <EOS> i think i missed a few <EOS> they are ? <EOS> so you can have banana and kiwi and <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay , so that's something that's kind of in the making too , <EOS> like maybe it'll become more <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> different . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> camera . <EOS> yeah . cool . <EOS> s underwater uh <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah submarine . <EOS> personally i think it's really ugly . <EOS> well <EOS> yeah . <EOS> just give me the thing that it's inside there <EOS> maybe i'm too old for this stuff . <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> but if it's like under covers or like in a couch you still can't see it . <EOS> it's really <EOS> would it be very difficult to um just have an external device <EOS> that like i dunno , you tape to your to your t_v_ <EOS> um that when you press it <EOS> you ha <EOS> a little light beep goes off ? <EOS> do you think that would be conceptually possible ? <EOS>
yeah . uh yeah <EOS> but but if you sell it in the market it's going to be cheap , actually . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> but w <EOS> but it's going to be cheap whatever though , <EOS> it was set with i <EOS> we've got a set price . <EOS>
sixty . <EOS> you p <EOS> oh . <EOS> no you press the plus first . <EOS> i i well it doesn't <EOS> we haven't really s <EOS> i would've thought you pressed the plus first and then the six five , <EOS> but she says plus press which <EOS> what do you think is simpler ? <EOS> it's a <EOS>
yes yes maybe maybe you can uh can just talk about it <EOS> or maybe you can use the whiteboard if necessary um . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> well <EOS> i've just been um presented with some research we've done in a small focus group <EOS> so , <EOS> a hundred people , just asked them about their remote control usage habits and what they want in a remote control . um . <EOS> it's <EOS> probably can't email this to you , <EOS> i've just got a web page with some data on it . <EOS> um basically it's saying that users generally dislike the look and feel of their remote controls . <EOS> um seventy five u seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly . um . <EOS>
uh yeah <EOS> i dunno . <EOS> they're my favourite pets . <EOS> you have some uh ? <EOS> uh i have colour already . <EOS> yeah <EOS> i'm not so good at drawing with this kind of <EOS> st <EOS> oh shit . um <EOS> the pen , <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
yeah yeah . <EOS> mm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> because you've got your general record anyway <EOS> so if you there's a programme on you want to put record on , that's fine , <EOS> but if you do want to tape something in two days time and you're not sure if you're going to , you put the number in <EOS> and it's just a number , <EOS> it's not a date , <EOS> it's not a time , <EOS> it's not a channel , <EOS> it's not when it finishes , <EOS> it's not anything like that , <EOS> it's just a number . <EOS>
um and i like my animal that looks nothing like a bear because um i dunno maybe because there's so many cartoon characters made up after the bear <EOS> like the jungle book characters and stuff like that . <EOS> great . <EOS> right . <EOS> hello . <EOS> um i'm gonna go for the dog , <EOS> and i'm gonna draw one badly as well . <EOS> uh . <EOS> looks like it's going to be a dachshund or something . <EOS>
w i think we were very creative . <EOS> no , i mea i think it means sort of individually . <EOS> oh right , okay . <EOS> yes , no , maybe ? <EOS> okay . groovy . <EOS> so uh we're just gonna . <EOS> uh yeah , okay . <EOS> teamwork ? <EOS> leadership , <EOS> sorry . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> okay . <EOS> an i s no , yeah . <EOS> i dunno if you see something else important or <EOS> okay these are the user requi <EOS> i'm just thinking of some thing . <EOS> um <EOS> mm . <EOS>
and we're a very environmentally friendly company , aren't we as well ? <EOS> yeah , <EOS> having a rechargeable stand , <EOS> so that not only it doubles as a stand , but um for using it as uh recharging it , but also for using it as sound recognition . <EOS>
well i sort of like having the a yellow strip at the bottom with the r_r_ like that . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> and that's at the bottom of it . <EOS> i think maybe we should do it on a b button itself though , <EOS> because if people are able to change the covers , <EOS> i don't know , <EOS> maybe the on-off button , something , some the menu button , <EOS> i don't know , <EOS> but you know if we're gonna put our company logo on there and somebody could just get <EOS>
yep . <EOS> yep . <EOS> too expensive , they're not gonna buy . <EOS> but , i think uh there's one other thing interesting two things that are interesting <EOS> is that uh from the fifteen to thirty-five year-old group , which always spends more money on trendy new things , speech recognition is requested . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> are we just about ready ? <EOS> apparently i'm supposed to use the whiteboard . <EOS> do we <EOS> um is it necessary ? <EOS> i don't think so . <EOS> it's <EOS> yeah the the marker thing kinda stopped working last time we <EOS> we'll just do um <EOS>
and so there <EOS> well <EOS> yeah <EOS> that's why <EOS> yeah . <EOS> that's how it works . <EOS> something i miss about my hometown . <EOS> i miss coffee . <EOS> burritos . <EOS> burritos <EOS> mm . <EOS> oh <EOS> nice . <EOS> that cost less than eight pounds . <EOS>
mm-hmm . yep . <EOS> i don't know really what the the price range for remote controls is . <EOS> are we gonna be at the very bottom of the price range , <EOS> or are we kind of middle to bottom ? <EOS> i don't know . <EOS> uh well
yeah . colour , size , sh <EOS> so you you think it's better if small than bigger . <EOS> yeah , maybe at least n not bigger than this i guess . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah , but without any extremes like n not of this size , not too large . okay . <EOS>
i think energy were batteries <EOS> and then uh and uh <EOS> yeah . <EOS> the docking station . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so that's the the the first point . <EOS> we already decided that on the previous meeting . <EOS> maybe it's better to to include rechargeable batteries <EOS> which you can recharge through the docking station . <EOS>
um probably a duck <EOS> i just i li i like the way they look <EOS> and they're just nice animals <EOS> and i like how they can fly or swim or walk around or whatever . <EOS> uh-huh . <EOS> right , <EOS> okay . <EOS> uh 's horses , <EOS> no particular reason why . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> if we if we add the time , we have to have maybe a bigger display or something like that , <EOS> and is it very useful ? <EOS> i mean , are users wants to have the time on the on the remote ? <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> with these new costings . so <EOS> just look at <EOS> forget that one and look at that one now . <EOS> yes . yes . yes . i th i th i think w we just go for this one <EOS> and that that now twelve euros is the
yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> then you lose it , yeah . <EOS> kind of um , maybe more like a p_d_a_ kind of , just hand held , <EOS> like , <EOS> 'cause <EOS> okay . <EOS> for for uh <EOS> remember we're trying to make it for twelve euros fifty . <EOS>
yes . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> okay , very good . <EOS> okay . <EOS> yes . <EOS> okay ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
so f <EOS> uh yeah . <EOS> yeah , i guess that's <EOS> mm . <EOS> true . <EOS> i know what you're saying and uh understand where you're coming from . <EOS> or well , <EOS> but like uh like more than just the battery , like a complete different like you've only got <EOS> like , you know like th uh <EOS> this bit's the bit you keep , <EOS> and this is the expensive bit , <EOS> this is like the chip <EOS> and this is the microphone . <EOS> and then this is the power source <EOS> and the bit everyone sees . <EOS> and then <EOS>
something like this . okay , you know <EOS> very artistic . <EOS> jurgen , you want to go next ? <EOS> yes . okay . <EOS> wha <EOS> thank you . <EOS> yeah ? <EOS> here you go . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> um <EOS> how did it work ? <EOS>
makes it a lot easier , <EOS> huh ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm . <EOS> so <EOS> yeah , then you can yeah . <EOS> requirements , <EOS> no ? <EOS> functions . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> then it should have uh on , off , <EOS> and uh <EOS>
mm . <EOS> um uh . file open . <EOS> 'kay . we go . <EOS> trend watching . <EOS> okay . <EOS> so uh to gather my research , two basic methods . <EOS> we compared uh whether people want the remote control to do a lot of stuff or they want it to look cool . <EOS> and then we we research uh fashion trends in europe , <EOS> what's what's the new black , <EOS> you know , <EOS> as it goes . <EOS> next slide please . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> um alright so c <EOS> is it function f_ eight ? <EOS> uh-huh . <EOS> hopefully appear in a wee second . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> come on . <EOS> i think it's working . <EOS> up there we go . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah that's why <EOS> yeah <EOS> that's why i think we have to keep that if it's possible . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i think it's it makes it both easy and both innos innovative . <EOS> so i think it's a good aspect and it should be kept . <EOS>
no , <EOS> we have we have <EOS> after lunch we have thirty minutes to ourselves to prepare , <EOS> so that's fine , <EOS> w before lunch we just have to complete the questionnaire and some sort of summary . <EOS> to prepare , <EOS> okay , yeah , that's good . <EOS> okay . <EOS>
yeah , yeah . <EOS> or like even <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> dif <EOS> or even like yeah like you said , like a joystick like that . <EOS> you know ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> like uh we could do <EOS> i'm trying to think of other sha like fruits that are oddly shaped . <EOS>
but you you can fit i you're saying now you can fit it to <EOS> yeah , well , this is actu this could be a genetically engineered fruit that's designed to be you know square so that it packs tighter in the boxes . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> okay . <EOS> corporate colour . <EOS> yellow . <EOS> i presume . <EOS> um , everything , all their sort of uh you know the uh corporate website and everything's yellow . <EOS> okay . <EOS> yellow . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> and the logo uh the sort of slogan we put the fa fashion in electronics uh <EOS> i don't know exactly how sort of incorpor <EOS> i mean , i guess if you're going for a sort of globular shape you could kind of have it working its way round it or something . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> yep . <EOS> just kinda stretch it over <EOS> okay , <EOS> good yeah . <EOS> and it'll just stay on <EOS> and then the buttons come through <EOS> and so and then the <EOS> each one of 'em on the very end will have the logo with the yellow circle and the r_r_ . <EOS>
oh i see i see . <EOS> is this one of the tests is to see how we can adapt to s changing situations in the in the meeting room ? <EOS> nah . <EOS> so what we had is we had the method . <EOS> that's not how you spell method , is it ? <EOS>
yeah , <EOS> uh that's a good call , <EOS> yeah . <EOS> well <EOS> we had the we had the data saying that old people will be less likely to pay extra money <EOS> but the funct the increased functionality , the e ease of use of the device might make up for that . <EOS>
yeah , one . <EOS> seven <EOS> or a seven . <EOS> there are how many sixes ? <EOS> one , two , three . <EOS> three . <EOS> no , wait , <EOS> a little bit under six . <EOS> no , wait . <EOS> so we've got four sevens , <EOS> so that's twenty eight , <EOS> three sixes , <EOS> eighteen . <EOS>
hmm . <EOS> so <EOS> y you just can't make a nice remote . <EOS> yeah , single curve . <EOS> because that was very important , <EOS> huh ? <EOS> it's too bad for the speaker . <EOS> so <EOS> it's curved , <EOS> it's still that <EOS> so <EOS> we we dropped the speech recognition together with the speaker . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> thanks for the reminder for five minutes to finish , thanks . <EOS> um the next thing that they wanted us to do was look at chip on print as a decision . <EOS> oh right , okay , <EOS> i'd <EOS> that that's something i maybe should have covered . <EOS> um chip on print is just a manufacturing technique <EOS> um and i would certainly recommend it , i think , <EOS> because i'm not sure i have an alternative . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> channel changing . <EOS> and maybe that spatially divides it , <EOS> so it's like if you're looki if you're trying to get the t_v_ on that's , you know , like the top thing on the remote , i dunno if d be vertical or horizontal in terms of how we're gonna make it , but if it's like all the t_v_ stuff was here , <EOS> then all the v_c_r_ stuff was here , <EOS> all the whatever else we have programmed into it it's all just in its separate place and not like all the on buttons together , <EOS> 'cause then you like , i don't even know what i'm turning on . <EOS>
is that being too generous ? <EOS> mm . i'd i'd i don't think fruit and veg is the sole criterion . is the sole criterion for being um fashion fashionable or inspired by current fashions . <EOS> um i'd g i'd rate i'd rate this fairly highly from that point of view actually . <EOS>
i d i wouldn't think so . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so that remains to s to be seen <EOS> but uh the target group as a whole is is basically everybody with a t_v_ . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> uh . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> that's <EOS> or if we should have a targeted re remote control . <EOS> okay . <EOS> so colour , robustness , easy to use , size , <EOS> yeah , size matters , yeah . <EOS> so , i think there's <EOS>
. <EOS> uh <EOS> hmm . hmm . <EOS> interesting . <EOS> yeah . why , why moving away from hand-held , why ? <EOS> what's the uh idea ? <EOS> just a thought . <EOS> well <EOS> if you don't need to pick it up it could kind of be a selling point . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> oh yes , <EOS> but there's no big difference between the traditional controller . <EOS> uh thi this <EOS> i mean , <EOS> the user is not only interested in having speech or gesture recognition <EOS> or <EOS> if he has something that works fine and is really fancy , looks nice and it's easy easy to use , easy to use . <EOS>
let's build it into a sponge . <EOS> elderly people like au colours which y are being seen in autumn like um woods um dark brown , red , deep reds and stuff . <EOS> they liked square shapes with round edges . <EOS> and hard materials like wood , um titanium . <EOS> they <EOS> those kind of materials they liked . <EOS> this is a bit like the young peoples like the fruity colours , innovative , all the colours you see , the blue , the red , the white , the yellow , that stuff . <EOS>
oh there it is . <EOS> yeah , okay great . <EOS> uh and i'm gonna write up our results on the board , <EOS> so this'll be a way for us to go through and decide if we're um sort of review where we stand with it . <EOS> okay , so um <EOS> so to sort of b bring together two things , sort of design goals and also the market research that we had , <EOS> uh when we rate this , one is v high in in succeeding or fitting to our original aim and seven is low , <EOS> okay . <EOS> so these i these i th are the <EOS> and um we've been asked to uh to collectively rate this , <EOS> so what we can do is try and just y work on a consensus system so <EOS>
very good . <EOS> okay . <EOS> but we still got a very different price for those two <EOS> so they're not really comparable yet anyway . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> we we must try to get them closer . <EOS> yeah , it's right , yeah that's right . <EOS>
artificial light , no . <EOS> that's going to <EOS> i know , <EOS> different parts of the world too , if we're if we're marketing internationally . <EOS> uh <EOS> but <EOS> yeah <EOS> and most people most people also watch t_v_ in the in the night anyway . <EOS>
sorry , <EOS> what is your ? <EOS> uh participant three . <EOS> you might have some background noise from the t_v_ which will make the speech recognition much uh harder , so . <EOS> yeah but you should be able to activate or disactivate , <EOS> so yeah yeah . <EOS> yeah <EOS> uh channel fifty . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> is there some some formula you're using that says you have to sum them up ? <EOS> uh no i didn't anything . <EOS> well just leave it at that then . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> oops . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> the uh <EOS> so maybe maybe w we can we should stick to general feeling . we can had uh have a out of these numbers , which which is that well we should go for it . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> uh i was working on a s yeah on a schedule , and i was supposed to do it like this . <EOS> but um yeah then uh the information came and it was kind of exact with all the steps in the remote control that i had to follow , so i was trying to organise them for myself . <EOS> and then make the <EOS> the design , a the actual design , <EOS> but i never came around to do that . <EOS> so i'm not really sure what i'm supposed to say about it . <EOS>
sixteen point three . <EOS> oh , <EOS> okay , indeed . <EOS> so <EOS> we don't <EOS> yeah , <EOS> we also have to <EOS> so <EOS> we still <EOS> is it possible to make <EOS> could could we do it on a regular chip on print or something ? <EOS>
no it's just different . <EOS> but we i we will need a receiver , an antenna . <EOS> integrated , yeah . <EOS> so it's just uh i i think that's <EOS> yeah . <EOS> it should be a really simple signal though so <EOS> i know personally that would be a very attractive feature , is to have a uh have a button i can push to find my remote control . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> the most important things on a f on an on an uh remote control are channel selection , volume con selection , <EOS> i think . <EOS> and <EOS> yeah . <EOS> and power s power usage . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> and a teletext , but that is not of the question . <EOS> other things are <EOS>
uh so yeah , they they also give the uh <EOS> they they suggested the idea of using a spinning wheel like you use on the side of an m_p_ three player like ipod . <EOS> um so we've already addressed that <EOS> and i think that would actually be worse for something like r_s_i_ <EOS> i mean you got that thumb movement that you're constantly doing . <EOS> um the other suggestion , <EOS> and i i have a feeling that <EOS>
mm 'kay . <EOS> mm 'kay ? <EOS> i'm rose <EOS> and i'm project manager , from california . <EOS> um . hmm . <EOS> s <EOS> oh , <EOS> a cat . <EOS> it's definitely significantly harder once you are doing it . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> um it's actually a coyote . <EOS> let's see . let's see , <EOS> let's give it a little bit of a snout , i don't know , some teeth . <EOS>
yeah , re yeah , regular . yeah , okay . yeah , regular . <EOS> okay . <EOS> i think i'll just check it . <EOS> and we need a plastic case , with a scroll wheel . <EOS> yes . <EOS> that's pretty much it . <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
even from my perspective seven t seven centimetres by seven centimetres is still <EOS> yeah , but we wanted the big buttons and stuff like that , you know . <EOS> is it <EOS> can you hold that , or ? <EOS> because if it's t too small we can we can lose it , at home , you know . <EOS>
know , five , ten years . <EOS> by which time i mean when all's said and done , the digital television will be taking over in that time scale . um <EOS> mm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> uh uh p perhaps we should , know , reduce the uh , you know , the sort of moving parts even more by not even having a battery compartment <EOS> and uh <EOS>
that was generally how helpful that was . <EOS> um , then we considered some design options with how it should look , <EOS> um , we discussed an ipod-like button system <EOS> which , uh , we haven't concluded but we're <EOS> right , um <EOS> so , if you all have presentations to do , we can see what where you've come from our last time . <EOS> does everyone have presentations ? <EOS>
okay . <EOS> mm . <EOS> extra . <EOS> yeah , okay . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah , but i expected also the wheel would be cheap but you tell me that it is very expensive so , <EOS> yeah . <EOS> first of all i was thinking to have a a continuous light <EOS> and you w when t you you you you press the on button you have the light on your remote control , when you want to turn off your device <EOS>
um that's , <EOS> we've uh got to design a um remote which is only suitable for t_v_ . <EOS> um that's because uh it will be too complex <EOS> and the time to market will be too big , if we wanna have it uh for more functions . <EOS>
sued the beatles so <EOS> okay , we'll make it a uh pomegranate , a big pomegranate . <EOS> well , okay , it seems like the only thing that we haven't really finally um agreed on is its image . <EOS> . <EOS> like , yeah , we're we're saying no we don't want it to be fruit and vegetables , but we dunno what it should be , <EOS> or like are we going yeah it looks slick , but what do what do we mean by slick sort of thing ? <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> um , okay so i think well , this sets a bit uh the stage . <EOS> uh could we try so could you try please to uh <EOS> do you want an extra uh piece of paper ? <EOS> maybe try to , well , think on your own and then talk a little bit just to the people around you . <EOS>
these pens are are neat though . <EOS> yeah , these are new ideas , like glow-in-the-dark or something like that . <EOS> we discussed all the new ideas , <EOS> but of course we couldn't reach any proper goals , we couldn't use these , <EOS> but we h we are using these scroll buttons like this . <EOS> these are new ideas we and new shapes , everything <EOS> . at le <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> so <EOS> opening . <EOS> um these are our minutes from r the functional design . <EOS> we decided our target group is the focus on who can afford it , <EOS> because we have international appeal <EOS> and we said it's for all age groups , different um functions of it . <EOS> our main objectives were simplicity and fashion . <EOS> and s um <EOS> in <EOS> specific functions are something to keep the remote from getting lost , large buttons for the essential functions , a possibility for extra functions , like a sliding a sliding piece and a long-life battery or a charging station . <EOS> okay , <EOS> now three presentations . <EOS> i'd like to do it in this order , first do the conceptual specification of components , properties and materials um and then the conceptual specification of user interface and finally trend watching . <EOS>
yes . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> we're wicked . awesome . <EOS> okay so <EOS> we're on to the <EOS> s 's kind of s frighteningly accurate . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> we're on to the pat-on-the-back part of the presentation , <EOS> where we have a look at the criterias th that paul the criterion criteria that paul has has given us , and we can use that to tell how's it going ? <EOS> anyone got any thoughts ? <EOS> how how have we done today ? <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> so we need to close the meeting . <EOS> uh we'll have a new meeting soon <EOS> and uh so the work every every of you ha have t d to do . <EOS> so um you have to work on the on the working design , <EOS> you have to uh work on the technical functions , <EOS> and uh you have to work on us user requirements specs , <EOS> alright ? <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> and um , well , <EOS> my conclusion is uh is uh less is more , <EOS> keep it simple . <EOS> so uh <EOS> maybe we should just ease down on the functionality to uh to keep it accessible <EOS> on t <EOS> because you all know , if there are a lot of function on the the television , <EOS> some you you'll never know <EOS> uh and never use , <EOS> and therefore it's uh important <EOS> if you want to change the volume or channel that is always accessible and easy <EOS> and other functions um that are not so important um well you we should consider just not using them <EOS> or at least putting them somewhere on the remote where they're not in the way for the for the most important functions . <EOS>
i just don't know what it is , <EOS> but <EOS> i think there are some of those like infomercial remotes that have things so you won't lose them . <EOS> mm . <EOS> i dunno . i mean <EOS> we were talking about it and like i in my household at least , there's only about two places that the remote is ever <EOS> 'cause there's only one t_v_ <EOS> and <EOS>
we didn't we didn't use the whiteboard that much . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> no . <EOS> although i don't see how we could have very l at least for me <EOS> no . <EOS> i <EOS> yeah . <EOS> if i'd gotten pictures of the different parts of the case , the different looks of the case , i would have probably drawn them up , <EOS> but <EOS>
i don't know . <EOS> i think w <EOS> well <EOS> i think when we go on to the une userface , we're gonna have to decide the interface we're gonna have to decide um whether we're gonna have a scroll or not . <EOS> okay . <EOS> well , <EOS> let's think about that while we talk about the case . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> yeah <EOS> it's uh <EOS> yeah we we can give a preference to them , <EOS> but it is <EOS> but with plastic or the rubber or whatever it is it's much better with that rather than going for <EOS> do do you agree ? <EOS>
that's sort of curve in and out . <EOS> is i <EOS> mm . <EOS> 'cause this is single curve , <EOS> this is curved on both sides . <EOS> so double-curve . <EOS> no , <EOS> i think it means double curved as in um <EOS> like uh a single curve on that bottom half , and the double curved would be if it was that similar curve upward . <EOS> okay , i might be wrong though . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> no . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so that'll be in <EOS> but the but that's relying on the television market changing to an automatic <EOS> and if it is at the moment , that's fine . <EOS> but at the moment it's not , <EOS> so it seems to me that you have to have a device that caters , <EOS> 'cause otherwise it would make it uh your device would become inoperable , or only operable in certain circumstances <EOS> and the idea is to have an international market <EOS> which is <EOS> and it's also m it's <EOS> the the product we've got is something that's at the i would have said the lower end of the s of the cost scale , <EOS> so we're not really going for something that's uh terribly high-tech . <EOS>
i think it will be better if we have all these modules in the same remote control , <EOS> because maybe parents will lose these uh <EOS> yeah , <EOS> but i mean if you have an add-ons , the kids may just uh hide the parental module <EOS> and so that their parents can't use it . <EOS>
right . <EOS> well , if you have the base , you could start putting in a charger and then you have a different kind of battery . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> rechargeable batteries are cheaper usually . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> i i think we can make a decision about that later . <EOS> uh we'll still put that as a point that we need to discuss . <EOS> so that would include battery source <EOS> power source rather . <EOS> is it going to have a charger , or is it going to be run strictly off batteries ? <EOS> and we also need to deal with the issue you mentioned of speech recognition , if we want that . <EOS>
hmm . <EOS> that's alright . <EOS> right . <EOS> cool . um okay , <EOS> so these are my personal preferences . <EOS> so you have sleek , stylish , sophisticated , you know , <EOS> so something that's , you know , a bit cool . <EOS> um you know , functional , so it's useful , but minimalist . <EOS> um there's a there's an important thing that , you know , people use when , you know , when you're filling up your home , you know , a lot of people fill up their home with bits of crap , basically , you know , <EOS> and you've got all this stuff , and you're just like , what the hell is that , who is ever gonna use it ? you know , <EOS> so things should either be functional or beautiful or preferably both , <EOS> so i think we need to aim for both . <EOS> um okay , then a long battery life , like you were talking about earlier <EOS> and um , you know , i was thinking that solar power would be quite cool <EOS> because , you know , your remote control just sits there , <EOS> and you could just sit it in the sunshine <EOS> and save the environment a bit . <EOS> um and then like a locator , <EOS> so you know , kind of like you have for a mobile phone or <EOS> not a mobile phone <EOS>
right . right . <EOS> okay , and what kind of chip would we need for this guy ? <EOS> how complicated <EOS> are we gonna go with the voice activated <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i don't think we should do voice , <EOS> i think we should just do um the recognition for when it's lost , you know . <EOS> could we <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
to navigate yeah . <EOS> that's right , that's right . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> with the wheel it's easy . <EOS> how man <EOS> well then you can you you have like a little uh number selection thing , <EOS> you press the the the teletext button uh to move between uh the fields <EOS> and then you can just scroll the number back and forth so you have s you go you scroll to seven and then zero zero and then you can uh <EOS>
video and ts hi-fi and stuff . <EOS> maybe you <EOS> yeah <EOS> now th that's the other thing is it's gotta be cheap . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> 'cause i i i mean i was thinking something that's got different like maybe a a an l_c_d_ display on it that's got different pages for different devices , <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> okay . <EOS> array of switches <EOS> which i'll speak about in the next bit <EOS> so that <EOS> okay . <EOS> and then to uh yeah , <EOS> so to conserve battery life the remote should be in a standby mode no while not being used . <EOS> now what i was thinking about that was 'cause sometimes when y when you have these things , they've got little lights on behind the buttons , so you can see what all the buttons are , <EOS> like on a mobile phone , they do it more often than on a than on a t_v_ remote , <EOS> but you could you could have lights behind the buttons <EOS> and um after like five or ten seconds of not being used i'd have that turned off , <EOS> if we decided to go for buttons that could light up . <EOS>
i have slides . <EOS> okay . <EOS> ah , <EOS> effectively one slide <EOS> and maybe we can discuss everything . <EOS> product prod <EOS> what slides ? <EOS> yep . <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> so , this is our product or prototype . <EOS> this is made by clay . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> so , thank you . <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> thank you . <EOS> thank you very much . <EOS> okay . <EOS> watch i i have my cord behind you here . <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> i always get it on here , but getting it off is <EOS>
small too . <EOS> alright , <EOS> we also said simplicity , <EOS> how w how well does it address just being simple ? <EOS> simple to use or simple in design ? do you know ? <EOS> i think overall , <EOS> 'cause we had said before our two main things were simplicity and fashion , <EOS> so those are the next two things we're gonna look at . <EOS> separate from fancy , like that sort of thing . <EOS>
beg your pardon ? <EOS> you always have a print plate , <EOS> right ? <EOS> always , <EOS> so <EOS> yeah sure , of course , yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> i dunno what w what we have to decide about that . <EOS> yeah well <EOS> it's a good question . <EOS> it just was in there <EOS> and i didn't have any information about it , <EOS> but <EOS>
i think we should . <EOS> like i think that would be in a as in like in for the design , <EOS> sorry , um . <EOS> i think we should definitely go with buttons that don't look like a normal remote , <EOS> 'cause most remotes have small square buttons , <EOS> i think we should do something like maybe bigger and round like bubbles . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> have i misunderstood you ? <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> 'kay . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> i think it would be good to have a contrast between , if the whole thing is gonna be this rubber thing it would be good to open it up and see something quite fancy looking inside . <EOS> now how would you distinguish , if you had it bare , how would you distinguish where you had to press , i mean <EOS>
okay . <EOS> brilliant . <EOS> right . <EOS> uh we did , yeah . <EOS> this cost <EOS> well <EOS> to put this into um production , we're looking at about <EOS> what was our goal ? <EOS> it was twelve fifty euro <EOS> um and this actually came in at about eleven ninety nine . <EOS>
uh <EOS> uh well <EOS> i think uh elderly people just like to have everything in place . <EOS> and i don't think they they like uh remotes just laying everywhere in their rooms . <EOS> so maybe a docking station will help them give the remote a place . <EOS>
yeah <EOS> and the conceptual and functional . <EOS> like we were very creative in in coming up with an idea i guess , but m <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> well we were just limited by resources really <EOS> and like if we had decided to use the l_c_d_ screen , and like solar power backup and everything , then we wouldn't have been able to afford that . <EOS> so that did limit <EOS>
yeah , <EOS> i think we n we need to <EOS> they're both yellow with black buttons , <EOS> it's just that we didn't have any more dough to represent uh that , <EOS> but if you can just imagine banana shape with these bits as black . <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
but do you need the buttons for one to zero . <EOS> maybe c we can <EOS> nah . <EOS> uh <EOS> think if you're gonna include teletext you do . <EOS> i think many people like to use that . <EOS> 'cause if you should , if you want to switch from channel one to like thirty five , you don't wanna push the next channel button thirty five times . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> so <EOS> a separate button for for text , <EOS> okay . <EOS> in a separate button , yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> perhaps we should use the teletext sign <EOS> in p yeah . <EOS> a sign , yeah , <EOS> just like <EOS> okay , indeed . <EOS> okay , <EOS> we can uh modify that later . <EOS> okay . <EOS> would you like to make any comments about next uh <EOS>
yep . <EOS> yep . gonna have that on the side , aren't we , <EOS> like there or something ? <EOS> huh . <EOS> and um it's within budget , yep . <EOS> it is , isn't it ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay , <EOS> so we can say then that uh out of a possible <EOS> or what would be our goal here ? <EOS>
okay <EOS> here here's just two pictures of remote controls . <EOS> they're just simple t_v_ remote controls . <EOS> but one is uh user-centred . <EOS> that is the one on the left . <EOS> and you can straight away see there's less buttons . <EOS> and the other one is engineer-centred <EOS> where that's more uh specified for the sort of the elaborate piece of equipment it's trying to control um <EOS> which appeals more to the product that we want , <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> don't know the cost . <EOS> didn't have enough data to actually <EOS> does anyone have costs on the on the web ? <EOS> all it said was it gave sort of relative , some chips are more expensive than others , sort of things . <EOS> it didn't give me any actual cost . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> mm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> channels that way instead of <EOS> mm . <EOS> right , so <EOS> i've got a message to say five minutes , <EOS> i dunno how long ago that appeared . <EOS> um 'cause we're we're getting <EOS> um right , so <EOS> i'd i need to sum up very quickly here um . <EOS> we're looking at extreme simplicity . <EOS>
say it's more <EOS> eight <EOS> three . <EOS> medium , <EOS> but going towards a little bit higher than medium kind of thing . <EOS> yep . <EOS> okay , <EOS> three ? <EOS> yeah about three , okay . <EOS> okay , um <EOS> style reflects a fruit inspired colour , design . <EOS> i shouldn't have said colour , but just <EOS>
yeah the universal ones . yeah . <EOS> mm . <EOS> but but to sell it for twenty five you need a lot of neat features . for sure . <EOS> slim . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , yeah . <EOS> uh 'cause i mean , what uh twenty five euros , that's about i dunno , fifteen pounds or so ? <EOS>
okay s <EOS> so we just buy a circuit board and <EOS> okay . <EOS> exactly . <EOS> but i'm not sure about the circuit which is responsible for speech recognition . <EOS> this i prefer that we should make ourselves . <EOS> okay . <EOS> but it depends whether we take a decision to use it . <EOS> same thing . <EOS> it's fairly expensive to use these circuits . <EOS> so , speech recognition <EOS> well , l_c_d_ it's okay because it's common nowadays to use l_c_d_ , <EOS> so i agree on using any kind of l_c_d_ , <EOS> less buttons good for me as a as a designer of the circuit . <EOS> but the speech recognition we have to compare whether the price and the what does it offer , you know . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> could you use perhaps uh one button for multiple functions , <EOS> like example pressing it in longer makes it switch to an different function for example . <EOS> yeah , perhaps . <EOS> just for the minor functions perhaps . <EOS> thank you . <EOS> yeah , ma perhaps , <EOS> just just an idea . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so volume could be like the top it and the bottom <EOS> so do you need to <EOS> okay . <EOS> doesn't it rotate though , <EOS> so it'll be moving around . <EOS> well y you have to you have to like be able to change the function of it to like <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> the weight and feel . <EOS> weight , the feel of the product , but <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> we're getting used to that . <EOS> it's not quite like trying on a shoe , <EOS> but people are getting used to buying things online that they can't touch before buying . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> let's see . <EOS> mm . oh good . <EOS> oh . yes . <EOS> is it gonna work ? <EOS> yeah , <EOS> it's thinking about it . <EOS> mm yeah , <EOS> it'll get there . <EOS> yep . <EOS> okay . okay , <EOS> so i did some research on the internet <EOS> and um <EOS> what <EOS> you know , <EOS> the interf user interface are just aspects that are seen by users , <EOS> um commands and mechanisms for the operation , <EOS> and there're just kind of a variety of choices . <EOS> um findings , <EOS> so <EOS> a lot of times they tend to look cluttered <EOS> and these were just a couple examples of um different kinds that are a little bit more unusual . <EOS> there're some special ones available , like this one right here , <EOS> which is marketed towards children , um different designs , <EOS> and one of the things that n we need to watch out for is a v_ in volume <EOS> because people some <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> that's true . <EOS> it's not a step backwards . <EOS> five ? <EOS> six ? <EOS> mm-hmm . i'd s i i'd give it a six , to be honest . <EOS> six , . <EOS> yeah , okay let's give it a six . <EOS> okay , <EOS> that's totally thrown everything off balance . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> i'll explain myself here now <EOS> in the sense that uh in a <EOS> in the recent surveys , uh from the ages fr from fifteen to thirty-five , eighty percent are willing to spend more money for something as fancy as trendy . <EOS> twenty-five euros , uh that's that's a preson reasonable price . <EOS> that's a market price right now . <EOS> now if we're gonna take a risk , and push this up a bit , make it more expensive , <EOS> but give them added things that they don't have now , <EOS> then it w it could possibly sell . <EOS> obviously the risk is there . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so , the key layout and design are really crucial . <EOS> you don't want uh <EOS> you want people to be able to quickly access the buttons that they use a lot without uh always pressing the wrong one um . <EOS> and i didn't mention that we need a power button in our last <EOS> i can give you an example here of uh , good layout and bad layout <EOS>
yeah , <EOS> it should be in standby mode , <EOS> but <EOS> yeah a yeah . <EOS> i don't know whether it's handy to have a n a normal on button , a r just uh rubber uh for for t_v_ , <EOS> so you can turn it on <EOS> and then you can choose the channel . <EOS> otherwise you i don't know whether or not that's <EOS>
so um nice to see you again . <EOS> uh . so , uh . <EOS> tod uh for this meeting i will take the notes and do the minutes . <EOS> uh so we will see our three presentations . <EOS> um we will start with the uh manager expert wi who will talk about uh user re requirements , whats user needs and what it desire for this devi device . <EOS>
i think it's um um a multiple uh chip design um <EOS> and it's uh maybe printed on to the circuit board . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> uh i could find out more about that uh before the next fi next meeting . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> is it means it's on the yeah <EOS> is it on a micro-proc micro-processor based or uh <EOS>
so i just want you <EOS> yeah , we just made it . <EOS> so we can do the project evalu evaluation now for uh for everything together . <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> we can do some discussion about this . <EOS> was there room for creativity ? <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> thumb-shaped . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> and then the last thing is just that it'll be black labelling on top , <EOS> just which we didn't do . <EOS> okay . <EOS> and did you determine um the curvature of the bottom part of it for the hand , is it gonna be a single or a double ? <EOS>
so i think <EOS> yeah , colours . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> unfortunately they don't have silver fruits and vegetables . <EOS> i do i dunno . <EOS> um <EOS> i mean how are you how are you all envisioning by what we've just the feedback we've just got about the <EOS>
right . <EOS> which will probably just usurp what i said <EOS> so <EOS> so you want me to look at shapes and everything you said ? <EOS> shapes and colours and um basically how to make it attractive . <EOS> yep . okay . <EOS> uh . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS>
uh-huh . <EOS> i would say that's ex excellent in terms of uh ho how much we adhere to the ideals of the uh market place . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> and the the only false one is because we've chosen to keep a simple old technology , <EOS> to maintain old technology , <EOS> exactly . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> right . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> it was to the like seven universities or something . <EOS> partitioned off and stuff , <EOS> yeah <EOS> that was him . <EOS> you guys ready to celebrate ? <EOS> yeah <EOS> that's our last step . celebration . <EOS> apparently , does that include like champagne or something exciting ? <EOS>
one , yeah . <EOS> uh one is means highest ranking , <EOS> okay . <EOS> but i think highest ranking is seven , <EOS> or one ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> no it's it's like true is one end , and false is the oth <EOS> no that's false . <EOS>
i think it looks a lot more fancy if you use uh if you don't have any buttons on the s on on remote control . <EOS> yeah , i think so too . <EOS> otherwise y wet e k yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> yep . <EOS> basically the idea is to send a message to the t_v_ set , <EOS> as mael has pointed , <EOS> and it will be decoded by the t_v_ <EOS> and usually we it is easier to have uh keys or buttons <EOS> with which people can uh press <EOS> and then um changing a button will basically uh change the message which is being sent to the t_v_ <EOS> and uh um <EOS> a and basically it sends an internal signal <EOS> and decoded by the receiver . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> but do we have to write uh to write down uh the our stuff now ? or first lunchbreak ? <EOS> because i <EOS> no i th believe there's first lunch break . <EOS> i've everything in my head now so <EOS> yeah . <EOS> or you can just <EOS>
yep . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> why ? <EOS> huh <EOS> i think it was the real . <EOS> hey . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> definitely when when i first filled out the questionnaire i was marking it probably higher in terms of how much i had to how much i stressed over it <EOS> and then by the time i got to the last one i was like , you know , not very much . <EOS>
e_i_e_ . <EOS> i_e_ e_i_e_ , okay . <EOS> thank you . <EOS> okay , um <EOS> i wanted to explain the working design of the remote control . <EOS> it's possibly very handy if you want to uh design one of those . um well so <EOS> it basically works uh as i uh uh r wrote down uh in this uh little uh summary . <EOS> uh when you press a button , uh that's when you do pr for example when you uh want to turn up the volume , um a little connection is made <EOS> uh the the rubber uh button just presses on a <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> mm . but we can't really design for something that hasn't been invented yet . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> ah <EOS> it's it's it's it's coming up , actually . the personal video recorder and all those things it is coming up . <EOS> mm , well uh <EOS> i i think <EOS>
yeah <EOS> because it has to uh b <EOS> yeah <EOS> but it the the remote control has to know whether you're in a settings menu or just uh you just want to turn up the volume . <EOS> yeah , okay , true true . true . <EOS> so it has to have some kind of a calculation unit or c_p_u_ <EOS> to know uh in which state you are <EOS> and uh which button you are pressing in at the right moment . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> um so simple movements like pushing buttons would recharge the battery . <EOS> or a solar battery , <EOS> although there are slight um complications with solar batteries <EOS> as in we can't use a latex case if we have a solar battery . <EOS> hmm . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> we probably leave that . <EOS> i mean i guess one takes care of the other , <EOS> like um if you can yeah if you can call it then it's <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> then it can live anywhere . <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay , thanks . <EOS> you want to go ? <EOS> yep . <EOS> so yeah . <EOS> so most of the things which we are discussing about is speech recognition uh , <EOS> that means on my own i <EOS> yeah , it should be . <EOS>
it looks cool . <EOS> looks cool though . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> uh functional . <EOS> sorry , <EOS> that doesn't look anything like what you had there . <EOS> um so <EOS> it's up and down , <EOS> you hold it this way . <EOS> course then it's it's like the rectangular again , only with a couple of jutting out points . <EOS> but it's one-handed um . <EOS>
yep that's it . <EOS> presented by name . <EOS> my name is . <EOS> jose he man is . <EOS> your name is name ? <EOS> my name is name . <EOS> huh hi name . <EOS> my name is inigo montoya . <EOS> you killed my father . <EOS> prepare to die . <EOS>
okay , so let's break it up there . <EOS> 'kay . <EOS> okay ? <EOS> so , see you in half an hour . <EOS> okay . <EOS> do we go back to our room ? yep ? <EOS> i think so , yeah . <EOS> mm , yeah . <EOS>
because when you put your f <EOS> yeah <EOS> but if yo if you make the the l_c_d_ screen as large as the remote control itself , uh you'll you'll always get some <EOS> you <EOS> yeah . <EOS> going to be very greasy and stuff . <EOS> you always touch it , <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> these are the things we identified as being important . <EOS> um the three things were look and feel , innovation and ease of use , were the three important components <EOS> um appealing to the correct demographic so using those things in the right way to appeal to our demographic . <EOS> and then goin following the company motto , following the fashion trends and putting that into the product as well . <EOS>
yeah . we have to ask <EOS> yeah . we have to ask the quest of that's uh design to the uh industrial um designer . <EOS> yeah . yeah . <EOS> yeah . yeah <EOS> which is you . <EOS> okay so try to find that for next meeting . <EOS>
no i know . <EOS> i'm <EOS> yeah . <EOS> incom <EOS> well <EOS> heads are gonna roll , believe me . <EOS> have a <EOS> we have a list of employees that you would like fired . <EOS> yes yes . <EOS> okay . <EOS> n new ideas found ? <EOS> um <EOS>
sure . yep . <EOS> okay , sure . <EOS> yep . <EOS> yeah , it's good <EOS> well it's good to get ideas out while they're fresh in mind . <EOS> um <EOS> not <EOS> yeah . <EOS> and not losing . <EOS> and also it helps in terms of people not losing this , <EOS> you know they they're saying oh it's i lose it in the couch . <EOS> like we're kind of what we're b sort of getting in into here is mating different uh design features together <EOS> that they <EOS>
well they <EOS> o otherwise <EOS> maybe li like that . <EOS> yeah , like this colour this colour <EOS> maybe , you know , <EOS> maybe like still in the shape of a banana . <EOS> roughly . <EOS> no , exactly . <EOS> exactly . <EOS> um , but you know , just maybe maybe not exactly the same texture as a banana <EOS> and just kind of , you know <EOS> because the thing is it's gonna be a little bit difficult to make um to give like the texture of a banana anyway and to k to have the exact shape . <EOS> i think if you're gonna not be able to do it properly you may as well do it in a stylised way that just looks a bit more kind of , you know , twenty first century rather than sixties or seventies . <EOS>
mechanism . <EOS> it's it's it means when you when you sell this controller in china it's can recognise chinese . <EOS> it's r if you sell this controller in france it can recognise french . <EOS> it's a very smart , it's a very smart controller maybe <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
and and we're gonna make it we're gonna win mind-share by uh either being a fantastic product <EOS> or for it working , it just being good , reasonable-priced , and solid . <EOS> so if we can make if we can put an emphasis here on it not breaking i think that's in itself an extremely big thing . <EOS>
yeah i think so . <EOS> but um i did have one thing from a previous meeting , <EOS> you were talking about um being able to find the remote control <EOS> and i was talking about extendin being able to extend the remote control by having you know , a base station that can control other things as well . <EOS> it might be useful to have some kind of base station , <EOS> even if it's just you press on a button on it and uh and the remote control starts beeping , you know , this is a way of finding the remote . <EOS>
yeah , sure . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> uh thanks . <EOS> i wonder . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> after a cat , a turtle and a dog . <EOS> i think he's gonna draw an elephant . <EOS> i figure i should do something like that , <EOS> but i'm gonna do something much more difficult . <EOS>
okay . well . <EOS> oh sorry , <EOS> i'm i'm interrupting you . <EOS> are you is it <EOS> yeah ? <EOS> okay . right . um , right <EOS> we can probably skip that for now . <EOS> so , <EOS> we've had some stuff put forward , um <EOS> along with the new user requirements , <EOS> um we've had a lot of kind of input i'd say so far .
okay . <EOS> . <EOS> right . <EOS> okay . <EOS> alright . <EOS> is everyone here ? <EOS> okay . <EOS> this is our conceptual design meeting . <EOS> yep . <EOS> yep . <EOS> and <EOS> i'll just take a few minutes and uh go through the previous minutes . <EOS> um then each of you will have your presentation , <EOS> um and then we will need to make a decision on the concept for the remote control . <EOS> and then we'll have uh forty minutes for finishing up . <EOS> um <EOS> i'll go through the mee through the minutes first . <EOS> um , we just refreshed our our uh goal of making the finest remote control available . <EOS> um we decided that , or we know that we need to use company colours , company logo . <EOS> um and <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> just a suggestion . <EOS> with only one hand ? <EOS> these are not our target people . <EOS> okay . <EOS> what about people without hand ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah i think it's good . <EOS> mm uh okay . <EOS> but it's a good feature i guess yeah <EOS> we need to think about more how to incorporate it . <EOS>
a standard . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> um yes <EOS> but but i do <EOS> maybe you can give a hand to us <EOS> because i i'm not sure whether that that we can implement that for twelve euro and fifty cents . <EOS> i'm sorry to have so <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
uh yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> an alternate package . <EOS> yeah . okay . <EOS> okay ? <EOS> so now i understand it's lunch break . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> and um . <EOS> so that's what we will do . <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> so hank you very much . <EOS>
yeah , <EOS> and it has a a clear top and bottom so y so you could say , you know , it transmits from this end . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , why the hell not . <EOS> let's <EOS> that'll make us fifty million euros . <EOS> i don't know . <EOS> what do you guy what do you think ? <EOS>
the prototype discussion . <EOS> the prototype yeah . <EOS> do you need a this ? <EOS> no . <EOS> okay . <EOS> can try to plug that in there <EOS> but <EOS> there is our remo the banana . <EOS> um yeah <EOS> basically we we st went with the colour yellow . <EOS> um working on the principle of a fruit which was mentioned , it's basically designed around a banana . <EOS> um but it would be held in such a fashion , <EOS> where it is , <EOS> obviously it wouldn't be that floppy 'cause this would be hard plastic . <EOS>
s <EOS> like s uh you you you say we can use speech . <EOS> you can use uh well for example anything . <EOS> the the idea of using speech to reduce the button , but uh and it's more natural . yeah . <EOS> i <EOS> i think if you want t to choose uh from a list of programme or or something like that you you may have to to use uh w uh i dunno <EOS>
um but first of all we i'd like to uh introduce you to this room . <EOS> um as you probably have noticed there are little black uh fields on the table . <EOS> um you have to put your laptop exactly in that field <EOS> so the little cameras can see your face . <EOS> um there are cameras <EOS>
mm 'kay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> um i'll give it a one . <EOS> pretty hard to mess up . <EOS> i'll say one . <EOS> uh let's say two . <EOS> alright . <EOS> um we next wanna see if it has a spongy quality <EOS> and if indeed it's made of latex or rubber i it's spongy all the way . <EOS>
the other buttons and on here the top . <EOS> the options and then you have something like uh the p_ over here , <EOS> yeah . <EOS> but i think i wou <EOS> and the sound . <EOS> i think that's a matter of what you're used to . <EOS> i think i would put a plus and a min uh here . <EOS> and then the p_ in the mid in the middle <EOS> and the sound uh in the middle . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> alright . <EOS> often . <EOS> by the way my t_v_ doesn't have an equ equaliser but <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah i mean w we can't <EOS> my my t_v_ has , <EOS> but we we can leave them uh away . <EOS> uh most relevant , uh most used functions , <EOS> uh they speak for themselves i guess . <EOS> uh power button , uh channel , volume selection . <EOS> uh teletext <EOS> but we can skip that because i saw the newsflash , and teletext is so outdated that it it's i should not be used uh any more in the future . <EOS> so forget this one . <EOS> uh channel settings , so for programming uh your channels in in the right order . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> uh . <EOS> the <EOS> the angle you have to use . <EOS> perhaps that you have a lot of road remotes r road con remote controls . <EOS> yes , <EOS> perhaps you can integrate them or something . <EOS> you had different remote controls for different devices . <EOS> yes . <EOS>
ah yeah parameter okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay <EOS> and and voice command did you uh <EOS> voice command w we could specify anything . <EOS> we could assign any button a command to any button , if we have enough processing power , <EOS> i guess so . <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
and th those young people , yeah . y you saw it in my marketing report , they like the new fancy stuff , <EOS> so <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> they like the fancy stuff , yeah . that's true . <EOS> a touch screen , like microsoft al already developed something like that for uh uh multi-media applications . <EOS>
dunno . <EOS> okay maybe . <EOS> my goodness . <EOS> still feels quite primitive . <EOS> maybe like a touch screen or something ? <EOS> something like that , yeah . <EOS> or whatever would be technologically reasonable . <EOS> okay . <EOS> uh-huh , okay . <EOS> well i guess that's up to our industrial designer . <EOS>
as soon as you thought to move the the remote control you have the light . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> but you need another sensor for that , right ? <EOS> yeah . again . <EOS> yeah <EOS> no it's too expensive . <EOS> i don't think that this is really expensive , <EOS> but at the end this is plenty of unexpen eh very cheap devices but uh the bill starts to be <EOS>
there it is . <EOS> so . <EOS> so these are the three crite criterias for our evaluation of our product . <EOS> first of all uh comes user requirement . <EOS> so we will see whether this product meets all user requirements or not . <EOS> i i will <EOS> first i would like to have your views , <EOS> what do you think whether it meets all user requirements or not ? <EOS>
mm . <EOS> maybe like it'll beep or something . <EOS> and um , yep , <EOS> the uh time taken to learn new remote controls is <EOS> uh don't want to make it too complicated , easy to use for uh new like first time users and stuff . <EOS> and uh repetitive strain injury , <EOS> i suppose we should make it more comfortable <EOS> and make ma possibly even use have to make it , yeah , fewer buttons , <EOS> like i was saying about the whole mice the mouse idea of it feels more comfortable . <EOS> maybe don't even have to hold it as such . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> uh if i if i <EOS> i didn't have information about that . <EOS> yeah , i think it's <EOS> yeah . <EOS> but it has to work . <EOS> and and and does it have to work only in english , or in dutch too or <EOS>
um <EOS> enter , power as a s oh um a sum simultaneous key . <EOS> exactly . <EOS> again , you know , <EOS> thinking of menus or <EOS> is that okay with you ? <EOS> sorry , <EOS> i was miles away . <EOS> i was re i was reading the chart to be honest . <EOS>
yes . <EOS> but <EOS> and part of the thing is m a lot of people say that they don't like something that's too light , <EOS> because they don't feel like they have enough control over it . <EOS> so i mean maybe this is excessively heavy , <EOS> but i think it needs to have some weight , <EOS> it needs to feel like you're still holding something . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> and a different colour can use here <EOS> no <EOS> i just take the pink . <EOS> you take <EOS> oh <EOS> there's no pink , <EOS> okay , oh <EOS> just purple , okay . <EOS> no <EOS> blue . <EOS> and uh <EOS> line width ten . <EOS> okay uh <EOS> just take <EOS> what i'm going to draw is an elephant . <EOS>
okay , fenella ? <EOS> um , i drew a badger . <EOS> cool . <EOS> yay . <EOS> badger . good choice . <EOS> why a badger ? <EOS> well , yeah . <EOS> uh <EOS> i dunno , <EOS> they're grumpy and nocturnal and <EOS> are you trying to suggest something ? <EOS>
s <EOS> i stick to five . <EOS> i go slightly up . <EOS> six . <EOS> although it still has it still has the word of course at the beginning <EOS> so i dunno . um . <EOS> six . <EOS> w we have six , five <EOS> i'd give it i'd give it a <EOS>
so the the purpose is to to find uh the important questions to ask is what effect should the apparatus have . <EOS> so so i found on a webs on the internet <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i spent a lot of time searching <EOS> and uh and i found that uh the function of remote control is to send messages to television set . <EOS> for example switch on , switch off , switch the next channel and so on and so on . <EOS>
mm . yeah <EOS> but but but but uh i in there uh when this is closed , will it also uh cover up the l_c_d_ screen ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah yeah yeah yeah . <EOS> yeah . it's basically to do that . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> but but the l_c_d_ screen i mean is a very uh
okay , that sounds like a a good strong idea . um <EOS> 'kay <EOS> any takes on this ? <EOS> well <EOS> um i've noticed that uh gaming c is becoming quite popular with television , <EOS> um when i was younger <EOS> we used to e play games using our cable , using the cable subscribed the cable providers , <EOS> but our remote controls would get worn out really easily , <EOS> and the remote control was not a great kind of keyboar , um keypad , for playing games . <EOS> so perhaps one that was more um <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> okay , so let me finish with the the constraints which are almost done . <EOS> so we also need to to find the a spot for the photocopier , the fax machine , and the printer . <EOS> the fax , you know , is very small , <EOS> but um the photocopier is quite huge , <EOS> and the printer is uh well ab this size . <EOS> um okay , <EOS> the offices comes with white boards . <EOS> not very uh very important . <EOS> uh the furniture that w each each person has <EOS> and uh you have a list of people . <EOS> so the thing uh you you ought to know is that we're not the only ones that w we're thin that that are thinking about uh for well , about putting people i in these rooms . <EOS> um there is another group that is also having discussions . <EOS> so the idea is that today we'll just try to f start seeing the main constraints <EOS> and then you have time to to go and think about it uh <EOS> ask the people you know , your assistants , for instance , <EOS> and at the next meeting we'll try to to come with one solution . <EOS> uh , the other group will also propose a solution <EOS> and then there will be another negotiation . <EOS>
yes . <EOS> it's it's fine . it's <EOS> i like it . <EOS> next time . <EOS> well , i'll buy one here . <EOS> so buy one . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so <EOS> mm . <EOS> okay , i will close this . mm . <EOS> yeah . no ? <EOS>
mm uh . <EOS> we're the first . <EOS> mm . we're the first ones . <EOS> marketing expert , yes . <EOS> mm . <EOS> so you found your spots . <EOS> yes . <EOS> move to the meeting room . <EOS> okay . <EOS> bling bling . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> right . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> uh the logo was has to be on there . <EOS> yeah , that's right . <EOS> uh and how many uh fronts uh fronts do we put on the market then ? <EOS> uh five or something ? <EOS> or more <EOS> or <EOS> yeah , five . let's give five . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah , okay . <EOS> but <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah okay , <EOS> but the p print plate of l_ l_c_d_ screen is more advanced than a normal print plate , <EOS> so that that's not of any discussion , i think . <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
so , hamed , can you . <EOS> yeah . the second one . <EOS> could you please show the presentation number three . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> um . number ? <EOS> three . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> three . <EOS> this one ? <EOS> yes . <EOS> just could you please check if it is the first one or the second . <EOS> uh , n n no , it's the first one . <EOS> the second one . <EOS>
f for the l_c_d_ menu right ? <EOS> so w w <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> no not all because you need most of them , the arrow buttons . <EOS> but you can hide the okay and the back uh button . <EOS> and the menu button also because when you flip it open <EOS> and you can maybe even drop the menu button because maybe if you flip it open it will auto activate amauto uh uh automatically . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay , indeed . yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> 'cause otherwise i think i <EOS> okay , <EOS> but we have to rate uh these things now ? <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah , we have to rate . <EOS> is it fancy enough ? <EOS> true is one , <EOS> false is seven . <EOS> so <EOS> fancy enough means , does it comes to the younger people and the elder people . <EOS>
are we considering these points here ? <EOS> okay . <EOS> um . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i think they're starting blocks <EOS> yeah . <EOS> what do you guys feel about the process ? <EOS> um , you know <EOS> i think in general , for a day's worth of work we actually were relatively productive , <EOS> considering the little amount of input we had going in . <EOS> um , and the technology has definitely been a help , <EOS> it's really been interesting to try out all this new stuff . <EOS>
um m would make to sales . <EOS> it's <EOS> yeah ? <EOS> and like response from consumers . <EOS> and we could even you know , market two versions . <EOS> wee cheapie version with the nice bio-morphic rubber . <EOS> and then the final one where you get to call it hal . <EOS> but we'll go into that later . <EOS> right um <EOS> is there anything else that anybody would like to to add , um <EOS>
yeah , mayb b <EOS> but maybe we can bulk it with uh already this plastic thing and uh the waterproof uh stuff as well . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> directly . <EOS> i it will look a bulky in that case . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> maybe we can sell uh all that together , so so plastic protection and uh and a waterproof box as well . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> uh colour changeable , and also transparent . <EOS> and colour and transparent , or just transparent , <EOS> i don't know . <EOS> um then the elements . <EOS> uh we have <EOS> the functions are just basic . <EOS> like uh i've pointed them here . <EOS> mute function , on-off function , text functions . <EOS> this uh switch channel . <EOS> and this is the <EOS>
um would it take quite a while to sort of develop the speech recognition software in the remote control ? <EOS> considering <EOS> mm . <EOS> well if it does then we can't . <EOS> it's that simple , <EOS> because we've got uh th th three um primary um uh requisites from uh from and email uh that was sent to me <EOS>
yeah , <EOS> maybe it has some colourful patches , yeah . <EOS> um yeah and i do like dogs because they are good friends to people <EOS> and they are loyal . <EOS> the other legs are on the other side . <EOS> mm , <EOS> well that's compared to some other animals like cats . <EOS> um they're really much more fun because they are not so independent . <EOS> um <EOS>
spongy spongy . <EOS> mm mm . <EOS> so i think it should be much more customised to make a different uh shapes . <EOS> and the second thing is , and if the material , they really do not want it to be very hard , as in the case of very pl plastic or titanium , <EOS> it should be somewhat spongy . <EOS>
since you have to uh configure speech thing . <EOS> but that's definitely more expensive <EOS> than <EOS> yeah , <EOS> that's that's something i dunno . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> but how <EOS> uh we we're gonna make many of those . <EOS> so we can start a mass production , <EOS> and then the cost will still will be . <EOS>
yes <EOS> you'd know what kind of wood to get . <EOS> but th for that you'd also have to do sort of an average across families and things like that if unless everyone has their own personal remote . <EOS> that's right , that's right , you wouldn't wanna go too far down that . <EOS> oh that that actually would uh increase the um the revenues we could expect , yeah . <EOS>
i think so too . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> but then you can work together too <EOS> when <EOS> yeah m yeah , <EOS> like she told . then you can work together too by mail or by , i dunno , chat , something , <EOS> but now we're completely separated from each other . <EOS> i don't think that was the best way , <EOS> but <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> total . <EOS> uh then we will uh discuss <EOS> uh , well , how it should be <EOS> and uh wh what uh what our new product should look lite like . <EOS> and uh well then uh after some twenty five minutes i hope uh we can end this meeting . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> okay , <EOS> but uh uh when you think you can give me like a kind of design on the functional design or the technical design ? <EOS> well , uh i've got a lot of other projects i'm doing right now um <EOS> and so i'll have to wait and see how those uh how those go . <EOS> if they uh go quickly then uh it could be a month . <EOS> if um if i run into any problems in my other projects it might be six months . <EOS>
right okay . so i guess if we go ahead with the uh with the three presentations . <EOS> so we'll start with yourself <EOS> on the basis that uh <EOS> okay that's fine . <EOS> i'll just um i'll grab the wire out the back of this one . <EOS>
i'll go . <EOS> um this is my picture . <EOS> i drew fish <EOS> i like fish , because uh , you know , their whole water-vascular system thing . <EOS> it's pretty cool , <EOS> and um they've got a pretty good habitat <EOS> and they are pretty sometimes , sometimes vicious but that's okay . <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
no , <EOS> i mean in a <EOS> yeah . <EOS> it's not re it <EOS> you you think it's really fancy and fun ? <EOS> you think that young people that are <EOS> like with a banana you can have <EOS> i'm sure it's fun . <EOS> yeah . more than a banana ? <EOS>
so <EOS> the n <EOS> current trends ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah ? <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> well wha what i found <EOS> um can you <EOS> next slide ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> thank you . <EOS> what i found in order of importance from less to more important is that people want an easy to use device . <EOS> after they they want something new technologic technologically speaking , <EOS> but the most <EOS> what they what they find more more interesting , more or more important it's uh a fancy look and feel instead of uh instead of the current the current trend which was f the functional look and feel . <EOS> so now more more cool aspect , ma more a cooler aspect uh rather than a device with many functions and many buttons with <EOS> instead of i instead of ha of a device which can do many things , a device which is pleasant to to watch , to see . <EOS>
okay everybody is ready ? <EOS> good morning again . <EOS> so , today we are going to have a f second meeting . <EOS> oh michael , hi . <EOS> you're late . <EOS> you have a good reason for that ? <EOS> very good . <EOS> okay , let's have a look to the agenda today . <EOS>
so mm . <EOS> uh the maybe in the colour we can make it uh fruit and and veggie . but that's if you're using the covers . <EOS> or is it just one <EOS> and the then we can al <EOS> yes . <EOS> we can we can consider <EOS> uh uh is it possible do you think , to to make a cover
okay . uh our next meeting will be in thirty minutes , <EOS> and the uh i_d_ is to <EOS> this is the individual actions to be taken until then , <EOS> to have the look and feel design , <EOS> and uh the u_i_d_ is supposed to uh come up with the user interface design , <EOS>
um okay the most important finding was that the fancy look-and-feel seems to be twice as important to the users as the current functional look-and-feel design , <EOS> which i think we've kind of already discussed before . <EOS> um the second most important finding was that the remote should be technologically innovative . <EOS> and again these are all things we've kind of already come up with on our own , but this just backs it up . <EOS> and thirdly the remote would be easy to use . <EOS> as far as fashion update , we've learned that fruits and vegetables will be the most important theme for cloths , shoes and furniture . <EOS> so that might be a bit of a challenge to incorporate this into our remote , <EOS> but we can try . <EOS>
okay , <EOS> now the trouble is is we've already decided that we're going with the stuff that works already , that's cheap . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> actually , i mean , these first two points we've already sort of gone away from , <EOS> 'cause our rubber one is not fancy <EOS> i mean it's different , but i wouldn't say like a rubber remote is fancy . <EOS> if that's what people want then we maybe we're going in the wrong direction . <EOS> and it's it's not technologically innovative either . <EOS>
the thing is , i think if somebody saw that and you said what was that inspired from , i don't know if you'd instantly say mango . <EOS> oh yeah . <EOS> be like <EOS> no . <EOS> no . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> maybe if it was scented . <EOS> yeah we have money for that . um <EOS>
this is the basic basic premise of a remote control . <EOS> um the basic function is to send messages to another system . <EOS> okay <EOS> so much is clear . <EOS> an energy source feeds an integrated circuit , like a chip , <EOS> that can compose messages . often in the form of infrared bits . <EOS> this is the most mostly used . <EOS> um there's uh also some sound systems <EOS> but infrared is the better or the more more used system . <EOS> um parts are cheaper as well . <EOS> a user interface controls the chip and accordingly the messages . <EOS> this is where my people screwed up basically . <EOS> so i'm going to explain that on the board rather . <EOS> um what we have is different components that obviously need to go in there . <EOS> we'll start with an energy source . <EOS> right . um <EOS> which is usually a battery <EOS> right ? <EOS>
uh . <EOS> but that that that that can be done later . <EOS> we now can concentrate on the on the basic remote control . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah customized . <EOS> . <EOS> mm . <EOS> um . <EOS> okay . <EOS> we can give them smooth keys , <EOS> you know . <EOS> smooth keys with bigger s uh so that you know <EOS> the the problem most of the time we've seen , the keys is that it's small , <EOS> and every time we have to be very but if i the if we <EOS> if we go to a different ways of designing those keys , then you can merge them together <EOS> to <EOS>
should be here . smart board . <EOS> alright . <EOS> yeah you can open it with the picture preview or stuff like that . <EOS> don't know if you can use it but <EOS> okay . <EOS> and uh we have to make uh some maps with uh with the all the the data we uh gathered . <EOS>
sorry can you just say that what's the what are our price goals again ? <EOS> um selling price is twenty five euro . profit aim fifty million euro . <EOS> okay . <EOS> how many should we sell then ? <EOS> um , a lot , <EOS> two two two million , <EOS> two mi no , <EOS> more f four million . <EOS>
i think there's just one button so <EOS> handy . <EOS> yeah okay . <EOS> well well there we go . <EOS> so i'm just gonna have to redraw this now . <EOS> so we're not gonna have the l_c_d_ anymore , <EOS> and we'll just gonna have an on t on the t_v_ it'll show you what you're doing , <EOS> which i think is fair enough , <EOS> and so this is gonna be one big thing here . <EOS>
to fruit ? <EOS> was was able to <EOS> to buy a a n a cooler remote control . <EOS> but is it uh is fruit cool ? <EOS> what ? <EOS> that's a question . <EOS> what ? <EOS> is fruit cool ? <EOS> yeah ? <EOS> uh <EOS> is the new trend <EOS> of the <EOS>
mm . <EOS> so <EOS> we have more slides or ? <EOS> no <EOS> just this closing one . <EOS> no <EOS> we've established that the costs weren't really within budget , <EOS> but we could s you know do it <EOS> we got it to be . <EOS> we did the project evaluation based on um sarah's evaluation of on off switches <EOS> and <EOS>
yeah okay . that's true . <EOS> okay . yeah ? <EOS> well . i just uh ended the meeting . <EOS> you two go design . <EOS> yeah . i'm just thinking totally different designs also . <EOS> remember that the weird pocketphone thingy which looked like kind of a gameboy . <EOS> maybe we should try something like that . but yeah . <EOS>
yeah , yeah , yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so the t_v_ is the screen , that <EOS> yeah <EOS> so it would have all these different options of changing <EOS> yeah . <EOS> but the remote itself isn't really cluttered up . <EOS>
okay , right . <EOS> ta . <EOS> and is it going to include any of the uh the more advanced features , <EOS> or are we gonna eliminate those ? <EOS> um <EOS> i think we include mute , <EOS> but apart from that um i think we just we'll go for the simpleness . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> you m titanium it's more uh <EOS> yeah . <EOS> w we can use something like you know the whole body's titanium <EOS> but there are some rubber or i dunno some rubber parts <EOS> like <EOS> to make it feel better <EOS> and to <EOS> you know <EOS>
break it , i don't get <EOS> yeah , <EOS> th th th that i uh <EOS> yeah . <EOS> it's very sensitive . <EOS> oh so yeah . <EOS> like my telephone , it's uh it's sensitive too . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay well uh <EOS> it's almost at the end . <EOS> so we have now a lunch break , finally , <EOS> yeah . <EOS> uh after the lunch break uh it's back to uh individual work , once again uh thirty minutes . <EOS> uh i will put my minutes <EOS> uh i have updated them <EOS> so uh s they're updated in the shared folder too . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> on the the board . <EOS> does somebody have ideas for a form <EOS> or <EOS> mm . <EOS> uh we can just use the regular form of it , <EOS> but it's um not quite uh fancy . <EOS> so um <EOS> yeah . <EOS> um you uh said you wanted to put the um changing channels button on the right side , <EOS> so you could , so your thumb would be easily <EOS> well uh <EOS> i think that was a very good point <EOS> 'cause i pointed out earlier that a lot of remotes cause r_s_i_ . <EOS> so that would be great for that . <EOS> um i thought maybe we could just make one of those buttons on both the left and the right side . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> not for such simple functions <EOS> because we're focusing on that , <EOS> yes okay . <EOS> and they're <EOS> yeah , they should be f yeah . <EOS> simple . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> puts people off reading them so they just do the obvious , yes . <EOS>
i see , so it's more just basic . right , okay . <EOS> looks kind of yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . sure . <EOS> well i think it's a valid point . <EOS> i mean like the one on the left looks quite um quite complicated , <EOS> and that p_r_t_ p p_r_o_t_ thing is incredibly confusing . <EOS> um so i see i see why yo you know you might prefer the simpler design , <EOS> but yeah you don't want to lose out on , you know , what it does , <EOS> so maybe you know <EOS> you know you get a lot of remote controls where you kind of flip the thing open , <EOS> i think that's a good idea . <EOS> i think it's a good idea . <EOS>
okay , some sort of bird <EOS> . a seagu <EOS> right , <EOS> not a seagull . <EOS> ah eagle , right okay . eagle , okay . <EOS> they're good at golf . indepen independent , right , <EOS> did you say they're good at golf ? <EOS> are they ? <EOS> oh . oh right , okay , <EOS> i'm not good at golf . <EOS> i'd say they're quite free-spirited , flying around everywhere , doing their own thing . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> or you get it . <EOS> okay . <EOS> no i don't think so <EOS> it has to be like that <EOS> yeah <EOS> and you have to adjust the length . <EOS> okay , and then . <EOS> so <EOS> we uh we will wait for anna , a few minutes . <EOS>
r_s_i_ mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah , it's electromagnetic waves or something kind of maybe uh effect . <EOS> oh , okay , <EOS> i think it's a technical thing <EOS> which our <EOS> no , i don't think so . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> because infrared uses some electromagnetic technology , <EOS> and those waves have high <EOS>
oh you know like in circular in shape or <EOS> yeah <EOS> 'cause that will n help narrow down the choice of <EOS> yeah . <EOS> choice of material yeah . <EOS> 'cause i i i was kinda thinking about as well you know how you get these shock resistant mobile phones , <EOS> and they're plastic but then also have like rubber on the outside , <EOS> and it kinda feels it feels kind of warmer to the touch . <EOS> it feels a bit more comfortable , <EOS> and maybe we could incorporate plastic and rubber <EOS>
alright . <EOS> um <EOS> that's nice . <EOS> no . <EOS> f_ five . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> alright . <EOS> okay . <EOS> i uh had uh two examples . <EOS> um this one is the the yeah the advanced one with a lot of options and functions and buttons . <EOS> this the easy one <EOS> i think we have to to combine them . and uh yeah merge the best functions of all examples . <EOS>
yeah okay but only for the basic functi if you're going to use the advanced option , you're going to press the the menu button and then yeah . <EOS> yeah i mean a screen on top looks more lo logical to me . <EOS> also because people use m mobile phones and they also have the screen on top . <EOS> so you you just have to reach a little bit for the power button . <EOS> i mean if you grab it . <EOS> but most most of the times if a if if a t_v_'s on standby people just press a channel to put it on . <EOS> so we put this on top , and then make the corporate logo <EOS>
right . <EOS> figure out how probably best to lay out this idea of this simple design with the voice recognition built in and also this kind of drop down or s on the side kind of menu options simple . <EOS> somehow work out how we can get this all s in the same place . <EOS> um , and if you can check product evaluation with m some pilots and stuff . <EOS> um i need you guys to work together on making a prototype , um using um prototype building materials um . <EOS> and also um specific instructions will be sent to you by your coaches as well . <EOS> so that's what to start with for now , <EOS> is that alright , <EOS> you guys feel clear about this ? <EOS>
uh w w what do y what uh <EOS> you compare with traditional uh um tr traditional controller ? <EOS> i think it's easier than traditional controller . <EOS> if you use traditional controller you have to put a button , but now you don't have to put button , <EOS> you have you just turn the turn the ball . <EOS> there's two kind of balls , <EOS> the smaller the the the so you can c you can c you can control the scale . <EOS> but in the traditional controller , how do how can you control the scale ? <EOS>
okay . <EOS> yeah maybe this this is important . <EOS> moreover th maybe those uh like those teenager customer could advice their parents to buy this equipment <EOS> and so we can <EOS> we have to take care of that point of view i think <EOS> or so . <EOS>
yes . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yes . <EOS> mm just have a yeah <EOS> yeah <EOS> like they do in with cars i think . yeah inside the car <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so <EOS> they also emailed me that uh they have available a bunch of different buttons , a scroll wheels , integrated push buttons s such as a computer mouse . and uh very cheap l_c_d_s , so liquid crystal displays , <EOS> so i'm wondering , i think we might be able to integrate l_c_d_ into our r_c_ . <EOS>
well <EOS> if if sarah's keen on a spongy feel , <EOS> the the rubber that we're talking about is the same as you have in those little stress balls , <EOS> so it's <EOS> yeah . <EOS> that's exactly what i was thinking . i'm sold . <EOS> what about you ? <EOS>
sorry , <EOS> yep . <EOS> oh . <EOS> what is it ? <EOS> i'm not quite sure how it <EOS> i think you've got to do um control f_ eight . <EOS> control <EOS> doesn't seem to be quite working at the moment . <EOS> shift f_ eight . <EOS>
they do . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay so we've got a flip-screen . <EOS> okay . <EOS> um <EOS> what i was thinking of a design which nokia h uh came up with almost six or seven years back . <EOS> basically we have a flat one it it looks like a box , like a chocolate . <EOS> that's very strenuous <EOS> because your thumb is slightly up , <EOS> so they came up with something like this , curled up , so here , <EOS> and you don't have to you don't bend your thumb too much , <EOS> so it's like uh you can say a banana shape kind of thing , curled up like a boat . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> and the other thing , you say we need to we need to keep it just television , <EOS> but i think one maybe one option , since this is supposed to be a kind of a fashionable device , is you know there's a certain kind of cool or wow factor that you can kind of you can have with technology , <EOS> and maybe we wanna make it something that's extensible to do other tasks . <EOS> say you have like um a little another little kind of base unit that can also receive signals as well as the television where you can , say uh , change the lighting in the room . <EOS> you know that would be something maybe you could sell as an extra , so that it doesn't have to be part of the initial development , <EOS> but , you know , later on you could you can you know you <EOS> also , selling the potential of the device . <EOS> then you say potentially you can then do other cool stuff like change the lights , i dunno , close the windows , whatever , turn the heating on , <EOS> and um , i think that's something we may need to have as as at least as an optional extra to to kinda make our product cool , since we say we're putting the fashion in electronics . <EOS>
accessible from your thumb <EOS> yeah palm-held <EOS> and all the <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> buttons are accessible from your thumb . <EOS> notice you have a number ten button . <EOS> so you don't have to <EOS> oh that was a mistake , <EOS> wasn't it ? <EOS> right no , that's a zero . <EOS> take that one off . <EOS>
yeah <EOS> you you could do a colour change , <EOS> so therefore you would <EOS> yeah yeah <EOS> i mean that's effectively what they did with the with the mobile phones , was to have some in blue , some in red , some in rather than all in black <EOS> or , you know , which four do you want , as long as it's black ? <EOS> but uh so <EOS>
yeah <EOS> 'cause the <EOS> well 'cause we have to have both right ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i mean let's let's face it , <EOS> it also depends on the software on the on the television . <EOS> you can have the the information that this thing transmits be being displayed on the on the screen . <EOS> so s yeah let's take away the <EOS>
okay . s <EOS> okay . <EOS> will be down or <EOS> okay . <EOS> so that they're separate a bit , <EOS> yeah . <EOS> uh and it's easy to press the other the big buttons , but uh , it's not that difficult to press the the channel buttons either . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah , i think that if you put the cover it will be even more difficult for the user . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> cool . <EOS> so <EOS> yeah . great . <EOS> champagne lunch anyone ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> uh . <EOS>
yeah . i think we do . <EOS> or just leave it ? <EOS> uh could make an uh a volume button uh scroll , volume button . <EOS> yeah <EOS> or j or also scrolling for the m yeah . <EOS> yeah ? <EOS> for menu . or <EOS> i dunno . <EOS> we w kind of wanted to stick with the <EOS>
um i think probably for the first couple of hours of using it <EOS> um but you know muscle memory's a wonderful thing , um . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm . <EOS> and i think and i think that size of uh display was about what i had in mind . <EOS> um though i mean i w i would say that uh we could probably probably be required to um mo <EOS> most of the mobile phone displays you see these days are colour <EOS> but we should probably try to stick to black and white . <EOS> si si simply to keep m keep the unit cost down . <EOS>
talking to the bosses , basically , and uh <EOS> f fielding off some more spam and <EOS> uh <EOS> great . <EOS> that's it really . <EOS> keeping things t well , <EOS> uh you know , ho hopefully uh keeping things together . um . <EOS> yeah , that's <EOS> this is this is uh good . <EOS> so we know for definite we know we've we've now got some definite things going on . <EOS> we definitely know how it's powered , <EOS> we definitely know that um it's gonna be a simple buttons , <EOS> we're not gonna be going for the new technological chip on print expensive things , so we've we're keeping the costs down . <EOS> it's this rubber casing that we can sell as um fun and funky . <EOS> don't know of any other remote controls that are made out of this stuff . <EOS> people , you know , people are saying , oh , standard stuff gives you repetitive strain injury , well this remote control is designed to do the complete opposite , <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> and uh of course solar cells . <EOS> but i dunno how we would use that into the design of the actual product . <EOS> so uh my <EOS> yeah also also in you know countries where there's n isn't much light like in scandinavia , they wouldn't be y able to use it half of the year you know . <EOS> so that's not cool either . <EOS>
oh like the phones , <EOS> yeah , it could change colours , yeah . <EOS> cool . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> ch <EOS> yeah . <EOS> good . <EOS> good idea . <EOS> and it should be really small and . <EOS> small also ? <EOS> don't you think <EOS>
oh no <EOS> th that's what that's what i thought , <EOS> but maybe maybe it doesn't . <EOS> um i think i might have got that wrong . <EOS> oh . <EOS> so okay . <EOS> speech recognition you reckon then is s simple . <EOS> and so we would want it in as an extra <EOS> because it doesn't appear to cost too much . <EOS> would that be <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so w w w will you ask people just for their place or also for the other people's place ? <EOS> because <EOS> uh-huh . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> i would i would ask for their place . <EOS> i mean that's that's that's the important thing you want to know . <EOS>
um uh the ergonom ergonomic design <EOS> well mm i mean i d uh i dunno , i mean the the repetitive stress things , <EOS> but then who would be really pushing the buttons so much on the on the remote control anyway , <EOS> yeah ? see . <EOS>
um , again probably not what we're going for <EOS> so i i mean my ideas here and kind of where i think we're heading is something slightly larger than a regular ipod uh with a hard cla c uh plastic casing <EOS> although i think some of the suggestions we've come up with are definitely uh very good ideas . <EOS> uh changeable casings uh our design team was possibly talking about including one extra face plate with the package <EOS> to kind of set the idea that you can change it <EOS> and you can try changing it <EOS> and kind of get used to thinking about maybe buying another one <EOS> which can add value to our uh bottom line . <EOS>
i think <EOS> well <EOS> okay no problem . <EOS> is there an order ? <EOS> i haven't <EOS> ja precies , ja precies , ja precies <EOS> so . <EOS> huh ? <EOS> okay , um <EOS> and one question , <EOS> uh your name denni , is it with a <EOS>
okay . <EOS> oh , alright . <EOS> it'll take me the rest of the time to get my microphone out from my necklace . <EOS> oh , there we go . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> so again it's sort of like just give you ideas <EOS> and then down at the bottom you have the logos <EOS> and that's where you could put the r_r_ , real reaction . <EOS> 'kay . <EOS> and then finally these are like the sort of same examples , <EOS> but also some more , just possibilities that we could go with . <EOS> none of them i'm particularly keen on by the way . <EOS>
uh is the project evaluated , that is mine . <EOS> doesn't tell me . <EOS> oh you're doing that . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> we evaluated ourselves , we thought we were great . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> uh . <EOS> mm , love to eat that now . <EOS> kind of a green banana now . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> so that's the led , l_e_d_ . <EOS> yeah . yeah , <EOS> and this is a led too . <EOS> but this one is producing infrared light <EOS> that's invisible . <EOS> and this one is producing normal light . <EOS> yeah , okay . <EOS> so <EOS> we can make the normal one also a normal light . not a led light , but as a normal one . <EOS>
no we can we can't use that . <EOS> you <EOS> we can ? we can't . <EOS> we can't use that to <EOS> communicate . <EOS> to comman co communicate , <EOS> it's just a thing <EOS> yeah , but we can say channel twenty five . <EOS> no ? <EOS>
you have to cycle through . yeah . <EOS> um kate to do the components , for you , steph , to do the user interface <EOS> and for you the trend-watching . <EOS> um and each of us will get help from our coach . <EOS> are we agreed to get ourselves together and then have lunch ? <EOS> okay . <EOS> then that's the end of this meeting . <EOS> and i hope that's good enough for her to tell her that's the end . <EOS> okay ? <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> i don't know what's going on with this again . <EOS> w why is the uh double curved two of them ? <EOS> oh , good point . <EOS> and double curve on both sides ? <EOS> um . <EOS> curve . <EOS> yeah , this is double-curve , <EOS> no ? <EOS> this is double-curve . <EOS> it <EOS> this one is single curve . <EOS>
i is there a matter for a new remote control ? <EOS> yeah if it's trendy , original i d fulfil the user needs . <EOS> is it uh a single device remote control or is it a multi-device remote control ? <EOS> we have to discuss that point . <EOS> on <EOS> yeah you you can suggest points like this . <EOS> so what what <EOS> so we have to decide for example if it can control one device or multiple . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> there you go . <EOS> to guide me and guide us on this project <EOS> 'cause you're gonna be you're g you guys are the bottom <EOS> you know <EOS> you're like no you can't do that you can't have you know x_ and y_ um at the same time . <EOS> and then um we'll work up from what is necessary to more like what would be good , <EOS> you know like um <EOS> i i think you guys probably got the same emails i did <EOS> but the idea of um , yes a coffee pot needs to be able to hold coffee <EOS> but it's also better if it's not like really cheap glass <EOS> so that it if you touch it you hurt your hand , or something like that . <EOS> um and so we'll work up from there <EOS> and um then we'll meet on <EOS> and talk about it <EOS> and then finally we'll incorporate as kind of the last stage you know where you guys build or tell me tell us what's possible <EOS> and then you tell us what we can um hope for and what way to go <EOS> take the the the take the basics <EOS> and make it nicer <EOS> and then ov obviously uh the u_i_d_ and the i_d_ you know you you can keep on the you know sort of at the cutting edge of how to get about maximising what is possible <EOS> um to try t of sync it all up . <EOS> so that's the detailed design . <EOS> so it's a three stage kind of thing . <EOS>
so when when you are making it on <EOS> it's used only when you <EOS> mm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> no eight or eight or ten hours of working . <EOS> if you are just leaving like that it'll be much longer . <EOS> ah , okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS>
oops . <EOS> it's in the middle of one of the little r_s . <EOS> and then the other one is the power . <EOS> and uh we just have a simple design . <EOS> we wanted it all to be <EOS> oh . okay . <EOS> so it's palm-held . <EOS>
ah , that's a good idea . <EOS> right . <EOS> so like a kind of backwards remote from the telly . <EOS> right and then it would do just you know , uh subtractive kind of cancellation of the noise . <EOS> what you could do then would be you have uh a remote controlled by the t_v_ speaker , <EOS> or not a remo i'm sorry , <EOS> a microphone by the t_v_ speaker and a transmitter there that sends back to your remote , <EOS> 'cause you can't um expect uh the the television manufacturers to to put that feature into their t_v_s . <EOS>
instead of having many switches , y <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yes <EOS> and and and then you get feedback via the l_c_d_ <EOS> yeah . <EOS> the l_c_d_ can display what is that on that , <EOS> and uh well <EOS> you can have a integrated microphone over here , <EOS> or in the button th here , <EOS> so which can <EOS> uh basically <EOS> you want to do a speech recognition and uh that channel a lot of information can be di displayed here directly on the um on your on your display . <EOS> and here is a small l_e_d_ <EOS> which is like blinking one , <EOS> which tells you like uh are you running out of the battery , <EOS> and which is can be useful for the locating as i was talking earlier <EOS> okay . and uh well <EOS> then we have a cover <EOS> basically , basically <EOS> you don't need much of the time this , <EOS> when you need you can use it , <EOS> and this gives additional functionality <EOS> that tomorrow you want you can add a tactile thing
case material we said rubber . <EOS> i don't know what special colour means . <EOS> rubber . <EOS> yep . <EOS> mm anything uh i think which is not more . <EOS> i think something coloured , <EOS> yeah , probably . <EOS> so i think this is probably special co no ? <EOS>
it's <EOS> okay . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> the feel . <EOS> 'kay . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> is that going to be <EOS> this image i've got in my head of something kind of shaped like that , maybe about that size , made of plastic , fits into the palm of the hand , rubberised cover that's spongy . <EOS> is that really going to fit fancy look and feel <EOS> which was the major thing that people wanted , market research , <EOS> is that fancy ? <EOS>
that a question we can ask . <EOS>
no that that that seemed like a novel idea as f as far as i know . <EOS> i mean obviously another exists like you like you said in in mobile phones . <EOS> that was sort of the inspiration for it . <EOS> um i've never seen that with in in all my years in in the remote business . <EOS>
if your fashion is b is carmen miranda , you betcha . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> well the recent fashion is rather displayed in the in the l_c_d_ and the way you operate it than the form and the colour , <EOS> but it definitely is <EOS> on the <EOS> it's true . <EOS>
the rounds of it from softer s <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> and um then the l_e_d_ . <EOS> the normal infrared l_e_d_ i think s sufficient . <EOS> and back light l_e_d_s . <EOS> so <EOS> but i think we have to make the case transparent , <EOS> otherwise the back light won't work . <EOS> so if you put <EOS>
okay , alright . <EOS> so um we should decide which kind of remote control we want to uh we want to uh we want to go . <EOS> should be should <EOS> should it be um specific remote control to some specific device ? <EOS> should it be a universal one ? <EOS> and uh etcetera . <EOS> so um so i'm waiting for your for your inputs very quickly <EOS> because we have only three three minutes to go . <EOS>
one . <EOS> i i like the colours . one . <EOS> one . <EOS> yes . <EOS> one . <EOS> yeah , one . <EOS> one , one , one , okay . <EOS> and how about the feel ? <EOS> taking into um consideration texture and comfort in the hand . <EOS>
a ratty . <EOS> not a mouse , a rat . <EOS> a webbed foot . <EOS> webbed f <EOS> oh right . <EOS> it's clothes . that's it's clothes . <EOS> it's a ratty with a with a with a very long tail . <EOS> and your favourite characteristics of that animal . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . and from from the discussion we had do you can you make it on the whiteboard , or mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , i'm sure , <EOS> because since our user interface speech recognition <EOS> and also marketing expert for the speech recognition is really handy , <EOS> so <EOS> we can have another , like uh s simple speech recogniser on our d_s_b_ chip . <EOS> since we have some kind of uh energy <EOS> this is our <EOS>
okay . <EOS> and also in the num-pads , there's also colour light behind it . <EOS> and do you still can , do you still can choose what colour , kind of colour you want ? <EOS> how do you want to implement that ? <EOS> just on the <EOS> maybe on the second level as well ? <EOS>
mm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> so is that one of our definite requirements that they wa that it needs a t_f_t_ screen ? <EOS> okay . <EOS> um no , i mean that was going on ravs uh raj's sort of um marketing research i guess . <EOS> um <EOS> uh <EOS> so we'll stick with sort of programmability um for the buttons that we do have . <EOS> um . <EOS> so that's sort of included in your sub-module kind of stuff , um <EOS>
like cutting corners . <EOS> kind of , <EOS> though it was really technically an evaluation of the product , not the project in general . <EOS> mm . <EOS> true . <EOS> mm . <EOS> which i'm not sure is the same thing , <EOS> at the time that just i made more sense , <EOS> but i could see if they were really asking about us . <EOS>
yeah . though it was our specification . <EOS> no . wouldn't be simple , yeah . <EOS> yeah we want it simple . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> we didn't want it any more than that . <EOS> okay question number three . <EOS> uh , will it be easy to use ? <EOS>
i think , you might have to disconnect rose . <EOS> yes i do . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> well <EOS> there's a wee a wee plug just just that one there <EOS> where does it go ? <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> hmm , i'm not supposed to move this , <EOS> but <EOS>
okay , um <EOS> obviously all of us were here for the last meeting , <EOS> we reviewed the previous minutes before that , <EOS> um each of you made your presentations . <EOS> um we discussed the various possibilities based on what was presented in those presentations . <EOS> the market trend of fruit and veg , mm spongy , uh fancy and elegant more than technologically innovative and that more than easy . <EOS> um we decided chip on print would be used . <EOS> um we would use plastic with a rubber casing , i think was the consensus , <EOS> powered by kinetic energy . <EOS> there was no decision made on the curvatures or double curvature or straight . <EOS> um perhaps the prototype will give us an inkling of that . <EOS> um looking like a scroll , <EOS> but it's really a push button technology , excuse my spelling um that was actually in use , <EOS> that is uh behind the scenes is push button <EOS> which we uh according to kate have a very good uh grasp on doing that in production . <EOS> um we decided that separate fashionable covers covering your fruit and veg might be a separate product <EOS> that could be suggested to management . <EOS> um and as suggested um yellow with black buttons with the company logo , a slogan and image might be a good idea based on the requirements that have been provided to us . <EOS> um we did have a few production issues and coordination of the various bits <EOS> and we had some conflict of ideas and cost constraints <EOS> and we ran out of time . <EOS> um we had to follow that up <EOS> and prepare for the last one . <EOS> and uh we closed <EOS> as it ran out of time . <EOS> is that a fair presentation of what happened ? <EOS> okay , <EOS> back to this meeting . <EOS> um we're down to the prototype presentation . <EOS>
no . there is nothing . <EOS> there's no <EOS> we have a technical problem . <EOS> let's go and check . <EOS> i'll go and check . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> otherwise , could you just describe <EOS> by hand ? <EOS> with the the whiteboard ? <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
it is a bit limiting , isn't it ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , and and and this time also the time limits but actually preparing the <EOS> yeah . <EOS> the thing flew in , <EOS> you didn't have the whole whooshing thing , <EOS> 'cause there wasn't time for that , so yeah . <EOS>
yeah <EOS> the only problem there might be which know , i if it's very sensitive , <EOS> they will , <EOS> i don't know <EOS> yeah . <EOS> but it is uh it is surrounded by rubber material . <EOS> so maybe we can put a six . <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
um well uh <EOS> according to our agenda it's then time to take a decision on the remote control functions . <EOS> mm . so , <EOS> who has any idea about what should be on it , and what shouldn't ? <EOS> well you said it should only uh work with one appliance ? <EOS> or with one uh d che only the t_v_ ? <EOS>
okay . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> um i just realised one thing . <EOS> in the financing there was no room for our voice recogniser . <EOS> yes . <EOS> yes . <EOS> ah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> and uh i don't know how we can evaluate that or how we can include that , too . <EOS>
uh okay <EOS> we basically have the same kinda lay-out here <EOS> it's just um <EOS> you hold it like this <EOS> and it gets kinda moulded to the to the shape of your hand , basically . <EOS> um on the left we've got the scroll for the volume , <EOS> on the right we have buttons for the channels up and down and that kinda <EOS> so you can hold it and scroll , <EOS> or you can hold it and and push . <EOS> uh this is the power key , <EOS> um it's kinda like the biggest <EOS> so you know how to turn on . <EOS>
oh . <EOS> okay . <EOS> i i it it's just the way that the the the uh th the way it's ac it's actually built <EOS> and you you print onto the circuit board like you might print onto paper . <EOS> what about the ca <EOS> yeah . <EOS> oh , <EOS> the way we <EOS> uh-huh . <EOS> oh , okay . <EOS> um what about the case ? <EOS> i think they're talking there about do we want wood , plastic , titanium or rubber , <EOS> and i think we've discussed not having titanium . <EOS> one , it's too expensive , <EOS> um and second , it won't do this double um curves . <EOS> um we've sort of eliminated wood . <EOS> we said plastic or rubber . <EOS> what's the pleasure ? <EOS>
yes . <EOS> so <EOS> if we have to stick with current technologies and uh um well yeah , the restrictions of what's uh is on the market today , um you should keep it s at this . <EOS> use big clear buttons . not too many . <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
second generation . <EOS> second generation . <EOS> okay . there's no end , there's not limit . <EOS> every every custom <EOS> the problem is there might not be a second generation if the first generation flops for some silly reason that we haven't thought of . <EOS> well , then it may not be . <EOS>
three three , it's three <EOS> sorry . <EOS> i i think i'm a . <EOS> okay , never mind . <EOS> okay . <EOS> 'kay , <EOS> did you save your presentation ? <EOS> in one . <EOS> in one , <EOS> sorry . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> isn't that technical functions ? <EOS>
okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> yep . <EOS> it's still an option if we need it . <EOS> very cool , nice job . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> right , yeah <EOS> thanks guys <EOS> that's very , very good work . <EOS> i like it , <EOS> brilliant . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> you guys know your stuff . <EOS> as it happens to remote controls . um as for the point that we making about losing it . well , we wanna small r remote control one side <EOS> because uh we want it to be cool and uh designed , <EOS> but um apparently um market shows that bigger s bigger um remotes get less lost , <EOS> about <EOS>
mm . <EOS> okay . <EOS> well , <EOS> does it <EOS> okay . so <EOS> after , the technological aspect ? <EOS> okay , techne technological aspect . <EOS> so <EOS> we we said uh we have uh a new technological uh thing with a wheel . <EOS> yeah , we have the wheel . <EOS> we also have the rubber material , <EOS>
well <EOS> i think th th <EOS> yeah <EOS> we should stick with uh a number of keys <EOS> because if we add too much then <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah <EOS> it it should not be cluttering up everything . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> it's too <EOS> what's this one on the side ? <EOS>
okay . <EOS> well i don't know if this information is available from teletext , also . <EOS> well no , <EOS> but there are the electronic programme guides out there . <EOS> they may not have pictures , but maybe they do . <EOS> there's dependi it also depends on the country . <EOS>
but if we use the l_c_d_ uh even the radio frequency communication with the t_v_ set and the backlight and uh related things like the photo diodes and stuff , it should be okay . <EOS> if we decide to use the speech recognition , then we probably could struggle <EOS> but we'll see afterwards . <EOS> it depends of you if if the m_e_ or u_i_d_ , <EOS> i'm sorry about the names , <EOS> i don't really know , <EOS> uh want to have it like in metal or in plastic , these things , <EOS> it it depends on you not <EOS> because the the the electronic device's price is not not so big in comparison to to the overall shape and stuff like that , so . <EOS> we will discuss it afterwards . <EOS>
yeah , yeah . <EOS> ah such yeah . <EOS> you've already said mobile phones . <EOS> yeah , and following <EOS> tha that would that would make it . yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah , you can keep the global appearan <EOS> the mood of persons , the fashions uh <EOS>
six ? <EOS> we're we're good yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> it's <EOS> i think eventually if we do um branch out with this product maybe we do have a higher budget options <EOS> and if it goes over with this model we can look into um wider range voice recognition like from other rooms of the house and stuff , <EOS> but for now , what we've got is working in the range we need it for , <EOS> so <EOS> it's all good . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> oh . <EOS> yeah , because mushroom was not in the trends . <EOS> i mean there was fruits yeah . yeah . <EOS> really ? <EOS> but <EOS> fruits and vegetables . <EOS> fruit and vegetable , <EOS> so mushroom was a kind of you know uh <EOS>
and if we make <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> that's a lot of selling . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> two four <EOS> four million . <EOS> to be fifty , be <EOS> four million . you'd have to sell four million . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> experience with a remote control . <EOS>
uh-huh . no problem . <EOS> it's a rabbit . <EOS> and uh well uh <EOS> it's uh quick , i guess . <EOS> little rabbits . <EOS> that's uh my uh favourite animal . <EOS> okay , <EOS> thank you . <EOS> okay . <EOS> and our final drawing . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . so <EOS> you suggest we should design two different telephones <EOS> so that would <EOS> on which you can apply , yeah remote controls , on which you can apply different case covers , for example . <EOS> well <EOS> i wouldn't design a telephone <EOS> but <EOS>
so this is our proposed model . <EOS> now the marketing expert has to <EOS> tell , yeah . <EOS> give her suggestion whether it'll be sellable or it'll be cost effective . <EOS> okay , well um <EOS> what <EOS> what i really like a lot about it is that you can reach the whole thing with one thumb , <EOS> that you can really hold it in one h you don't need two hands <EOS> and it's easily reachable even for somebody with a small hand , yeah ? <EOS>
yeah , <EOS> kinda like this whole <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah , mm . <EOS> so you could use like this and it would go . <EOS> um so <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> 'cause i mean the r reality is people are they're gonna be looking at the television whilst they're using it , the chances are , <EOS> so if if they're holding it anyway , the they're reasonably likely to be holding it to use it , <EOS> then uh then that that's the sort of coverage that we want . <EOS>
yeah <EOS> uh the the uh or or b <EOS> yeah , <EOS> like an . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> i'd i'd um <EOS> yeah . uh no <EOS> i d i i agree , <EOS> i mean we're we're we're simply it's simply required to incorporate the the the the corporate logo prominently um . <EOS>
okay jog-dial for volume . <EOS> and what else do you do with the jog-dial ? <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> um you can use it for um more advanced functions like contrast , colour and <EOS> contrast , <EOS> brightness , <EOS> yeah , <EOS> and anything else ? <EOS> um yeah . <EOS> um just whatever else we wanted to include as the advanced functions , <EOS> um we didn't actually go through and specify the <EOS>
'kay . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> but this is just a breakdown of what we'll be doing individually . <EOS> um the industrial design , alima will be doing um the working design . <EOS> um the user interface designer , that's for . technical functions , i guess like keeping in mind the buttons thing , the size of the buttons . <EOS> um user requirements um , so you'll be hearing about different trends , uh about different things that people need , <EOS> um i guess kind of the same uh discussion that we've been having , we'll get from the actual consum s consumers . <EOS>
yeah that'd be really good . yeah yeah . <EOS> yeah . yeah . <EOS> or or there might be a light running through it like a mouse . <EOS> you know you have cordless mice and they don't eat that much power right . <EOS> so the power the battery in that sense , <EOS> maybe you have one or two stratig strategically placed lights <EOS> that sort of <EOS>
good . <EOS> beep . <EOS> oh . <EOS> what ? <EOS> so well uh <EOS> welcome everyone . <EOS> um as you may have noticed i uh <EOS> yeah . <EOS> created separate folders <EOS> because it was uh tending to get a little busy in our uh shared project documents uh folder . <EOS> i don't know if everybody uh put their own uh documents in the right folder , <EOS> which is for now the detailed design meeting . <EOS>
yeah yeah . <EOS> uh that's a good idea . <EOS> yeah . yeah . <EOS> um so <EOS> i think teletext can v can be very useful in our advantage . um <EOS> functionality should be few buttons , you said . <EOS> yes . <EOS> i think uh that's very important we have a few buttons . <EOS>
out of forty nine , i guess . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> out of forty nine with with zero being the highest . <EOS> we are at uh two , seven , eight , ten , fifteen point five . <EOS> 's pretty good . <EOS> so it's pretty good . <EOS> translates to something like about approximately seventy two percent efficacy of our original goal . <EOS> right ? <EOS>
and i was thinking about different types of designs and i came up with something . <EOS> actually right here . <EOS> so what we could do is something like an old-fashioned telephone <EOS> like this , <EOS> where we put the buttons around , like we'd put a big on-off button or something else in the middle , <EOS> i mean it could be the arrows or whatever for channel up and down , <EOS> and then put the numbers around in like an old-fashioned dial shape . <EOS> 'cause then it'll appeal to older generation <EOS> and like said retro's cool . <EOS> so it's classically retro . <EOS> so i mean that's just an idea if you guys like it . <EOS>
yeah . mm-hmm . <EOS> is it possible that that for the older generation you could have like an extra button that you press for large print like you do in large print books ? <EOS> obviously it displays less on the screen , <EOS> it displays less on the screen <EOS> but as long as they can read it that's the main thing . <EOS>
mm . so , <EOS> the l_c_d_ screen uh attracts , <EOS> yes . <EOS> because it <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i think especially if we're gonna n have an l_c_d_ screen on a low range product then that's good . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm , ma maybe that's something to consider , yes , <EOS> so . <EOS>
i think it's yellow <EOS> because like the website is yellow and there's a band at the bottom is yellow , <EOS> so yellow , lemon , you know definitely food for thought there , <EOS> but keep going <EOS> and we'll discuss it after . <EOS> okay . <EOS> and the play-doh 's yellow . <EOS>
no , <EOS> not a cat though . <EOS> what is this now ? <EOS> ah you forget about it . <EOS> you're on the knife . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> uh i think it's fine . <EOS> i just don't want to carry it off . <EOS> man , this wires , <EOS> eh ? <EOS> we need a wireless microphone . <EOS>
okay , well , <EOS> what do you two think about this ? <EOS> so is is the advantage of bluetooth that you can just like synchronise it with other <EOS> but like <EOS> electronics ? <EOS> yeah , what i don't understand what m <EOS> you could always insert , yeah . <EOS>
great . <EOS> okay , <EOS> uh if we're still all with us . <EOS> right okay , so . <EOS> work has been done on uh this uh project where by um twenty five euros is uh the uh expected uh selling price . <EOS> that information has come from our marketing manager here . <EOS> so we're looking to sell internationally , not just in europe . <EOS> we're looking at um having our production costs limited to uh twelve and an half euro per unit . <EOS> and therefore making a profit margin of uh well not actually a profit margin it's uh because obviously you're gonna have overheads and various other costs to uh take uh from uh from that to give you your profit margin per unit . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> possibly i'm think i'm not sure but i'm seeing a little bit of space around maybe the joystick area which could be used . um . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i was like <EOS> like i said before i i think we should have the r_r_ on the uh on the top function button . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> hey . <EOS> and we th need to promote our company more , <EOS> so we need to somehow include our colour and our company slogan on the remote . <EOS> we're trying to get our name out there in the world . <EOS> okay . <EOS> and you know what teletext is ? <EOS>
what's special and unique about a scroll ? <EOS> uh well i don't <EOS> yeah it's i i just see it as different . <EOS> i don't say it's specially mm <EOS> it's cool . <EOS> i don't say it's special . <EOS> uh i say that it's different i <EOS> what i'm looking for as marketing is m give me something different . <EOS> i give me a lower price , <EOS> give me a higher price , <EOS> give me some new technology , <EOS> don't give me the same thing that everybody else is putting out there on the shelf it's f at the same price . <EOS> i need something to market about this thing . <EOS> we're we're a new firm . <EOS>
personalise your remote . <EOS> we could leave that to the cover department . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> we all know they've got nothing to do all day . <EOS> okay . <EOS> why can't i see the <EOS> crazy . <EOS> um yeah i talking about the interface concept and how the customer relates to , will use the , consumer will use the actual device . <EOS> um so i've looked at some of the stuff i was sent , um , try and get some inspiration . <EOS> but keep in mind that our own ideas that we had . <EOS>
i mean you bu well som you get com you get combined t_v_ and videos don't you ? <EOS> yeah . if yeah <EOS> and if you got if you got a sky box , they have one of those plus boxes , you can record straight off the t_v_ anyway so on to on to like the t_v_ hard drive or so . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> um just connecting this . <EOS> are we getting i <EOS> you don't have to worry about screwing it in just <EOS> there you go . <EOS> really ? <EOS> okay . cool . <EOS> okay . so i've got a very quick uh <EOS> uh . <EOS> okay . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> and the power is basically a factor of that . <EOS> um and the lower components , the power , the logic , the transmitter , and the infrared , um they affect you in terms of the size of your device , <EOS> um and that would have some inte impact on how y i think more how you hold rather than um the actual use using the the remote control <EOS> because um like we've said we've defined , like we only want the basic things that to be visible , and the rest of them we try to hide . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> um yeah , i think i it might even exceed it um . <EOS> but i guess there is a kind of a shortage of buttons . <EOS> um <EOS> i'm gonna give it a two . <EOS> two . <EOS> two . <EOS> and what about uh you , brian ? <EOS> you will go for one . <EOS> okay . <EOS> uh for me personally it is everything fine , <EOS> it may be having good design , it may be uh meeting all the requirements of the customers like technology-wise , price-wise , <EOS> but there is one thing which limits the customers , <EOS> like we are having only two , three designs , <EOS> like we are having one banana design and the other one is orange , <EOS> and <EOS> uh yeah , lower end . <EOS> and the third one is what you ge uh that is not a f fruit look . <EOS> but if a person doesn't like banana , or orange , you are limiting him . <EOS> no , don't buy our product , because we are l we like this only . <EOS> so we are showing our preference for particular fruits , <EOS> two or three kinds rather , <EOS> and <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so . <EOS>
yep . <EOS> okay , so here is my presentation about technical function design . <EOS> i will talk about different components and s of system and how they react together . <EOS> okay , uh , first what is a remote control ? simply it's a device , as you know , for uh , for sending some commands by some waves to uh another device to to tell different commands uh with this device . <EOS> and the main idea we don't use any cable and we can rec react simpler with the device . <EOS>
here's the project finance <EOS> uh which , of course , we all have to think about when we design this thing . <EOS> um selling price is supposed to be twenty five euro . <EOS> uh profit aim for the company is fifty million euro , <EOS> the market range unlimited meaning international <EOS>
oh . <EOS> get great popularity for our product . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> but <EOS> um wel <EOS> what's the function ? <EOS> yeah f for loading up uh the batteries <EOS> . <EOS> yeah <EOS> you could load up the batteries , <EOS> you could um insert the find the lost remote control function in there . <EOS>
then you should have a button which should which ca which can be used for increasing or decreasing the volume . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> then , there should be a button which can give subtitles for a particular program which is going on a television . <EOS> for example , if you are watching a french program and you would like to have a subtitles in english , then there should be a channel which can trigger this mechanism in the television so that the user can see uh the the subtitles on the screen . <EOS>
uh kick off . <EOS> oh working design i got it . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so we can go for the look-and-feel of the the left example , and then a screen on top of it . <EOS> here you go . <EOS> alright how do i uh skip pages ? <EOS>
right . <EOS> do w <EOS> well , then we could <EOS> if we have the speech recognition then we can start aiming at a like another kind of more handicapped disabled uh demo demographic . <EOS> mm . <EOS> well , th there's the people who desire speech recognition , there's the different demog demographics have different desires , <EOS> i don't know if you guys ge <EOS>
what they're looking for . <EOS> and negotiate that . uh . <EOS> yeah well it is <EOS> and we'll discuss the trade-offs in between <EOS> um so yeah <EOS> specific instructions will be sent in your email . <EOS> but i think that that is more or less a good place to start for now um <EOS> and as more things come up we'll have meetings <EOS> and you'll get emails and so forth . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> but uh well , i think that's a good example . <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay . well , <EOS> the working design . <EOS> the method i used is uh search the web . just the web page provided . <EOS> um basically <EOS> i'm i'm not very technical uh uh educated , <EOS> but uh i could figure it out . <EOS> um basically what happens is you press a button , <EOS> uh then a circuit gets closed by pressing the button , uh like a switch . <EOS> and by closing that certain circuit , the chip knows uh what bu button is pressed . <EOS> so <EOS> like you press a one , that circuit is closed <EOS> and uh <EOS> then the chip produces a pattern . like a morse code <EOS> to uh <EOS> and and sends that to the uh l_e_d_ . <EOS> that's the uh light emitting diode , i think . <EOS> um and the light emitting diode is uh producing infrared light . <EOS> that's un uh invisible to the human eye . <EOS> and uh transmit that uh to the t_v_ . <EOS> however it has also an uh a visible uh diode <EOS> that's uh blinking red if you look in it . <EOS> and that's uh another diode , i believe . <EOS> because infrared is not visible . <EOS> so <EOS> that's er uh do two different things <EOS> but <EOS>
in addition to that to make it sell , of course , uh the marketing manager w wishes that it be very attractive , <EOS> or like she says put some sizzle into it in one way or another <EOS> so that the people are buying it now because , in particular with smaller items , that's a very important fact , <EOS> 'cause um if they say , well , i go home and think about it , that won't work . <EOS> um also mentioned was it should be uh it should have a very short learning curve . <EOS> and maybe it could be sold by using a slogan . <EOS>
whether you want to or not , you're not gonna lose it . <EOS> so if we incorporate speech recognition into it then it could <EOS> just just to use , to find it when it was lost . <EOS> but like i said , like i don't think you'd lose something so yellow so easily . <EOS> and it's not gonna fall , like a rectangle would slip down behind things . <EOS> that's gonna be a difficult shape to <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> uh the distance uh from your television to your uh remote control has to be , uh yeah um yeah , quite a big distance . <EOS> it has to be capable for zapping uh <EOS> yeah . <EOS> from the other end of the room or something ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> uh-huh . <EOS> so where's the volume ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> the volume is is scrolling . <EOS> on the side , <EOS> this one . <EOS> yeah you just do it like this . <EOS> and and and it's it's on the back is mm cover or back lid , because if you flip it open , you can still do the scrolling here . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay um there's no restriction on the plastic , and <EOS> it can't be curved <EOS> on the wood . <EOS> so that's again , i don't think you can use them in a combination , <EOS> um especially the titanium <EOS> i i suspect they're very fixed to a particular need . <EOS> so um mixing them may not be a good idea <EOS> um yep . that's it . <EOS>
right . <EOS> right . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> right . <EOS> it's either or . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . i guess we might have to do that . <EOS> it's the only way we're gonna get below our uh goal <EOS> isn't it ? <EOS> of twelve fifty . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> so this is the easiest design the there could be . <EOS> so th an a_s_r_ decoder we can have things in . <EOS> to have different technologies . <EOS> so this was the <EOS> my personal preference was that we can have a_s_r_ sitting there on the remote control . <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
can also be on the side . <EOS> yeah , the sides maybe is good . <EOS> so that's good idea . yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> so , i mean i can pass this around if anyone wants to <EOS> yes . so it's maybe good idea . yeah , y better you pass it around with a napkin . <EOS>
colour , well uh steph's the expert on colour . <EOS> um we we don't have any particular restrictions on that . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> i think that's all we've got to say really . <EOS> i thin as for as for the fruit or organic theme , i guess this one is obviously fruit shaped . <EOS> this one has n <EOS> banana , yeah . <EOS> this one has no obvious connections to fruit , <EOS> but because it's round and molded , <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . as well . <EOS> you can make a trigger button or something like that . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> something to shoot at your television <EOS> yeah <EOS> or that that is the confirmation button or something , <EOS> that you scroll with your thumb , with the arrows , and then confirm . <EOS> that would be a nice way to use it but <EOS> i mean , yeah , i'm thinking big already , <EOS> and we need something that well that that you can able to use in one hand i think . <EOS>
i think so . <EOS> yeah , yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> well like um , <EOS> maybe what we could use is a sort of like a example of a successful other piece technology is palm palm pilots . <EOS> they're gone from being just like little sort of scribble boards to cameras , m_p_ three players , telephones , <EOS>
okay . <EOS> and u_i_d_ , it's for the user interface designer , <EOS> yeah ? <EOS> that's me . <EOS> okay , <EOS> and marketing expert , it's me . <EOS> ami yeah project . <EOS> so <EOS> i will manage all all the group . <EOS> you will be the manager yeah <EOS> .
and where where are you from ? <EOS> estonia . <EOS> . <EOS> uh then in the in the conceptual design stage i need to um come up with uh interface concept <EOS> and then in the last um stage i will be responsible for the int infa for the user interface design . <EOS>
right , like amazon . <EOS> in fact , we should sell through amazon , <EOS> don't you think ? <EOS> or ebay , yeah . <EOS> yes . <EOS> or ebay , or <EOS> yes . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> there's an idea . <EOS> going with um <EOS> yeah , that's a good idea . <EOS> to impro more profit and uh <EOS>
okay , <EOS> we're gonna get to know each other a little bit . <EOS> so um , <EOS> what we're gonna do is start off with um let's start off with amina . <EOS> um alima , <EOS> sorry <EOS> , alima . <EOS> um we're gonna do a little tool training , <EOS> so we are gonna work with that whiteboard behind you . <EOS> um introduce yourself , <EOS> um say one thing about yourself <EOS> and then draw your favourite animal <EOS> and tell us about it . <EOS>
children and everybody , yeah . <EOS> yeah of course that we can do , <EOS> but specifically if y if like elderly people want big buttons then you can't really make a bi big remote controller so maybe specifically you can design a big con remote controller for elderly and for children , like in a different you know . <EOS>
but w like just normal light ? <EOS> oh that's true . <EOS> i mean i w i w uh <EOS> that idea that i thought <EOS> um just on the basis of like ridding them of batteries and that kind of bother <EOS> is having a , <EOS> mm . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> no . <EOS> oh that's quite funny . <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay . so , starting again , one point one ? <EOS> one . <EOS> say two . <EOS> three . <EOS> two . <EOS> okay , one point two ? <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> why is that ? <EOS> right . <EOS> okay . <EOS> could it be an on off thing ? <EOS> like if you want it on <EOS> yeah . <EOS> um , <EOS> but what i'm saying is that we're we're trying to lock ourselves into a s particular kind of technology , <EOS> rather than focusing on on exactly what are the features that we're gonna say , and then , you know , say speech recognition is good for this , speech recognition is not good for this . <EOS> so maybe we should <EOS> i suggest that we think about speech recognition , <EOS> anyway it's a it's something that can be used to fulfil a function , <EOS> but at end of the day we don't look at the technology , but we look at the function first . <EOS>
um . <EOS> uh we haven't really talked about uh the curvature of the case . <EOS> there's flat , <EOS> there's single-curved <EOS> and there's double-curved . <EOS> um . <EOS> i'm not exactly sure what these things look like . <EOS> mayb <EOS> maybe curves give it like the slightly more aesthetic feel ? <EOS> but the double curve wouldn't require us to perform miracles with the plasticine . <EOS>
yes . <EOS> are raised , mm-hmm . <EOS> right . <EOS> or have two hands to operate it , yeah . <EOS> mm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yes , <EOS> and it sort of sticks up <EOS> so that you really <EOS> you don't have to g first go like oh yeah here it's on and yeah , mm-hmm . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> okay . <EOS> alright , okay . <EOS> the board working again , is it ? <EOS> the user requirem i think . <EOS> do we have the uh the marker for the board ? <EOS> uh . <EOS> um . <EOS> thank you . <EOS>
okay , <EOS> so i'll make a note on l_c_d_ . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> we could maybe also c um incorporate petre's idea of the um slider for the volume , with the channel . <EOS> so we c you could quickly just through many channels . <EOS> for the channels , perhaps . <EOS>
oh sorry s <EOS> at oh dear . <EOS> that's that's already got its stand that one . <EOS> that's it stand . <EOS> it does also lie flat , <EOS> but that's the that yellow stand there represents the the charging stand . <EOS> um the black on the back is the slogan . <EOS>
just one . <EOS> okay . <EOS> electronic simple chip on print , and we'll need one of those . <EOS> uh uh yeah , i think we can do it all with simple <EOS> just checking that . <EOS> yeah , simple , <EOS> 'cause we've just got push buttons , <EOS> so we can do it all with simple <EOS> which is the ch should be the cheapest . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> um and and i presume we can miss out the functions really to to a video or d_v_d_ remote control , if this is only gonna be a , you know , satellite , cable , t_v_ t_v_ only . <EOS> remote control . so these are two models of existing remote controls . <EOS> uh the one on the left
mm . <EOS> i think one of the very interesting things that came up in um uh ka kate cat cat's uh presentation was um uh this this issue of uh uh like voice recognition being more popular with uh younger people . <EOS> so if we need to have a target group um then uh i think as far as the m motto of our company is concerned , if we want to have something sleek and uh you know , good looking uh we are better off targeting a younger audience then um you know , people who are comparatively elderly . <EOS> um . <EOS>
that's right . <EOS> i i i have a tendency to agree with you . <EOS> i really do . <EOS> that's why i say i quest i q i question the marketability of the product . <EOS> i really question where we create the demand . <EOS> so we really can't chase that . <EOS>
do you wanna <EOS> can this can this pl reach ? <EOS> can this plug come across ? <EOS> no . <EOS> no . no . <EOS> probably not , actually . <EOS> so why don't i just pick up and move then . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> here , i'll just <EOS> why don't i just <EOS> mm er , can you go up behind me ? <EOS> kinda this is so this <EOS> i'm all in a knot now . <EOS>
a banana . <EOS> it kinda makes you think sort of organic , touchy-feely , kiddie , <EOS> it's more like <EOS> yeah , <EOS> you'd expect it to be like a child's sorta toy remote control instead of a real one , <EOS> which i quite like that sort of image . <EOS> 'cause it's very big and chunky and child-friendly <EOS> and <EOS>
mm . <EOS> so we should maybe we should assume that i t it's just a television that we're wanting to control . <EOS> well , <EOS> i mean i suppose it would be nice to have playing and record and stop buttons on it for the video recorder as well <EOS> i i don't know if that works technologically or not . <EOS>
maybe not . <EOS> anyway , <EOS> this is the the plan for today's meeting <EOS> is um firstly just to introduce the project briefly , <EOS> um although i'm sure you've actually got some of the information already . <EOS> then the main purpose is to so that we get to know each other a little bit more . <EOS> um then we want to practice using some of the tools that we'll be using during the the course of the design project and the meetings , <EOS> um specifically the whiteboard over there . <EOS> um then we need to go through the specifics of our project plan um <EOS> and discuss <EOS> come up with some preliminary ideas about it . <EOS>
relevance of two out of ten , <EOS> yeah . <EOS> vol volume , <EOS> yes um <EOS> th <EOS> w we need to s identify things that people actually need <EOS> and and it's a function of frequency and relevance . <EOS> and um i would say ignoring ig ignoring power for the moment , <EOS> um the channel and volume <EOS> and th w w given given that we've been told to ignore teletext . <EOS> uh channel and volume are the only ones that <EOS>
okay . <EOS> so . <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay , never mind . <EOS> okay . <EOS> of the remote control . <EOS> so it will be interesting so i could show you some some picture of what is inside <EOS> and so . <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS>
um i dunno . <EOS> well does anyone wanna talk about fruit more while we still have time ? <EOS> any other ideas for <EOS> what what's the end ? <EOS> are we are we supposed to um <EOS> you supposed to write a report ? <EOS> or we ending ? <EOS> is that the end ? <EOS>
is it plugged in prop <EOS> it's working ? <EOS> okay . <EOS> it's working . <EOS> excellent . <EOS> cool , okay . <EOS> so what i have , wh where i've got my information from is a survey where the usability lab um observed remote control use with um a hundred subjects <EOS> and then they gave them a questionnaire . <EOS> um so it was all about , you know , how people feel about the look and feel of the remote control , you know . <EOS> what's the most annoying things about remote controls <EOS> and um the possibility of speech recognition and l_c_d_ screens in remote control . <EOS> not that they actually gave me any answers on the l_c_d_ screens , <EOS> so i should have taken that bit out , <EOS> but anyway . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> actually i want th <EOS> one thing i would say <EOS> i mean something that could perhaps be part of the product mm the um m product testing market research process would be to uh produce mock-ups of both versions <EOS> and see just how much of a difference the over going over-budget <EOS>
are we supposed to do this right now , do you think , or ? <EOS> i would i would guess so . <EOS> or <EOS> yeah . i don't know . <EOS> you've lost uh your microphone there . <EOS> oh . <EOS> technical problems . <EOS> i mean you designers are meant to come up with these sort of things . <EOS>
yeah but y how <EOS> you need to know i <EOS> i if if this is a channel one . so it c it could be channel two , channel three , channel four , channel five . <EOS> so change . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i think something that <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> and we have the company logo here <EOS> and this will be the infrared here <EOS> and this'll be the power point , the on off button kind <EOS> yeah . <EOS> the l_e_d_ . <EOS> oh . okay . <EOS> i'm sorry . <EOS> what was the <EOS> where's the l_e_d_ ? <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm , <EOS> yep . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah <EOS> it's not very tangible . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm , <EOS> mm-hmm , <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> tangible . <EOS> okay uh <EOS> mm . i don't know if there's anything else we needed to discuss . <EOS>
oh <EOS> i think um florence resolved it by <EOS> i if you do f_ uh f_n_ f_ eight again , it's it'll <EOS> do it again . <EOS> f_ eight again . <EOS> keep doing it until you get it in both <EOS> you get it there , <EOS> you get it yours without that one , <EOS> and then you get it with both . <EOS>
but then we should move to another target b because at twenty five dollars , <EOS> it's <EOS> means th yeah twenty five euros is yeah , that's right . <EOS> well this is what we need to find out . <EOS> can we can we increase the the price point of this remote control ? <EOS> 'cause otherwise we need <EOS>
sorry ? <EOS> oh . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so <EOS> i think as everybody knows uh i'm the uh industrial designer . <EOS> and uh in this presentation uh this group presentation um is gonna focus on the working design of the the remote control . <EOS> um i'd like first to give a quick a very simple introduction , how does it work , <EOS> so that everybody knows even if you don't have a very uh technical background uh what is it because i think in the product it is important . <EOS>
you have to you have to <EOS> because some fat people with d thick fingers will press three buttons at same time . <EOS> yeah they have thick fingers . <EOS> but if you wanna make it in international , <EOS> japanese uh people got uh rather small hands <EOS> yeah true , <EOS> but <EOS> yeah , <EOS> we have we have the zoom option , <EOS> right ? <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> the the main problems with the <EOS> well you could go for wood <EOS> but i think it would be a bit impractical . <EOS> titanium um very expensive just to process , <EOS> which to make it is expensive , <EOS> and rubber , <EOS> well you're saying that people like this uh spongy feel this year , <EOS> so perhaps uh some something made of rubber , <EOS> but i was thinking more of the buttons , <EOS> because the buttons which they've they've said <EOS>
so that it will record okay . <EOS> um uh um traditional kitty cat . <EOS> fat , a fat cat . <EOS> i've a very fat cat . <EOS> and it likes to sit like that . <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> and you're francine , right ? <EOS> would you like s like just to see um how it feels , so that you have a little idea ? <EOS>
um yeah , i think you can just draw the face , <EOS> but then you'll have to describe in writing how the rest of it looks . <EOS> ooh . <EOS> it's a cat . <EOS> which also has what ? a big fat body and <EOS> that's a very pr pretty cat . <EOS>
just long . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> black usually . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> lot more modern . <EOS> i think so . <EOS> maybe sorta spherical or something . a ball . <EOS> maybe like user-friendly , <EOS> like a little <EOS> yeah . <EOS> you know , <EOS> where you can use both hands , like a little keyboard type thing . <EOS>
do we go for maybe a remote contro <EOS> uh sorry , <EOS> we're gonna go for a remote control obviously , <EOS> do we go for a small joystick that would operate say changing channels , up and down , <EOS> and then , what , another button that would say that it's now being used to manoeuvre round the l_c_d_ . <EOS>
um , can i do next ? 'cause i have to say something about the material <EOS> hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> which is quite shocking . <EOS> ha . mm . <EOS> right , um , i have been searching the current trends , um , both on the web and via fashion-watchers , <EOS> and the findings are that the first thing to aim for is a fashion uh , fancy look and feel . <EOS> um . next comes technologic technology and the innovations to do with that . <EOS> and th last thing is the easy to use um factor . <EOS> um , fancy look and feel goes far beyond the functionality of the thing , <EOS> but i suppose that is included in in the ease of use . <EOS> um , our fashion-watchers in milan and paris have decided , well noticed , that f the fruit and vegetable theme is the is the current trend <EOS> and and therefore um we need to go for that if we want , you know , wh whatever our motto is . um . <EOS>
yes . <EOS> okay , <EOS> because uh especially today , you know , you have the family and the kids , <EOS> okay , <EOS> and the kids throw it <EOS> and they they play with their remotes <EOS> and . <EOS> run over it with a car . <EOS>
yeah , <EOS> just where you're around something . <EOS> li <EOS> yeah , <EOS> we had one example . <EOS> but we have to make contacts on the on the remote control and the recharger as well . <EOS> mm . mm . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> but that's a round one . <EOS> maybe we can choose then . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> so , <EOS> hope you have good ideas . <EOS> i don't . <EOS> um we're work we're working uh from top to bottom . uh functional design , <EOS> then we do some in individual work , <EOS> then we have a meeting to discuss the results , etcetera etcetera . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> well <EOS> i i suppose that things become design . <EOS> but i mean i <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> i was trying to think of like the design of others . <EOS> i can't think of anything other than a long rectangle for remote , <EOS> maybe small , sort of fatter ones , <EOS> but there's nothing being done sort of out of left field , yeah . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> um , <EOS> so i guess i guess that's it . <EOS> that's the meeting over . <EOS> whoohoo . <EOS> great . <EOS> then we get to go find out what was picked up for lunch for us . <EOS>
um <EOS> and as we say we n we don't wanna be too ridiculous with the fruit things you know . <EOS> yeah , . <EOS> but yeah , about the speech thing , it doesn't have to be hand held or close . <EOS> it can sit at a distance and pick it up still . <EOS>
so <EOS> which one are we talking to ? <EOS> mm . <EOS> are you talking about this or that ? <EOS> well <EOS> either of them . <EOS> oh <EOS> yes , we are talking about , <EOS> but they have the same shape , <EOS> but , actually bu <EOS>
sure , yeah . <EOS> oh they're a bit clunky . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yep . <EOS> clunky , okay . <EOS> um <EOS> mm . <EOS> having to tick it before you go off was a bit hindering as well , <EOS> 'cause you're half way through a thought , and then you run out of paper and then you have to jump . <EOS>
just <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay <EOS> um right well wouldn't it <EOS> we do need to make a decision on whether we want to incorporate a jog dial in nice and quickly . <EOS> um i'm all for them actually , <EOS> i think they're quite you know th very quick to m to use . <EOS> so does anybody oppose the idea of of incorporating one into the design at all ? <EOS> no . <EOS>
yes . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah yeah . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i s i suppose um <EOS> if people are buying remotes , then they're probably buying it to replace another remote <EOS> 'cause all most tellies come with remotes , so . <EOS> i mean we're maybe talking about replacing remotes for slightly older televisions , <EOS> so we maybe need to keep the the tuning function in . <EOS>
just uh press uh <EOS> yeah . yeah . <EOS> the keys yeah ? <EOS> alright . <EOS> um yeah well i was working on this before i got my information . <EOS> so i was just working off the top of my head and using my colin common knowledge about uh remote controls . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> the flat one . yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i didn't <EOS> yeah . <EOS> but like if if you just squash them flat like and you made it flat <EOS> well if they're that s uh stress ball stuff they would be pretty squishable . <EOS>
that i would believe . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> but um yeah i think we we need to compromise between those two and somehow we'll do that . somehow . <EOS> um so the the what i would propose is something more or less in the uh direction of what is to yo the right of that slide uh <EOS> but without with a l a less complicated um design , <EOS> so the numbers , the volume control , and channel control , and teletext access . <EOS> uh the volume and channel control can just become those the the four button array as in if it was a round dial . <EOS>
si simplicity and fashion . <EOS> i think simplicity , fashion . <EOS> simplicity and fashion . <EOS> yeah mm . <EOS> okay , <EOS> those are very good goals , i think , <EOS> um that we have to keep in mind in with everything we do . simplicity and fashion and , yeah , or usability <EOS> speci <EOS> however you wanna say that , <EOS> which includes um an emphasis on making the infra-red very functional , <EOS> so that you don't have to travel around a lot . <EOS>
right . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> right . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> um okay this finding things is a little bit confusing , <EOS> so i'll go into the diagram first . <EOS> it just explains how the process goes through , <EOS> from a <EOS> from the basic technology point of view , <EOS> the basic steps that you need <EOS> um in the diagram and in this slide probably works better . <EOS> um okay , <EOS> you need some power source . <EOS> 'kay , a battery or something , to keep it going . <EOS> um and that power source is important <EOS> because it ties you down to um how long the device will last . <EOS> um it ties you down perhaps a bit later on in terms of the technologies <EOS> um how far you can transmit the signal <EOS> or the complexity of the functions that you want . <EOS> like for example , voice recognition , right . <EOS> that might be constrained because that you might need to power a microphone , <EOS> you might need to power other things , <EOS> so that's one perhaps constraint there . <EOS> um <EOS>
yeah . mm . <EOS> yeah . yeah . <EOS> or do we s make sure that it goes to the man through the manufacturer ? <EOS> we sell to the manufacturer as the remote that goes with it . <EOS> right , good point . yeah , yeah okay , yeah . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> right . well <EOS> we were we were talking about that a little bit <EOS> when we got that email <EOS> and we think that each of these are so distinctive , that it it's not just like another piece of technology around your house . <EOS> it's gonna be somewhere that it can be seen . <EOS> so we're we're not thinking that it's gonna be as critical to have the loss <EOS>
okay , so then if we use double curved case , then we have to u choose rubber push-buttons , <EOS> and that's fine ? <EOS> yep , <EOS> but <EOS> we're going for the simple buttons . <EOS> so rubber rubber keys , yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> and it's cheapest all round , <EOS> it sounds kinda funky , <EOS> and we can also market it <EOS> as i 'cause we were s saying earl <EOS> you were saying earlier in your research that um the the people have the r_ people were getting the complaining about r_s_i_ , and this is anti-r_s_i_ . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> and you would just have an <EOS> across the b you would have so many different options that you could do , <EOS> you could have um a plain black one , you could have sparkly pink glittery ones for your little <EOS> well the thing is the rubberised covers are going to be s relatively cheap to produce , <EOS> that if in a year's time we we get feedback from the design fairs that show something else is coming i mean it's so easy for us to just produce that and it can be slipped on , <EOS> which is another beauty of it . <EOS>
so you think maybe a little too controlling or <EOS> yeah , oh yeah , without without a doubt . <EOS> i think controlling is not the right word , <EOS> i think the interactions are very structured . <EOS> i think structure is probably what you're saying that , each individual is structured to one particular task , and one parti rather than controlling . <EOS> i don't think there's a sense of control 'cause all the decisions have been made in terms of a , like a consensus right , we go around and we think about it , <EOS> but that you know process actually says you have to do it in a certain way . <EOS> it doesn't tell you , you know , some ways that you might wanna be a bit more creative in terms of the process you know , not the <EOS>
well <EOS> i think compared to say just pressing buttons . <EOS> yep . <EOS> advanced , like three eight six advance . <EOS> if you press a button that sends a certain transmission through the infra-red , <EOS> whereas i think if we're controlling the l_c_d_ we definitely require a much more powerful chip . <EOS> just compared to the chip you would use for pushing buttons i think is the the point being made . <EOS> if i've not over-stepped . <EOS> yeah ? <EOS>
purple . <EOS> just draw slowly , <EOS> because otherwise it won't work . <EOS> it's a very nice elephant , you can see . <EOS> i dunno what it looks <EOS> but it doesn't matter . <EOS> looks very nice . <EOS> i just h <EOS> something like this ? <EOS> oh no <EOS>
that will be the volume control i think which which a user shou it it should be already pre-defined . <EOS> it should be whatever will be the case , the chip is always going to be sitting inside . <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah , but the speaker , if the speaker is actually on the chip , then if it's too far away from the the casing , or if the casing is too thick , then you may not hear the the speaker . <EOS>
industrial design . <EOS> marketing expert . <EOS> what's your talk ? <EOS> marketing experts . <EOS> okay . <EOS> mm . <EOS> and after that we uh will have the uh new product requirements , <EOS> the decision on the remote control functions , <EOS> and we will close the meetings after . <EOS> mm so
yeah . <EOS> and this can allow to choose the the program , for instance without uh adding uh buttons <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so it's a good idea . <EOS> it's not going to take much space also . <EOS> it's going to be very slim . <EOS> and next one was the size of the remote control . <EOS> it has to be of course a very slim and small one . <EOS>
signal . <EOS> receive . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> multi-purpose . <EOS> yeah well that's already been eliminated by management , so we're off the hook . <EOS> yo and it's <EOS> yeah <EOS> but it's so . <EOS> uh yeah . <EOS> um . <EOS> yep . <EOS>
and uh <EOS> who would be next , uh , <EOS> i guess that would be you . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> you want me to get your slide show up ? <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah 'kay . <EOS> yeah yeah sure . <EOS> thank you . <EOS> and you are number three ? <EOS> number two . <EOS>
oh , one thing that we've almost not talked about at all , <EOS> my apologies for that , <EOS> um , user interface , we also need to maybe get the slogan in here , <EOS> um it's , <EOS> i'm pointing at my laptop , <EOS> what in god <EOS>
i don't know . <EOS> i i thought it was uh easier to handle this way , <EOS> but i don't know what they think . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> sorry ? <EOS> would you like the the buttons horizontal or v vertical ? <EOS> mm . <EOS> for sound and channel . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> simple rechargeable uh batteries . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> um what was with the chip on print ? <EOS> the chip on print ? um <EOS> uh you gotta f <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i think so . <EOS> chip on print with a with a simple uh a sim not a simple but a <EOS>
uh-oh , we have a good artist . <EOS> that is really good . <EOS> i'm quite <EOS> thanks . <EOS> this is my <EOS> oh , <EOS> very shapely . <EOS> okay . <EOS> that's a sketching of my my elk , <EOS> and it , it is my favourite animal right now , 'cause it is a large beautiful majestic creature , <EOS> that um , that um <EOS> in a way it looks kind of awkward , because it's on spindly legs <EOS> and it uh <EOS> but it can really overcome harsh terrain , <EOS> and although it's gorgeous it's also very dangerous , because it has um strong antlers , <EOS> and uh <EOS>
push buttons instead of the wheel ? <EOS> yeah . . <EOS> if it's rubber , isn't it malleable anyway , <EOS> it doesn't matter if it's double <EOS> i mean isn't a rubber case , mean it's completely flexed , i mean , it it flexes to whatever they want it to ? <EOS> mean so what's the difference between a normal rubber case and a rubble doub double rubber double curved case ? <EOS>
no , well no <EOS> 'cause you wouldn't have to you don't actually have to press them you just <EOS> you don't have to press it , <EOS> you just have to put your thumb onto it . <EOS> um , think that might appeal <EOS> i'm thinking kind of japan , <EOS> i'm thinking uh young , um office people , <EOS> trendy kind of a thing . <EOS>
'kay . <EOS> um , can we just go over that again ? <EOS> sure . <EOS> uh , so bas at twel <EOS> alright , yeah . okay . <EOS> so cost like production cost is twelve fifty , <EOS> but selling price is is that wholesale or retail ? <EOS> like on the shelf . <EOS>
'cause it could b it could it could be that f <EOS> it could be that functionally that doesn't make it any better , <EOS> but that just the appeal of of not having <EOS> you know , these days there's a r pe things in people's homes are becoming more and more like chic , you know . <EOS> um , nicer materials <EOS> and might be <EOS>
you know you could you could do it yourself actually . <EOS> oh . <EOS> did you send it ? <EOS> save it in the project documents . <EOS> okay . <EOS> put it in project documents , <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm-mm-mm . <EOS> this one ? <EOS> okay . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> um yeah <EOS> i've seen that before too . <EOS> anoth another like b <EOS> it flips up <EOS> and then you've got another layer of buttons underneath . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yes . <EOS>
which was that ? <EOS> up the numbers , or the up down ? <EOS> god , i wou i would say that's required , <EOS> i mean there's no way anybody's gonna buy a remote control these days when if you can't actually individually select channels , <EOS> i mean would anybody disagree with that ? <EOS>
i dunno if i should go with this . <EOS> oh it's okay . <EOS> thanks . <EOS> if it is enough line . <EOS> i'm sorry . <EOS> maybe put it up <EOS> put it a maybe put it on the desk or something . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i should get used to the tool , so . <EOS> oh just wait a little bit . <EOS> c could we put it here , to make it as straight as possible ? <EOS> ah probably not . <EOS>
is that your lapel then ? <EOS> there you go . <EOS> uh , yep . <EOS> thank you . <EOS> uh , maybe you can guess what i'm trying to make ? <EOS> a kind of dog ? <EOS> yep . <EOS> it's actually sitting , so <EOS> it's sitting , it's not standing . <EOS> okay , i see it as one thing it's very supportive . <EOS>
yeah , yeah . <EOS> so te textu textures , yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> vegetable textures and all this kind . <EOS> drawings of bananas . <EOS> uh <EOS> yeah , yeah . <EOS> okay and <EOS> uh-huh . <EOS> but what's your suggestion how we can have some shape like that on the remote ? <EOS>
you it . <EOS> i mean , we have a option in the remote control . <EOS> if we want to have that option , you press that button in the remote . <EOS> okay . <EOS> oh right so <EOS> okay , do you want to have a conceptual remote control there , <EOS> or you just want to put the function in ? <EOS> go on , draw something . <EOS>
twelve and a half euros is what supposed to cost us . <EOS> okay , so <EOS> it's too much . <EOS> well let's see . <EOS> the f the <EOS> um <EOS> wonder if i can make this <EOS> uh <EOS> what the <EOS> oh it won't let me do that . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> mm-hmm . mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm mm mm . okay . <EOS> that's good point . <EOS> mm , yep . <EOS> mm . okay . <EOS> 'kay ? <EOS> okay . <EOS> so um <EOS> now i think it's the turn of the the i'm not sure um <EOS>
yeah , looks like it . <EOS> and i'll i'll give you the uh , i guess , technical considerations for those . <EOS> mm . <EOS> uh <EOS> and i'm gonna use the whiteboard , <EOS> just 'cause we haven't used it . <EOS> yeah , i was just thinking the self same thing . <EOS>
yeah that's an excellent idea . <EOS> mm yes <EOS> wh when you make a a design ca you can next meeting you can give an quite an exact cost price . <EOS> that w that would be a very good idea . <EOS> yeah yeah . yeah <EOS> because right now i don't have price in in head <EOS> but for next meeting i'm sure yeah be able to do that . <EOS>
so <EOS> for anybody need uh any help , for time being , on this uh subjects , okay , so please come back to me , <EOS> and uh christine , maybe i can uh try to help you to get some uh the technical uh the companies <EOS> to help you for uh make a design uh slim , <EOS> okay , <EOS> and to add some features , like we are talking about , the speech recognition and all . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> well , i think it's the the remote control conforms to the the company strategy . <EOS> is that the question ? <EOS> okay . <EOS> is it ? okay . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> yeah . <EOS> um . <EOS> okay , so <EOS> one or two . <EOS> one . <EOS> okay , just leave it , it's fine . <EOS>
yeah <EOS> not telling that you are young . <EOS> li li like a teenager for instance . <EOS> no , it's i . i would buy <EOS> okay <EOS> you're you're crazy teenager and you like fun things . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> you want to flaunt . <EOS> you with your girlfriend or something . <EOS>
yep . <EOS> okay , i think that that's doing it now . <EOS> nope . <EOS> try that again . <EOS> uh , again ? <EOS> think maybe the the wire in the back might be loose . <EOS> wait . <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah , you wanna <EOS>
okay . <EOS> okay ? <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> all right . <EOS> here is what the functional design is supposed to achieve . <EOS> um . <EOS> that is it's gonna be individual work and then at the meeting we'll discuss what uh we have come up with . <EOS> the same goes for the conceptual design , <EOS> there will be individual work whic and then discussion afterwards . <EOS> detailed design , same thing basically . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> but sure surely that would have to be um sort of specific rather than above a threshold 'cause if you had a loud movie on you're likely to get it beeping back at you . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> oh yeah , yeah , that's true . <EOS> well maybe you could have a <EOS>
okay . <EOS> so can we use any any frequency ? <EOS> we have the right to use any frequency ? <EOS> yeah , it should be okay . <EOS> uh no <EOS> but as i know , there is a range for uh for this uh f for for uh for this stuff , for designing this circuit . <EOS> we can we can we can tune our uh transmitter to work in this range , <EOS> and for this range we don't need to ask any permission . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> uh according to the coffee uh machine example , i have batteries to supply energy , <EOS> and we ye use button presses to activate or deactivate certain functions on the t_v_ . <EOS> and that's basically all i have so far . <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
true . <EOS> 'cause it would have a docking base ? <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> but then again that costs as well . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so <EOS> these new lithium batteries they last twenty years even with the touch screen ? <EOS> do they ? <EOS> okay . <EOS>
yeah yeah . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah we should also optimise the the number of buttons . <EOS> well i i i i think that j just by using navigation buttons and the user interface on the screen we are able to uh navigate uh through the well channel programme or contents or in an easy way , so <EOS>
just just switch them . <EOS> bit complicated . <EOS> it'd be nice if everything was wireless , wouldn't it ? <EOS> okay . <EOS> right . <EOS> um . so i can i can say already , <EOS> i dunno whether this is for good or for bad <EOS> but there'll be a lot of kind of uh redundancy in the in the the issues and the the uh the things . <EOS> yeah , yeah . <EOS> which is ma not necessarily a bad thing , <EOS> but may <EOS> what i've already started doing is cr i created a slide in in my presentation here <EOS> so um <EOS> so that we kind of think well what's the cumulative effect of what we've taken from your ideas and and mine , <EOS> because certainly i i have a hard time separating separating things completely . <EOS> obviously obviously what you've just told me what you've just told me impacts a lot on what um like market research mm that that i've been <EOS> so how do i how do i get this up ? <EOS> okay . <EOS>
okay . alright . well um , we'll alright let's <EOS> what we're gonna aim to get together by the next meeting then um <EOS> is <EOS> from you catherine wi your y y you know you're gonna be working on the the look and feel design . <EOS> yep . <EOS>
no , a wheel is better . <EOS> i would say the wheel is better . <EOS> what is the expert of uh <EOS> yeah . <EOS> because of that <EOS> yeah . <EOS> because it's uh it's it's not like a volume which is smooth yeah ? the channels change one by one . <EOS> so you have to <EOS> the user has to like to should feel the the the discrete sense a bit . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm , that's cool . <EOS> okay . <EOS> um <EOS> and what else was i thinking of that i haven't written down and therefore fallen out my head , <EOS> programmability . <EOS> glow in dark . <EOS> uh <EOS> if it's not too expensive s i think it's a good gimmick . <EOS>
and we can decide if that's what we want , , um if we want to include that on the remote , if that's something that would stay on the t_v_ itself , for example . <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> these are two examples . <EOS> um and you can see on the left , it's got a lot more buttons , <EOS> and i don't know if you can read it , but it says , step , go to , freeze , um slow , repeat , program , mute , <EOS> and so those are some of the buttons and so it gives you an idea of s one example . <EOS> and then on the right , it's a lot more simpler , <EOS> it's got volume , it's got the play the like circle set , which is play , rewind , but it's also what is fast-forward is also like next on a menu . <EOS> so you have functions that are d uh duplicating . <EOS>
so technical function . <EOS> the working design is the structure . <EOS> yeah , yeah . <EOS> what is technical functions exactl <EOS> i i don't really know what <EOS> um , i guess you'd have to find out . <EOS> it says on that email but it <EOS> um . <EOS> it was in the email . <EOS> i wrote down what mine were . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> mm . <EOS> very cheap way of changing the look of it and people can just buy a new one if they want to . <EOS> t <EOS> yeah . <EOS> well that's been really popular with mobile phones so i don't see why not . <EOS> mm . yeah . <EOS>
one , two , three , four , five , six . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay . we'll come back , if we can , to the rubber being added <EOS> at the moment , that's where we are . <EOS> interface button push button interface . that's what we're using , <EOS> isn't it ? <EOS>
that's a very valid point . <EOS> did they s <EOS> do we have to use an advanced chip for the l_c_d_ ? <EOS> okay . <EOS> well <EOS> that's yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so if we're gonna go with the l_c_ display , then that's <EOS> what's a hand dyna dynamo ? <EOS> you have to wind it up ? <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> that's fair enough , yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> okay so <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> so w what's our reviewed suggestion ? <EOS> um take away the l_c_ display ? <EOS> yep . <EOS> and the advanced chip goes away as well . <EOS>
if if <EOS> i mean , uh <EOS> i'm sure if the user pays the same price , he's happy to have recognition . <EOS> but if if if it like doubles uh <EOS> more features , <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , but <EOS> i think he need a control that is very reliable , <EOS> so . <EOS>
three . <EOS> three . <EOS> uh <EOS> which one ? <EOS> hmm . <EOS> mm <EOS> mm uh have a look at this no it's <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> uh so <EOS> the concept of the interface . <EOS> generally i developed quite a broad concept not only for the interface , but for possible instruction or user's manual and uh all the complex things that come together with your t_v_ and remote controls . <EOS> so let's start with this . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> mm . <EOS> bottom perhaps <EOS> yeah . <EOS> maybe we could sketch a <EOS> so basically <EOS> all of our remotes all of our typical remotes now are just kind of a rectangular sort . <EOS> you know . um <EOS> maybe we could flare it or something . <EOS> you know . <EOS> so it's more <EOS> of course this will look like a bone then . <EOS> go ahead and erase this . um <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> from everyone to see how she best could market uh this this product at the within the budget uh that was given . <EOS> uh in general the idea is that it should be something that is not difficult to use . <EOS> um it's also an item that people lose a lot . <EOS> so we should address that . <EOS> and , of course , it should be something s s that is very simple to use . <EOS>
okay , okay . <EOS> so you can control if you want , right ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> alright and that's it for the working design . <EOS> so if you have any questions ? <EOS> no . <EOS> mm . <EOS> okay , and how about the battery power ? <EOS> uh you mean that battery would be somewhere there and the remote contro the power to the battery comes through infrared ? <EOS>
okay . <EOS> uh there's different scale , <EOS> so you can you can choose how much do you want to sc <EOS> okay . <EOS> but this this has to stay on the table , right ? <EOS> this has to stay on the table . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS>
right . <EOS> one point three is <EOS> so it's a one was true and seven was false ? <EOS> okay , so you guys really didn't like it ? <EOS> huh ? <EOS> uh . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i really <EOS> oh i thought it was the other way round . <EOS> so we do have about the same thing , we just have it the other way <EOS>
yeah mm . <EOS> uh you were finding out about teletext . <EOS> if you could find out that uh <EOS> yeah . <EOS> totally , it takes cheap speech recognition , <EOS> she they wi <EOS> um i think we're gonna scratch the speech recognition as a bit of a <EOS>
no . <EOS> mm . <EOS> i would greatly advise not to do it . <EOS> i think that would be better to uh insert in our other product , that is meant for the <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> younger people . <EOS> uh is it possible uh to make um changeable uh case . <EOS> so um uh <EOS> you 'cause <EOS> uh yeah <EOS> with uh mobile phones uh uh so uh like the nokia mobile phones , uh when you can change the case of it . <EOS> so <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> oh you were only given red and black ? <EOS> oh okay . <EOS> yeah so <EOS> not very sleek <EOS> and we don't wanna go for black because most remote controls are black or grey . <EOS> so we want it to be stand out that way , anyway . <EOS>
but both <EOS> you press the button it makes a noise <EOS> right ? <EOS> it turns into a duck and starts quacking . <EOS> here i am . <EOS> um <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> you could s <EOS> yeah . <EOS> oh , that would be brilliant . <EOS> i'd be tempted to <EOS>
hmm . <EOS> okay . <EOS> mm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> okay . <EOS> so , maybe you can talk about the function , and <EOS> okay . <EOS> yes . <EOS> i have only a couple of things because i had i struggled a bit with the software that i'm supposed to use in this uh uh in this company . <EOS> i was used to use linux before , so . <EOS> but i tried to tried to break through this too , i guess . <EOS> mm . ah . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> the problem is we have a limit in a month of time , so we cannot do something very new . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> so let's go for a small l_c_d_ . <EOS> so <EOS> okay , so <EOS> yeah , so so just just give me the the the five by ten numbers that you find the best and send it me <EOS> and i will work it out . <EOS>
yeah . . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> this company has its its fingers in a lot of different pots . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah , we're definitely not in the money making department . <EOS> . <EOS> well i i did notice looking at <EOS> i mean , they told you that they wanted whatev our product to represent the the r_r_ brand and and to be immediately noticeable . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> so that , you know , you get a bit round feeling . <EOS> um we'll use hard plastic . since that allows us to use uh two d_ buttons , uh non-rubber buttons . <EOS> colour changeable . <EOS> well and um the backlight thing , the thing that lights up . <EOS> we have decided uh in the the channel buttons , there's a little uh colour around it . <EOS>
what but <EOS> what's that button ? <EOS> not do it at all . <EOS> it's a quick on-off button . <EOS> that's um <EOS> just the on and off . <EOS> uh , 'kay . <EOS> yeah i think it's pretty important . <EOS> so you don't have to fiddle with that . <EOS>
okay , cool . <EOS> the num-pad . <EOS> and the logo is over here , and the mic . <EOS> okay . <EOS> and the scrollwheel , no ? <EOS> you operate that with your pointing finger . <EOS> so you hold it like this in your right hand and <EOS>
mm-mm . <EOS> no . <EOS> 'fraid not . <EOS> afro beat orchestra ? <EOS> very cool . mm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> sounds nice . <EOS> wow . <EOS> exciting . <EOS> that'd be . <EOS> oh . <EOS> i didn't even read those . <EOS> oops . <EOS> i shouldn't admit that . <EOS>
yes , <EOS> and as john reece said the buttons can be , uh can me we can use the fluorescence to light up the buttons so different uh buttons will glow differently . <EOS> so in even in the dark the user can know what buttons to use to switch on a particular channel . <EOS> and uh uh the design of the uh um remote should be in such a way that there should not be any sharp projections <EOS> so that if a child plays with a remote , he uh he should not be harmed in any way . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah , but <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay , before we get too far off here um , <EOS> the components of the concept is the energy . <EOS> what kind of energy do we foresee ? <EOS>
so for the power source , apparently you still you you want to use both solar cells and batteries . <EOS> oh yeah that's right . <EOS> uh you mean <EOS> okay . so <EOS> i don't really know if the solar cells are actually necessary any more if you have a recharging base station . <EOS>
yeah , okay . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm . <EOS> everybody is okay , six . <EOS> six or five . five . <EOS> six is okay ? <EOS> six , yeah , for me . <EOS> six . <EOS> yeah . okay . <EOS> s <EOS> now um so . <EOS>
better to draw with a with <EOS> than on the , with <EOS> yeah , <EOS> i m i mean like uh like on here , drawing drawing uh . and then displaying on screen , but <EOS> mouth . <EOS> oh , okay . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> w with this paper it's too mu too expensive . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> okay , next one . <EOS> uh team work <EOS> um the <EOS> the third meeting i think that one was pretty hard . <EOS> we were not all we were not um agree with every not agree with . <EOS> we're not finished . <EOS> yeah yeah . we were not finished . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah mm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> but we can talk a little bit more potentially in the marketing marketing presentation about this . <EOS> be a good idea . <EOS> uh sorry , i didn't mean to cut in . <EOS> i'm not the boss . <EOS> okay . <EOS>
oh the the beeper thing . <EOS> . <EOS> but it can be yellow as well . <EOS> it can come in the same colour as the the case . <EOS> it <EOS> 'cause we we won't have run out of our pot of play-doh . <EOS> yeah , i think jen wants it to vibrate . <EOS>
did they not have they didn't like uh mine <EOS> yeah <EOS> they didn't come like this ? <EOS> like with <EOS> this was what it looks like . <EOS> this is what that looked like , <EOS> literally , just like that . <EOS> interesting . <EOS> like with those words already on it ? <EOS> no . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> okay . <EOS> do we have um whoop . <EOS> okay . <EOS> ki some idea of how much it would cost to create a device that has these basic elements ? because then <EOS> isn't that your job ? <EOS> oh . <EOS> no , <EOS> the chip composer marketing . <EOS> oh no , <EOS> the chip composer sender . <EOS>
uh s so if d <EOS> okay . <EOS> ooh , we like rubber , ooh . <EOS> people . <EOS> and then there are the push-buttons , <EOS> so you can have basic push-buttons or a scroll-wheels , like you have on a mouse , <EOS> um or you could have um l_c_d_ , which gives you a display . <EOS> um scroll buttons , as well . <EOS>
f_ eight . <EOS> f_ eight . <EOS> is it doing <EOS> dunno . <EOS> uh , give it about twenty seconds , or so . <EOS> okay . <EOS> ah , <EOS> there we go . <EOS> oh yeah , <EOS> it's going . <EOS> oh okay . <EOS> okay , so <EOS> this is just about the technical functions . <EOS> so <EOS> the method , i looked online for examples of other similar products <EOS> and then just kind of was trying to brainstorm some possible design ideas <EOS> and um identify what the necessary things are , what people are what you really wanna have a remote control do . <EOS> um and then there are two different kinds that i found . <EOS> there's a user centred one and an engineering centred one <EOS> which i will have pictures of <EOS> and then we kinda have to decide which one this should be . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> um . so you know , as we said , we got the outer casing , <EOS> which we have to decide , you know , what's it gonna be , <EOS> um the board we have to use basically uh the same set-up , <EOS> processor , um we'll probably use the more advanced processor than they had , <EOS> amplifier and transmitter are all standard . <EOS> um so for the casing , uh this an e-mail i got from our manufacturing team <EOS> uh , you know , we have a bunch of options from wood , titanium , rubber , plastic , whatnot , <EOS> um latex , double-curved , curved . <EOS>
it's not a possi it will not be possible to implement it for the next prototype , <EOS> so t it's in the next prototype <EOS> so let's skip it . <EOS> uh . <EOS> okay . <EOS> for the future prototypes . <EOS> yeah , maybe , <EOS> for the n if if if it it works well , we'll go for uh an orange one . <EOS> yeah yeah , honour the fruit . <EOS>
of what to do . <EOS> mm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> uh-huh , <EOS> that wasn't very much . <EOS> you know <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yes . <EOS> mm , mm . <EOS> hmm , <EOS> very much so . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> that was fun . <EOS> i think the most helpful thing out of everything was getting the the powerpoint slides already put together for you <EOS> 'cause if we didn't have that there's no way we could have got all that done in time . <EOS>
then , in that case <EOS> i i we can't do it . <EOS> oh yeah well , but then those people we can't help everybody . <EOS> i mean it could be on <EOS> well , i if it were like on top of your bookcase and you usually kept it on the coffee table <EOS> um , <EOS> you know ,
i don't think so . <EOS> if we have any questions we'll just email you i guess . <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah i think it pretty much everything's covered . <EOS> okay . this one was quite easy . <EOS> coulda been worse . <EOS> still . <EOS> always the optimist . <EOS> 'kay thanks guys . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> nope , <EOS> they've identified the product as not working for anything but televisions . <EOS> they've identified this product limita <EOS> that's why i say i don't i don't see the market niche for this . <EOS> if we if w if we were going to have a product that worked for d_v_d_s , v_c_r_s and everything , then i can see the market niche , <EOS> but we we're only identified as going for televisions without teletext . <EOS> and it's like whoa we ha in my opinion we have to go with something that's extremely exclusive to make this thing marketable , <EOS> because who wants just a television remote ? <EOS> i don't . <EOS>
. <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> right . just kind of the squishy feel . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> which is the next big thing , <EOS> so that's not gonna hurt us either . <EOS> mm 'kay . <EOS> yeah <EOS> let's see if we can do a squishy non-remote control-looking remote control . <EOS> but to be fair , yeah , i mean , you just c you could just put it literally put it on the the ni the coffee table next to the telly and say volume up . <EOS>
b b <EOS> okay <EOS> but uh it won't use uh much e energy uh i i believe . <EOS> uh it's uh just a small display <EOS> so i believe uh it will run on one battery for um six months or f or or more . <EOS> so i believe one battery uh is just enough . <EOS> uh so <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so what do you think would be the price , it would be out of range ? <EOS> or it would be maybe feasible ? <EOS> yeah , i'm <EOS> oh . <EOS> i was not thinking too much about the price . <EOS>
um , for things like remote controls , um , they stamp out a chip , <EOS> calculators too i think . <EOS> um , so you can mass produce 'em pretty cheap . <EOS> but it's not like a computer , you can't like reprogramme your remo remote controls , it's like stamped onto the chip . <EOS>
yeah , <EOS> and also it's it's um other question is uh because there are so many different and there are so many different things that could possibly be included <EOS> because besides video and d_v_d_ there are the mm um video c_d_s and whatever , <EOS> so it might be problematic to to choose between all these possible things . <EOS>
i i <EOS> every home's got to have it . <EOS> if you don't have one , <EOS> hey what kind of remote do you have ? <EOS> oh you've got one of those , <EOS> oh fantastic , <EOS> i want one of those too . <EOS> i just don't have enough money right now . <EOS>
so <EOS> we are here to talk about functional design . <EOS> now hopefully we've all got a better idea from than we did f leaving the last meeting as to what it is we are up to now . <EOS> so here's an agenda . <EOS> uh i'll open . <EOS> um you should know that i'll be taking minutes during all the meetings , <EOS> as i was struggling to our last time uh <EOS> and that'll be easier for me now because i'm not actually giving the whole presentation . <EOS> uh the additional points are just the stuff that we sent and that i forwarded on from upper management having a few bright ideas to make our lives painful . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> i uh i i i don't think it's worth it though , <EOS> i think it doesn't really add much to the functional design and it's it's it's not mature enough to use as a speech recognition engine , so <EOS> okay . <EOS> um , yeah . <EOS> so if we can just move on to the next slide , <EOS> i've just done a quick mock-up of uh uh some of the features of our potential funky-looking uh remote control <EOS>
well . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> or the room for <EOS> it was the idea to be creative , <EOS> so <EOS> there was room for <EOS> yeah . <EOS> you got some standard ideas in your head <EOS> and this what came out . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> and you get get stuff from the from the computer , <EOS> but <EOS>
nah , <EOS> i think we can say with certainty now that we are supporting teletext . <EOS> but i do think there are some basic features that we don't have that a lot of other remotes are going to have . <EOS> yep , <EOS> one one thing i don't understand is h they've they've given us this package , okay . <EOS> now uh in my opinion we need to give them a package back , okay . <EOS> they say they say okay here you go . <EOS> they gave us a fundament a foundation of of what they want , <EOS> and and w it's our place to kinda analyse and evaluate . <EOS> i don't think it's our place to create their product for them , <EOS> maybe it is . <EOS> i don't know what kind of role we have in this in the corporate ladder uh , <EOS> but to me it's like , okay , you have got your here's our ideas , okay . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> uh could put it at one or two i would say . okay . <EOS> yeah . mm . mm . mm . mm . <EOS> personally . yep . <EOS> so what is it , what are the innovations with this ? <EOS> got the l_c_d_ screen . <EOS>
hmm . <EOS> i mean you might be able to sway me on the idea that we our main selling point could be already this voice recognition thing <EOS> i mean that's what sets us apart <EOS> right ? <EOS> i mean <EOS> which , it's <EOS> yeah <EOS> that's what setting us into this young market , <EOS> i mean that's where we started from , so <EOS> i don't know , <EOS> and i mean you know <EOS> perhaps when the cell technology comes down in price we can bring that back into the game <EOS> but it looks like at this point that may be out of our league . <EOS>
okay , so hmm . <EOS> what did what else we have to discuss about ? <EOS> i dunno . <EOS> think we need to work uh thirty minutes again ? <EOS> yeah , <EOS> we have to care that it r uh looks really new . <EOS> because uh we still hold on to the uh ordinary uh uh square uh remote control . <EOS> 'cause wha what i see the only difference i i i in fact is that we use a scroll-wheel on the outside . <EOS>
yeah , <EOS> it's it's all on one level . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> on one level . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> i know what you mean . <EOS> so <EOS> we have to keep it on the one level . <EOS> like th the top it's <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm yes . <EOS> yes . <EOS> uh you can also see the uh uh the green two green things are uh these are they are they are resistors , <EOS> and uh just beside that you can see a transistor , <EOS> and a uh uh cylinder shape , uh that one is a capacitor . <EOS> uh and also there are uh um resistors <EOS> uh sorry , ther there is a diode . <EOS> can you go go on to the next slide . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . good . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> oops , <EOS> sorry . <EOS> you used to have all the buttons <EOS> um yeah and um uh <EOS> the material which we are going to use for the case is uh plastic <EOS> and uh w which which is s strong <EOS> um uh and also uh for the <EOS> um the material is plastic and uh for the buttons it is uh s soft rubber <EOS> um and als <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah because uh uh you'll be touching the buttons more so it is soft when you touch it . <EOS>
yes . yeah . <EOS> yes . <EOS> mm . like what ? <EOS> like internet on the on t_v_ ? <EOS> yeah <EOS> i_p_o_ or . <EOS> now we are looking for <EOS> mm . television things or i_p_ . <EOS> for example personal video recorder and all those stuffs are coming up . <EOS>
yeah , but mm like when you push it <EOS> n n <EOS> yeah . <EOS> you have your finger over the button . <EOS> so you can see <EOS> yeah . <EOS> or or m maybe on top of the a green light is flashing <EOS> or <EOS> yeah , <EOS> then then won't then you won't see it . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> so , uh , so today we are doing a short meeting to present the project , <EOS> so um we are gooding <EOS> we are going to present the tool we are we are going to use during all this project . <EOS> we are talking about the project plan , <EOS> and we are going to to discuss about st our first ideas and so on , <EOS> and , yeah . <EOS> so we have around twenty five minutes to do this meeting . <EOS>
right here . <EOS> ah , okay . <EOS> g i started making stuff up , then i got an email saying mm . <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay , <EOS> this is a brief run through of the um of the technical functions of the remote . <EOS> as um is uh the the <EOS> the presentation is uh already slightly obsolete <EOS> because i had in mind something that would uh be i be aimed at controlling multiple devices <EOS> but uh there's still stuff of relevance , <EOS> so <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> wheel on the top . <EOS> button , where do we want some buttons ? <EOS> well , <EOS> usually hold <EOS> 'kay , we want it to be good also for the left-hand users , <EOS> right ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> uh <EOS> so it have to it has to be symmetrical . <EOS>
go for it . <EOS> right on . <EOS> w <EOS> um . <EOS> right now i'm listening to a lot of somebody nobody's ever heard of , chris bathgate , <EOS> local michigan folk singer , <EOS> really lame <EOS> and uh <EOS> mm . <EOS> nice . <EOS> wow . <EOS>
s <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay . let's go ahead . <EOS> so we we st only have one for battery . <EOS> uh then for electronics um so i didn't put anything for the . <EOS> so we have the regular chip on the print , which is one .
and if we don't get this space then what happens ? <EOS> so w uh if i if we don't get these ? <EOS> um , well basically they are promised to us so uh <EOS> do do you think there are chances that they take from us one of the rooms or uh <EOS>
. left . now , that we've discussed <EOS> okay . <EOS> do you want me to run it or you wanna <EOS> okay . <EOS> i can go . <EOS> yeah , you should run it . <EOS> functional requirements . <EOS> 'kay . <EOS> mm yes . <EOS> alright . <EOS> now we have courtney with the functional requirements . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> and uh it was really a pioneering innovation , <EOS> but it was uh sensitive to the sun , <EOS> so that uh it would get would start off by the you'd get <EOS> it would easily cause um problems . <EOS> so , uh <EOS> i in addition to uh looking at the um uh the functional requir <EOS> so <EOS> all these devices are examples of where uh mm they represent examples that are available today <EOS> which i think the one in the middle is r um really uh something to keep in mind . <EOS> it'd be easy to find . <EOS>
i couldn <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> and uh i think if this this new software for the sound recognition is the microphone <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> so should the microphone be just anywhere on it or <EOS> i would put it sort of sub-centrally , so it's <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
mm . yeah . <EOS> but is it useful or not u <EOS> well , uh <EOS> i don't know . <EOS> there is in the <EOS> i mean , for a lazy guys they could say nine and the nine channel comes . <EOS> or they say movie name <EOS> or i don't go for movie names <EOS> but only for the numbers on the channel , or volume up , volume down , brightness , contrast . <EOS>
yep . <EOS> mm . <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> right . <EOS> right . <EOS> um there might be one other consideration which would be that the the transmission between the remote control and the t_v_ for example . <EOS> okay , um are we gonna restrict ourselves to using the traditional technologies of infra-red thing ? <EOS> because that's something you need to actually be physically be pointing to . right . <EOS>
nobody saw it , honestly . <EOS> the cameras did . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> is that you all have all finished , or <EOS> yeah that's that's me . <EOS> i did have one other um one other frame i thought , <EOS> i mean i i d not knowing how we would deal with this information , <EOS> i thought okay in theory this kind of a process would be about refining our design , revisiting our original goals . <EOS> it's not something i need to p push through , <EOS> but i thought should we thinking more about the dimensions , um sort of like more of a three dimensional shapes as well as opposed to just that flat um <EOS>
okay ? <EOS> good afternoon . <EOS> hope you have good lunch . <EOS> afternoon . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> we had falafel . <EOS> hi . <EOS> oh . nice . <EOS> and you ? <EOS> uh , yes , i had something similar but non-vegetarian . <EOS> okay . <EOS> so today is um our third meeting . <EOS> it will be about the conceptual design uh . <EOS> if i come back to uh the minutes of the last meetings <EOS> um . we decided not to go for speech recognition technologies because of some reasons <EOS> and we are not decided about u the use of l_c_d_ screen on on the remote control because of costs . <EOS> so maybe we cou wi will be able to clarify this this question to today . <EOS> uh at the end of the meeting we should take decision on that point . <EOS> so i hope uh that your respective pr presentations uh will help us . <EOS> so each of you have some presentatio presentation to perform <EOS> um who starts ? <EOS>
does anybody have any ideas of about how we can fit all that in together ? <EOS> i mean that's kind of the user interface type of thing , <EOS> what are your thoughts on that ? <EOS> um i think we could go for like um maybe not a p a fruit shape but a very sort of curvy type shape . <EOS> um you could have the same sort of texture and colour as a fruit . <EOS>
no . <EOS> okay , so that's good . <EOS> that's me done . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay , cool . <EOS> um <EOS> as to where we're going from here , you're going to look at the components concept . <EOS> yeah ? <EOS> whatever that means . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> y <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah i know <EOS> i d <EOS> it seems like it would suffice to have just the r_r_ on there . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah you would think . <EOS> but . <EOS> jus <EOS> but apparently not . <EOS> so . <EOS>
mm-hmm hmm . <EOS> if i can . <EOS> i think it's just t_v_ , <EOS> i mean , if it if we're taking it just new product a new television remote control that's not like doesn't say . <EOS> mm yeah . <EOS> you know , things might be more advanced than that . <EOS>
it ha <EOS> . <EOS> the children's story . yeah i've got it . <EOS> yeah but that's that's the the problem uh yeah the dilemma actually , <EOS> 'cause we wanna appeal to the to the young public with fancy with flashy colours , and with a lot of shape . <EOS> and <EOS>
um . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> but like radical good , maybe . <EOS> okay . um <EOS> don't know how lo much longer we've got . <EOS> at least five minutes i think . <EOS> um quickly we'll pop onto project evaluation . um . <EOS> so , <EOS> we've got these uh four criteria here for uh satisfaction . <EOS> does anybody want to um um do you have any opinions on any of them ? <EOS> for example um we'll work backwards i suppose . <EOS> the ability to work on this project using the technology we've been presented with . <EOS> um people made good use of the uh pen and paper ? <EOS> i would say <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> i'd say six , <EOS> 'cause the i mean the the standard layout for numbers is three three three and one , rather than the way you've got it . <EOS> i really like the way you have it , <EOS> but it's not the immediate thing that you're used to . <EOS>
uh you can make a if you make a drawing . <EOS> uh <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . aye yeah . <EOS> uh . <EOS> shall i uh <EOS> uh black's okay . <EOS> and draw it very big . <EOS> oh . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . it's okay . <EOS> no , it doesn't have line control , so <EOS>
ah okay okay . okay . okay okay . <EOS> mm uh <EOS> okay . <EOS> i see . i see . okay . okay . <EOS> and this is the uh the infrared uh port . <EOS> that's right . <EOS> also the top of the banana . <EOS> so . and then we have <EOS> in the uh in the base station we have the the button at the front for uh for calling the uh the banana . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> but then you don't want to make the l_c_d_ display too complicated at the same time . <EOS> mm . <EOS> two t_v_s . <EOS> i mean there's always we can always have these l less often used functions hidden somewhere , <EOS> under a cover or at the back of under a slide or some <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah , no kidding . <EOS> no kidding , yeah . <EOS> mayb maybe they already expected something . <EOS> so , <EOS> if we put an inflated price of fifty euro at a production cost that cannot exceed twenty-five euro , <EOS> okay , we're already in that that price , okay , <EOS> with transport , promotion , labour , because we hav gi included the promotion in the cost , transport for the material to the stores or whatever how however we're gonna break this down between our our retailers . <EOS>
with a back-up battery ? <EOS> with the ba okay . um <EOS> and <EOS> the voice recognition area actually doubles as uh as the solar cell area . yeah . <EOS> clever , clever , <EOS> well done . <EOS> um so i guess that would mean we've got a bit of a um <EOS> it's a s a speaker and a sensor at the same time <EOS> isn't it ? <EOS>
advanced chip . <EOS> uh <EOS> well <EOS> that's very easy . <EOS> we already have uh the beeping of the home station , <EOS> so <EOS> yeah , <EOS> and i do i don't know anything about that . <EOS> i d i didn't receive any information on speech recognition , <EOS> so <EOS>
mm mm 'kay . <EOS> is this for the next meeting though ? <EOS> i think we might be out of time out of time for this meeting . <EOS> we should make a <EOS> mm . yeah <EOS> that yeah next meeting we should be <EOS> okay . <EOS> ju just make two designs ,
yes . <EOS> rechargeable with a docking station . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> so the rechargeable which would be your yeah yeah th yeah that that'd be fine , <EOS> and also that would mean they wouldn't have to go out buying batteries all the time . <EOS> field . okay . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> no , <EOS> not quite . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> what about the digital pens , did you find them easy enough to use ? <EOS> yep clunky . <EOS> agreed . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . yeah , mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> uh-huh . <EOS> does it take long to learn to use ? <EOS> shouldn't . <EOS> no , not at all . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> and uh , <EOS> what else ? <EOS> the r_s_i_ compares to the current standards , <EOS> well . <EOS>
uh-huh . <EOS> okay . <EOS> i'm sure we'll have by the end of today . <EOS> i'll give it another go . <EOS> yeah , there we go . <EOS> right , <EOS> we've done some research into the functional requirements that people want out of their remote control . <EOS> and first off we should state that th the remote control's for controlling the t_v_ <EOS> and um how do people use it ? <EOS> we asked them sort of which buttons were useful for them . <EOS> um how d how does a remote control look and feel for them , <EOS> and what improvements would would they like to remote control . <EOS> and we did that by sort of giving them a questionnaire that we'd prepared and asking them to fill in the answers . <EOS> and three quarters of them found that remote controls are ugly <EOS> and that a sort of even higher proportion would spend more for a sort of s uh a fancier remote control <EOS> and that of all the buttons on the remote control , the sort of setting buttons for sort of the picture picture and brightness and the audio settings , um they weren't used very often at all . <EOS> people concentrated on the channel buttons and the volume buttons and the power buttons . <EOS> uh we also asked them about speech recognition uh for remote control . <EOS> and young people were quite receptive to this , <EOS> but as soon as we got sort of over about into a thirty five to forty age forty five age group and older , people people weren't quite so keen on speech recognition . <EOS> there's a lot more th there's a lot lot more older people who didn't know whether they wanted it or not as well . <EOS> um we also asked what frustrated people about remote controls <EOS> and the number one frustration was that the remote was lost somewhere else in the room and that they couldn't find it . <EOS> and the second second biggest frustration what that if they got a new remote control , it was difficult to learn um all the buttons and all the functions , and to find your way around it . <EOS> okay , so <EOS> my personal preferences from the marketing is that we need to come up with some sort of sleek sort of good looking high high-tech <EOS> a design which looks high-tech , basically . <EOS> um and that we should come up with fewer buttons than most of the controls on the market , <EOS> and we should sort of concentrate on the channels and sort of power , and also volume and that sort of thing , as as louisa said . <EOS> um we could maybe come up with a menu , a sort of a an l_c_d_ menu for other functions on the remote control . <EOS> that's worth thinking about . <EOS> um and maybe we could think about speech recognition as well , <EOS> because um sort of young people are perhaps the ones that are gonna buy buy our new product if we aim it at sort of you know sort of a high-tech design . <EOS> that that might be the market that we're we're looking for . <EOS> and we could maybe think about using speech recogniti recognition as a way to find the remote control if it's lost in a room , rather than sort of um having it to speech recognition to change the channels . <EOS> 'cause there's a problem with that in that the television makes noise , <EOS> so it could end up talking to itself and changing its channel . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> well <EOS> why not ? <EOS> or yeah . <EOS> that's fa that's fancy . that's uh fashion . <EOS> but it looks cheap as well , <EOS> because it's a small thing . <EOS> it's only twenty five euros . <EOS> it looks very cheap if you make it <EOS>
i i think uh the batteries will be uh a little <EOS> yeah , okay . <EOS> uh maybe . <EOS> uh oh , <EOS> maybe it's it is would an e no . just uh <EOS> empty . <EOS> no , <EOS> we have a recharger in it , <EOS> so <EOS>
would some <EOS> pla <EOS> maybe you <EOS> i think we can have wood for example in the bottom and , you know . <EOS> it depends on the design we want , <EOS> so . <EOS> yeah , maybe the base . <EOS> it's it's natural . <EOS> but still y <EOS>
yeah . yeah , maybe . <EOS> kind of a c <EOS> yeah , <EOS> you'd want it narrower than a mouse though <EOS> 'cause it a mouse you're kinda just resting on it , <EOS> you want something you can definitely grip . <EOS> so maybe it'd be <EOS> w it <EOS> i mean well <EOS> it's sort of it's it's sort of uh a a mouse , <EOS> but held , you know , <EOS> so it's you sorta hold it in your hand like that , i with , you know , and fiddling with the buttons . <EOS>
well <EOS> for example <EOS> yeah , i think so . <EOS> like for for example you can uh you can category the function i i into several classes . <EOS> then for um you can have a switch menu , <EOS> so you put the switch menu to it it tend to this kind of this category of functions . <EOS> then you you put the switch button , <EOS> then it <EOS>
mm . <EOS> right , <EOS> particularly in technological fields , <EOS> so that's exactly where we're headed . <EOS> mm-hmm , mm-hmm . <EOS> okay . <EOS> um . yeah alright , well , more or less covered what we need to cover i think <EOS> fi an an <EOS> any final thoughts before we think about doing the protot moving on to the prototype . <EOS>
uh , i don't think it will be too much . <EOS> could you answer please ? <EOS> okay . <EOS> have to think about the question , <EOS> you know , <EOS> 'cause it's i think that you know you can always you know <EOS> okay . <EOS> i think wha wha with the wire it's mm cheaper <EOS> but you know the wireless it's more practical , so . <EOS>
this is <EOS> i don't think it's part of the remote control design anyway . <EOS> it's maybe more in browsing . <EOS> maybe not , <EOS> but mayb <EOS> yeah , <EOS> but this this mean that your t_v_ would be able to , you know , connect to internet , you know , surf the web . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> in states we don't have it , <EOS> but um it's like they just have this channel where just has news and weather , kind of sports , <EOS> it's very um bland looking , <EOS> it's just text on the screen , <EOS> not even <EOS> yeah , <EOS> just black with just text . <EOS>
yeah <EOS> i think <EOS> sorry . <EOS> no it's just if i i see the the f the rate i think it's better to do it without l_c_d_ . <EOS> because that's with l_c_d_ just will increase the price , <EOS> and i thi i they have the same rate so without l_c_d_ it will be <EOS>
so i found two very good prototypes for for this interface from our competitors <EOS> so can you <EOS> this are usual functionality . <EOS> yeah , yeah , yeah . <EOS> ours is a bit uh different . <EOS> so these are two example . <EOS> one is from <EOS> the other one is from , yeah , uh engineering centr yeah . <EOS> this is the most competing prototypes i've found . <EOS> but then uh loo but then i found if you look at you see on the left one there are too many buttons <EOS>
okay . yeah . <EOS> okay so the buttons are on top here , and you flip it over that way . <EOS> yeah <EOS> or preferably even keep the simple buttons here , and then under the screen even you could put more more advanced buttons . <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
um i mean that sounds like quite a good requirement to me . <EOS> um conventional battery would seem to make sense . <EOS> um i'm not sure if there's any cost differences between single and double curved <EOS> and i'm <EOS> i don't know about anybody else , <EOS> but plastic or rubber as a traditional form of casing would seem to be a good way forward ? . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> th thank you . <EOS> very interesting . <EOS> guillermo you want to ? <EOS> 'kay <EOS> i dunno why , but when i was a child i i wanted to be a a panther <EOS> not a pink panther , <EOS> or maybe yes . <EOS> but don't you think it's very difficult to draw a panther ? <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah , i mean <EOS> if i'd had more market research on the fruits and vegetables , maybe we could've taken that into account . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> but the fruits and vegetables , they really my creativity , so . <EOS> i know , i really did , <EOS> the the whole mango idea was great . <EOS> no , <EOS> i mean <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> the three important things of refa are uh from th of this year is are , <EOS> is the remote control fancy enough , <EOS> sorry , <EOS> you used the powerpoint <EOS> yeah . <EOS> is it in innovative enough , <EOS> and is it easy enough to use . <EOS> and then evaluation itself . uh . <EOS>
yeah , that would be my guess as well . <EOS> so they don't <EOS> well <EOS> these guys are growing up . <EOS> what about just from the the prospective of our manufacturing cost ? <EOS> i mean if if it's twelve fifty per unit . <EOS> i mean , okay , there's <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> in uh <EOS> in about five minutes . <EOS> uh oh , <EOS> export . <EOS> well , <EOS> i think we'll be a bit a bit longer , <EOS> but <EOS> okay . well , <EOS> happy celebration , huh ? <EOS> ah . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah <EOS> i i dunno <EOS> i think it was quite good that we had time limits on the meetings because they really could have run on <EOS> and like my experience with meetings is that they really do , and you can spend a lot of time talking about <EOS> the only thing is though like when we had our meeting about the conceptual design , i thought there maybe another fifteen minutes would have been useful there <EOS> but um yeah . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> mm , okay . <EOS> i think that's a cost thing , <EOS> i don't i don't know how much we're gonna know about <EOS> s <EOS> y <EOS> it might <EOS> it might save a b bit of space , <EOS> it's i instead of looking bulky , it might look small . <EOS> but it might have its cost implications . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> shall we sh <EOS> well we'll stick to kind of your area for now . <EOS> which which is the clunky one , the one on left or on the right?. . <EOS> um , the clunky one is the one on the right . <EOS> okay . <EOS>
hmm . <EOS> 'kay . <EOS> findings . <EOS> fifty percent of the users lose their remote often . <EOS> so we don't have to make it very small , like uh like a mobile phone or something , <EOS> but some somewhat bi bigger than small , <EOS> so you don't lose it that much anymore . <EOS> seventy five percent of the users also find it ugly , <EOS> and fif seventy five of the users zap a lot , <EOS> so the buttons sh should be that small , <EOS> or shouldn't be that complex <EOS> because we have to search for the buttons , which one are you going to use . <EOS>
oh . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so it always means , whatever the rays goes by they they get reflected and then you are having a better coverage . <EOS> it's like antennas . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so . <EOS> but yeah that's um that's just like <EOS> that's an attractive um base station . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> b <EOS> yeah . <EOS> alright , so we're just gonna have the the rubber buttons , <EOS> was that right ? <EOS> yes yes . <EOS> hmm um <EOS> and just to be aware that there are kind of specialist functions and specialist remotes <EOS> but we probably don't want to focus on those like such as the children's remote . <EOS>
yeah , maybe two scroll wheel , as we have the coarse coarse to fine scroll wheel . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , true . yeah , yeah . yeah . <EOS> okay , yeah , yeah . scr <EOS> so , no button supplements ? <EOS> i think the price is okay . <EOS>
i really like that kinetic battery though . <EOS> next , is it easy to use ? <EOS> just so you know , easy to learn will be separate , <EOS> so don't overlap them . <EOS> i think it's really easy to use . <EOS> i'll give it a two . <EOS>
yeah <EOS> y i think it's better to <EOS> yeah yeah yeah <EOS> it'll be a banana yellow , we have . <EOS> could be ugly , <EOS> but it's definitely fancy . <EOS> r red . <EOS> but <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah th yeah . that's right . <EOS> but if you use uh silver , uh rubber s silver rubber isn't fancy . <EOS>
should i uh <EOS> alright . <EOS> so <EOS> i can draw , <EOS> but uh <EOS> uh . well . oh . <EOS> b <EOS> it's a mouse . <EOS> bunny rabbit . <EOS> a bunny rabbit . <EOS> oh wrong one . uh . <EOS> well uh <EOS> you can guess what it is , i hope . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> it d <EOS> yeah , <EOS> it depends on how organised you are personally , <EOS> but <EOS> yeah , <EOS> or like i guess what the setup of the house is too . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> but , i mean i am notorious for losing my keys , <EOS> i just <EOS> i guess i've just never lost the remote . <EOS> i put my keys in the refrigerator the other night <EOS> and couldn't find them . <EOS> 'cause i was putting groceries away . <EOS>
uh and uh then th plastic also has this problem of melting and it's brittle it gets brittle after a while , <EOS> so um we still had titanium and and wood available , <EOS> but um unfortunately uh uh titanium's also been eliminated uh , <EOS> the m people in manufacturing said that you couldn't make d curved cases out of titanium , <EOS> although how apple did it with th powerbook i'm not su quite sure <EOS> but uh <EOS> nevertheless um they've eliminated all of our options except wood . <EOS>
mm-hmm <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> so <EOS> do you think we might make that a selling point if it was something that we found we could afford to develop ? <EOS> you know f <EOS> definitely , <EOS> 'cause i'm thinking in terms of um uh mm . <EOS> the loss and breakage of um remotes , how much of that is is to do with it not really having a uh a home , a um a nest , a place to live , <EOS> exactly . <EOS> so if you can dock it , um you know , you could s argue that this is <EOS>
no . <EOS> we started with information about the cost was now th <EOS> i just i just received the <EOS> yeah , uh i have i have some some information about the cost . but just a about the chip . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> and how much is the chip ? <EOS> the the the <EOS>
using that technology . yeah . <EOS> yeah i think so , <EOS> without it being too <EOS> in fact we can cut costs through using the manufacturing that's already gonna be in place here . <EOS> a charging system . <EOS> right . <EOS> if if we can create this we have probably five or six or seven really strong marketing characteristics . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> mm yeah . <EOS> sorry <EOS> y y yeah , <EOS> if i can interrupt you . <EOS> well <EOS> d p <EOS> 'kay , <EOS> do you wanna say anything about um slide controls ? <EOS> i mean i think the reason everybody uses pushbuttons is that they're they're si simple , cheap and reliable . <EOS>
hmm . <EOS> and uh they are bad for r_s_i_ <EOS> but uh i don't remember what is r_s_i_ . <EOS> so i think they are bad . <EOS> mm-hmm . mm <EOS> nobody has any idea about that ? <EOS> well i'll check uh with my <EOS> okay uh tha that's look great . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> maybe we should design couches that have the remote control in the side arm . <EOS> yeah so we the project is now couches and remote controls . <EOS> but even just a thing to attach it to the w you know if you had a thing , a pretty object attached to the wall . <EOS> but that would really make it more expensive . <EOS> but it's only a plastic thing , r really , the thing on the wall . <EOS> something like that . <EOS> and the other thing is <EOS>
mm . <EOS> right . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> no uh uh <EOS> um , right , okay we've got half an hour before the next meeting , <EOS> so we're all gonna go off and do our individual things . um <EOS> i think that's probably about it <EOS> and then we'll come back and liaise again <EOS> and i get to do another fantastic powerpoint presentation . <EOS>
no . no , it's only on the number , behind the numbers <EOS> and uh <EOS> yeah , not needed i think . <EOS> and and the switch channel is uh there is a back light too ? <EOS> oh , you mean th this here ? <EOS> that as well , yeah . <EOS>
slogan , yeah . <EOS> right . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> 'cause yeah , that w more than finding it , that was more like you know if you're watching a film in the dark , you can um still see the remote control . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS>
um i've received uh a framework which we can do this . <EOS> i mean did you have this this excel sheet ? <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> no . <EOS> no . <EOS> no okay , <EOS> this is these are the the the latest prices of our production uh uh production unit for several components , <EOS> so we can uh see whether the the price is is within the twelve euro uh fifty cents uh . <EOS>
what they found was they analysed people's desires and needs . <EOS> focusing on their desires , um people specifically said that they thought remotes were ugly , <EOS> seventy five per cent of the a hundred subjects noted that <EOS> and that they <EOS> more importantly though , eighty per cent said that they would be willing to pay more for a fancier looking remote . <EOS> i don't know anything beyond what fancy means , <EOS> but that's particularly of use to us , i think . <EOS> um also they did some questions on voice recognition <EOS> and found that the desire for voice recognition was inversely related to age , <EOS> so younger people were more inclined to want something with voice recognition , <EOS> whereas the older people in the like sixty and above segment or so did not really think that they would pay more money for voice recognitions . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yep . <EOS> so that's , from a marketing perspective i i see i see a lack . <EOS> and so we have to go , i think , in the other direction . <EOS> what are we gonna have that makes this thing better than <EOS>
right . <EOS> well that's that can be down to bit of market researching you know , <EOS> if that's easy enough to find out what colours are more popular . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> and produce less of the silly colours , maybe . <EOS> mm . <EOS>
mm <EOS> mm . <EOS> yep . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i think , unless we can really drive these prices down we need to get rid of the l_c_d_ display . <EOS> okay so we can get rid of it <EOS> and then add a couple of buttons . <EOS>
so <EOS> s so we're point three over . <EOS> we're point three over at the moment . <EOS> it's nothing n <EOS> unless we just take off the scroll wheel altogether <EOS> and just have pushbuttons for the volume . <EOS> could b still put them on the side . <EOS> but yeah . <EOS> i mean the scroll wheel's pretty cool , but <EOS>
maybe , it is the outside and the inside . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay right . <EOS> but i was thinking that he's a user <EOS> 'cause the user interface to design for example where the but button will be , you know . <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah yeah . <EOS>
but we want it to be seen . <EOS> we need it to be seen . <EOS> on the back ? <EOS> it d visible <EOS> visibility though <EOS> 'cause if it was only on the back really the only time you're gonna see it is when you drop it or when you're changing the battery . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> oh ho-ho . <EOS> yep . <EOS> and the electronics , we decided on it being just a simple , the easiest thing that's inside it . <EOS> ooh . <EOS> so the case , we've gone for the double curved . <EOS> um <EOS> and it's made out of rubber . <EOS> the interface is push-buttons . <EOS> and button supplements <EOS> well they're in diff special colours , <EOS> aren't they ? <EOS> so special colours . <EOS>
chris . <EOS> christa christa . <EOS> a fish . <EOS> mm . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> smiling fish . <EOS> smile fish . <EOS> okay . <EOS> a smiling fish . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> so , w whiteboard is working ? <EOS> good . <EOS> next . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> does it have to be uh it has to be uh with different colours <EOS> or <EOS> um i dunno . different colours um <EOS> maybe we can give it out in different colours . <EOS> you can choose blue or yellow <EOS> or <EOS> it's like a imac or something . <EOS> just to make it <EOS>
remotes don't have power on off switch . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> s no , that'll be controlled by the <EOS> those buttons'll be there already , yeah . <EOS> what a <EOS> where ? <EOS> means on the remote . <EOS> on the side . <EOS> because remote is going to have both the interfaces , scroll as well as buttons . <EOS> they are not going to cost you much , <EOS> everything is in-house <EOS> and now you don't want the traditional users to be apprehensive of this . <EOS>
think of a all these young people who would love to say that this remote control only works for them , <EOS> and ha ha you cannot use my remote control , <EOS> because it's targeted to me . whatever . <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> so <EOS> can you repeat <EOS> and be more precise about what you just said ? <EOS> spongy feel ? <EOS> uh about the feeling <EOS> yeah <EOS> uh yo <EOS> you can <EOS> well <EOS> ma make it not necessar sp <EOS> spongy is the current thing . spongy is the current texture , <EOS> but basically there are no reports no remotes at the moment which are spongy or tactile at all , <EOS> so if we make it like maybe furry or soft or something , that'll be something that sets it apart , <EOS> rather than just bare plastic which they all are at the moment . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> um but um <EOS> i could check back for you , <EOS> but i don't think you can actually use them in a combination . <EOS> we you couldn't have like plastic and rubber ? <EOS> um i think plastic and rubber would be fine , <EOS> but plastic , rubber , and wood , <EOS> i wasn't i'm not very sure about the titanium . <EOS> they had some restrictions on using the rubber and the titanium . <EOS> um the rubber was a restriction on the kind of power source you could use , <EOS> but the titanium had a different kind of things on the shape of the thing , <EOS> so i think that there is some restriction on um <EOS>
but what is he uh ? <EOS> is it a rabbit ? <EOS> too expensive , yeah . <EOS> yes . <EOS> no . <EOS> do you have a rabbit at home ? <EOS> it's a rabbit with uh broken legs ? <EOS> a green rabbit . <EOS> no . <EOS>
true . <EOS> way to go . <EOS> i think it's all about following apple's lead on a lot of these things . <EOS> yeah <EOS> i'm thinking of the airport portal , <EOS> you know like that little pod looking thing ? <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> those are nice . <EOS>
'kay . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> uh then a short thing about documents . <EOS> we've got our shared folder , <EOS> uh project project <EOS> what was it ? <EOS> project documents i think . <EOS> but all you will found that already <EOS> because there are a lot of documents in it already , <EOS> so it will be okay . <EOS> and these are available on the smart boards as well , <EOS> so if you have a document you wanna show , just open it from the folder . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> what should i draw ? <EOS> snake . <EOS> i'm going to draw a snake . <EOS> how does it look like ? <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> uh , okay . <EOS> i hope the kitty cat is hungry 'cause i don't like snakes . <EOS>
is that <EOS> the button on an ipod , is it what is it , <EOS> is it just four buttons <EOS> or is it li more like a scroll thing ? <EOS> it's like five , <EOS> 'cause there's one in the middle . <EOS> it's a scroll , yeah , it's a wheel . <EOS>
uh yeah , it's very elasticy for sure . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> and that would k also give it kinda durability <EOS> and <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> um . <EOS> and ther that's also f sorta relatively cheap to cast . <EOS> um <EOS> so maybe s uh a sort of uh plastic initial plastic with a a latex kinda sheath ? <EOS>
yeah . okay . okay . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so . <EOS> and what about the number of buttons buttons uh yes but that maybe <EOS> my matthew ? well <EOS> we can just say <EOS> uh <EOS> one . <EOS> when you look at this w , this u uh item , <EOS>
yeah . yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah , i think that given the list of materials i w i was forwarded it's that seems doable . <EOS> could we go in fruit and vegetable colours ? <EOS> we could colour-co-ordinate them , <EOS> li <EOS> f for sure , <EOS> or maybe like <EOS>
uh i don't mind . <EOS> p <EOS> fine . <EOS> uh can i steal the cable ? <EOS> oh sorry , <EOS> you can indeed . <EOS> cheers . <EOS> i got a <EOS> how do i start there ? <EOS> oh , <EOS> if you click on the um uh the one that that looks like a projection screen , <EOS> no <EOS> the one to the right of that . <EOS> that one . <EOS>
well <EOS> what what's the most uh important thing at a remote control ? <EOS> um well <EOS> i think the most important thing of a remote control is that you can switch channels . <EOS> and my opinion is you should keep it as basic as possible . uh <EOS>
yeah , but do you see that as a rigid thing , or like like a banana , something very soft , you can open like banana , or . <EOS> well is it possible to make it soft ? <EOS> yeah , yeah , yeah it's a lic like a plastic cover , so . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i don't know . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> with um but with a t_v_ remote it's gonna be quite limited if we're t saying the main things people want to do is on off channel five , <EOS> an <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
so i think before we close uh , we are expected <EOS> i mean the last slide wanted us to maybe discuss longer what our what our ideas where . <EOS> i mean if you wanna go back to the last slide . uh <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
n not an expert on these things , <EOS> but presumably , there must be loads of 'em already on the market that we can modify . <EOS> but uh that that's uh that's your area of expertise . <EOS> and then the uh , you know , the the overall design of the case uh is is is kendra's field <EOS> and uh <EOS>
i love whiskers . <EOS> uh they're intelligent <EOS> and they're cheeky <EOS> and uh fantastic pets <EOS> and very friendly . <EOS> and they sit on your shoulder <EOS> and whisper the answers to your homework in your ear when you're doing your homework . <EOS> oh . <EOS> okay . <EOS> kate ? <EOS>
'kay . <EOS> and you're <EOS> s r r_e_i_s_s_ <EOS> i am reissa . <EOS> r_e_i_s_s_a_ . <EOS> double s_ a_ , <EOS> yeah yeah . <EOS> sorry . <EOS> okay . <EOS> 's just a bit nicer calling people by their names i think . <EOS> uh , right . <EOS>
no , i mean , yeah yeah . <EOS> inspira inspiration is <EOS> and inspired colour <EOS> and and very sophisticated material , so . <EOS> true . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> and so <EOS> okay , we'll see after . <EOS> we will have first to <EOS> so , mister money , what's your opinion according to this remote control ? <EOS>
yeah maybe we <EOS> okay . <EOS> i can imagine that the kinetic uh type energy source would be more expensive to make . <EOS> but it is more longlasting , that the people don't have to ever buy batteries again . <EOS> yeah . and it's more fun . <EOS>
lapel . <EOS> that's it's down , it's quite close . <EOS> you know you know what they're gonna have on the recording in there from that microphone is your lunch digesting you know th <EOS> keep it , keep it calm . <EOS> oh dear oh dear . <EOS> oh dear . no more pizza for me . <EOS> so yeah the the pen came in alright <EOS> and it's a little uncomfortable to use but i guess it works . <EOS>
yeah <EOS> but it's not reachable i think , touch screen . <EOS> and we have to care for uh the strength of the remote control , <EOS> because uh uh remote controls are most uh things in the house that falls down on the ground and it get often uh broken . <EOS>
we have we have just <EOS> yeah . <EOS> the price of selling is twenty five euros . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> and the price of production <EOS> alright <EOS> please uh go on norman with the special features . <EOS> or uh <EOS> yeah <EOS> we'll we'll come up to that , <EOS> the the the thing that makes this the controller cheap is that it is modular <EOS> so you want more function you pay more . <EOS> if you want less function i i if you want a reasonable price you pay for the functions that you add on to the system , <EOS> so is uh modular . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> right . <EOS> possibly it might be worth the investment . <EOS> i think speech recognition was uh one of those things where um they have to be really good for them to work . <EOS> 'cause sometimes you find yourself just saying things over and o if it's on your phone . <EOS>
oh yeah . <EOS> s s so um <EOS> different languages might not be compatible . <EOS> yeah , yeah . <EOS> it w it would make it quite complicated , <EOS> where um ours at least keeps it fairly simple <EOS> and then the <EOS> hmm . <EOS> hmm . <EOS>
any ideas will do that you have at this point . <EOS> could be shaped like a conch , <EOS> you know . <EOS> be like a shell-shaped remote . <EOS> mm . <EOS> can hold it . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> a novelty . <EOS> are we going into kind of novelty factors here . <EOS> like , i've seen phones like a <EOS> okay . <EOS>
you're three . <EOS> would you want it full full screen ? <EOS> mm-hmm ? okay . <EOS> i can make it full ? <EOS> yes yes yes . <EOS> okay . <EOS> as uh user interface designer i did a little research to find out what are the features which a user would like to have on their remote . <EOS> yeah can you please go onto the next slide ? <EOS> so i found out that uh but uh the main purpose of a remote is to uh f control the function of a television at a far off distance at remote distance . <EOS>
k no <EOS> the kinetic ones come come with um a sort of w watch a battery that goes in a watch . <EOS> right , okay , got you . <EOS> so it's a lot smaller , <EOS> so it would <EOS> got you on that okay , <EOS> didn't realise . <EOS>
yeah , <EOS> i if you're in the dark , you can't see the remote . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> it's only few leds . only four or something . four led . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> no , <EOS> i dunno . <EOS> but if we use a battery station , <EOS> which i think we will use <EOS>
market range internationally sold . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> production cost , <EOS> ah right <EOS> it's gotta be can't cost any more than twelve fifty to make . <EOS> ah right okay . <EOS> experience with with remote control , <EOS> so talk about who who's used what . any ideas ? <EOS> stuff like that . <EOS> next meeting starts in thirty minutes . <EOS> at quarter to twelve . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah , and there's other features for example on other systems where you can pause live t_v_ and things like that . <EOS> they're just features from the internet uh from computers are are coming into the t_v_ sort of under the covers , <EOS> but you still use it through a teletext . <EOS> so now the things to think here are that that there's gonna be more functionality , potentially that we can handle . <EOS>
the speech interface <EOS> and uh less uh reasonable uh cost . <EOS> expensive . <EOS> price . <EOS> mm . <EOS> and the lighting adaptation <EOS> and the teletext . <EOS> and regarding the teletext uh these are the subtitl these are the text information which you got on the televisions . <EOS> if you are watching an foreign movie , you get subtitles sometimes . <EOS> and uh if you are a french guy watching an english movie you would like to have it in french . <EOS> and if i am a german then i would like to have the my options in german . <EOS> so , the remote it should have some it should give me some flexibility of choosing the ch languages . <EOS> that should be a good uh point . <EOS>
um . <EOS> so let's not use the whiteboard any more . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> um . <EOS> upsidaisy . <EOS> oops , sorry . <EOS> okay . <EOS> and uh so what else was there ? <EOS> um the <EOS> what about the glow-in-the-dark thing , the strip around it ? <EOS> are we just gonna leave that ? <EOS>
mm . <EOS> that's right . <EOS> okay , now . <EOS> so we i guess we use one . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yes . <EOS> what ? <EOS> t cell or chart you are trying to change is protected . <EOS> well , that's nice . <EOS> she told me i could just ch change it here and then it would <EOS> it doesn't work . <EOS> hmm . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> okay . <EOS> it's not a button <EOS> it's a led , <EOS> it's a <EOS> it's a led actually <EOS> which which 'll be covering in a curve <EOS> ac actually yeah it should be embedded . <EOS> mm , yes i see , mm okay . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> no , not mine yet . <EOS> oh . <EOS> um maybe we should bring so that the camera can see . yeah . <EOS> okay . sure . <EOS> okay . <EOS> we made three for you . <EOS> three ? oh . <EOS> um one's based on the banana , one's based on the tomato <EOS> and the other one is st <EOS>
. oh . <EOS> and uh <EOS> i dunno <EOS> that's a question to you <EOS> and to mm to <EOS> well so <EOS> i heard that uh it seems that speech recognition is something that can be done <EOS> uh so that's the smartness of the thing . <EOS> currently we don't have guns with speech recognition or uh beer cans with speech recognition <EOS> but we may have remote controls with speech recognition . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> we talked about before . <EOS> so <EOS> we we want to have a product fancy look and feel , technologically innovative , easy to use , fashion , easy to find in a room , and robust , <EOS> uh and uh uh <EOS> i have a scale of uh seven points . <EOS> okay . so <EOS> i go through all the uh all the points here , <EOS> and uh according to what you think about the this project you can uh mm make a one point , two point or seven point . <EOS> okay ? <EOS> and after we ha we have an an average , and uh we see . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> maybe you can presen <EOS> okay . <EOS> maybe hold it . <EOS> so i think it's uh very uh very nice . <EOS> what do you think ? <EOS> i give it a i give it a five . <EOS> yeah . so <EOS> it's between one and seven ? <EOS> seven is the highest uh ? <EOS> i will give a six . <EOS>
o or we could like take off this . <EOS> they could buy cases , maybe , <EOS> they could come back . and buy the extra case . <EOS> so we could do like a b a hard base plastic , and then we could give two latex covers to start . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> okay . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> okay . right . <EOS> so <EOS> alright ? <EOS> any um comments on all of that ? <EOS> well , um one of the things that we have to decide on by the end of the meeting is who we're gonna be um who's our our target audience , our target market . <EOS> um , so if we want something that that looks good and is easy to use , but has y is fairly powerful product , whatever , who do we really want to aim that at ? <EOS> i mean <EOS>
mm . <EOS> cool . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> it is . <EOS> you know , s some sort of physical something or other . <EOS> that sounds good . <EOS> um and you're gonna be working on the product evaluation . <EOS> evaluation . <EOS> um . <EOS> and i will be uh <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> sorry what does that stand for ? <EOS> which means <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> if you if <EOS> yeah if you have like buttons that appear on the screen in this l_c_d_ screen . <EOS> like you have on a l uh <EOS> icons or something y you have is a good example of g_u_i_ graphic user interface . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> at the beginning it started out <EOS> and i felt actually like under pressure <EOS> like the first couple were taking a lot of work <EOS> and i was like had like all this brainstorming i was doing <EOS> and then suddenly i was like well it's just another two minute presentation <EOS> that you guys don't really care about anyway <EOS> so type away . <EOS> you know , you know what i mean <EOS> like we all sort of knew where we were headed with it <EOS> so it didn't feel like it mattered anymore . <EOS>
yeah . we are doing just the television . <EOS> no . <EOS> i think that's quite clear from the the information that we've been given , <EOS> no ? <EOS> mm . <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> like in the email of television only . in fact they're in the constraints email that i got . <EOS>
okay , well <EOS> we have some expertise from uh different pieces of the of the company . <EOS> that's good . <EOS> um well <EOS> i said uh we're working on a project <EOS> and the aim for the project is to to create a to design a new remote control <EOS> which uh has to be original , trendy and of course , user friendly . <EOS> and uh i hope we have the expertise to create such a project such a product . <EOS>
like a banana . <EOS> and uh also at the different aspect like having a wheel etcetera . <EOS> and the cost ended to be ten point seven euros . <EOS> so <EOS> which is uh good , <EOS> because we had a price gap of twelve point five euros . <EOS>
five ? <EOS> four . <EOS> four . <EOS> four . <EOS> four . <EOS> so four point two ? <EOS> four . <EOS> just four . <EOS> obviously there are some outliers so <EOS> four . <EOS> so four ? <EOS> okay cool ? cool device . <EOS> there i'll give it seven . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> i would give it a seven . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> as in it's not . <EOS> oh , sorry , one . <EOS> oh sorry , one , d yeah . <EOS> a one . <EOS> a one a one . <EOS> so i'll just write criteria criteria one we get one . <EOS> second criteria , new technology . <EOS> have we implemented new technology ? <EOS> as in the new high-tech <EOS>
no , <EOS> tha that will be <EOS> that's your choice , i think huh . <EOS> so <EOS> y you can put the bottom of the remote control in recharger ? <EOS> is that is that a good good opportunity ? <EOS> so <EOS> you could put it like that , <EOS> okay . <EOS>
um just a a lot of the um <EOS> i mean one of the things running through my mind right now , <EOS> i realise we're being efficient to wrap up the meeting and have lots of decisions made , <EOS> um but we are leaning quite a bit to the side of being low-tech , rubber buttons plastic frame , <EOS> it's almost like we're reproducing the same old remote control that's out there . <EOS> should we think about how we are actually getting this high-tech user friendly uh um theme <EOS> like what is it that we're u we're using to to achieve those goals ? <EOS> like <EOS>
okay . <EOS> so these percentages are are what ? <EOS> okay . speech recognition . <EOS> uh , yes . <EOS> if we look at the costs whether the consumers they are willing to uh pay more for speech recognition in a remote control or not , we can find that they up to a thirty five years age group we have a very good disliking for this uh this uh point , like for speech recognition in a remote control . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> um i want to know why it b uh just uh sorry but for the point before uh why not the rubber , if it is something that it seems to be light . <EOS> the cost . <EOS> uh uh and also like in if you put a it's be difficult to do all the moulding of buttons and these things <EOS> and <EOS>
right , okay , yeah . <EOS> yeah , it does seem like our our responsibilities have some overlap . <EOS> i guess that's what it says . <EOS> you two you two are gonna be just , i think , you just double up , you know , you working together . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah i was thinking , if if you have your hand , <EOS> it this is your th <EOS> yeah . <EOS> what kind of <EOS> harder . <EOS> yeah the lower part doesn't work i guess , <EOS> so maybe you should try it over there . <EOS>
yeah <EOS> maybe a maybe a white a white backlight ? <EOS> like this . <EOS> white backlight , and dark . <EOS> dark uh letters , yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> whatever which is visible . <EOS> i know you sh you should test it under uh under a light conditions . <EOS> i mean it's hard to tell uh i dunno . <EOS>
i think another thing that would help is um if it beeps when you clap , <EOS> because i think one of the big things that happens is people lose them . they can't find it . <EOS> yes . <EOS> that is true , <EOS> because they put a newspaper or they put it behind a plant or , we you know , whatever . <EOS> and and they suddenly the phone rings and they want to turn the t_v_ off and they say , where the hell is my my remote control yeah ? <EOS>
yeah , <EOS> th that's the only problem . <EOS> i d <EOS> they don't say how much it will cost , <EOS> so um but uh <EOS> if we implement uh speech recognition , i think it would be better to implement l_c_d_ as well . <EOS> oh . <EOS> it's mass production . <EOS> so you can say , you can <EOS>
yeah , yeah . <EOS> mm 'kay . hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> well uh <EOS> if you we can have <EOS> if you have new more ideas we can add new more uh some more keys <EOS> if you want to <EOS> you know <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS>
that doesn't look like a cow , does it ? <EOS> it looks very very cute . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> i like the cow . <EOS> i'm jen . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> um i like dogs too , <EOS> but i can't do that already <EOS> because i can't draw a dog as well as you can . <EOS> i like <EOS>
it's gonna roll away . um so i guess after the meeting we'll have some questionnaires . <EOS> and uh and some summaries for for what's going on . <EOS> um then we'll take lunch . <EOS> then we can come back and uh work on our individual work . <EOS> um i'll do the minutes . <EOS> uh let's see . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> one , okay . <EOS> um electronics . <EOS> single . <EOS> simple , simple rather . <EOS> simple . <EOS> simple . <EOS> mm 'kay . <EOS> um the case . <EOS> uh uh uh double-curved . <EOS> guess it's double-curved . <EOS> it is pretty curvy . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> well <EOS> then then it's be uh back to the building a receiving uh well uh if it's actually worth it to build it in , <EOS> we could actually look at into it , <EOS> but i dunno , <EOS> it it would be uh bringing more costs uh with with it <EOS> and <EOS>
is easy to use and see . <EOS> and see . <EOS> okay . <EOS> uh . <EOS> yes . <EOS> can i just check ? <EOS> is this just a television remote ? <EOS> because a lot of um systems are kind of t_v_ video combined now , <EOS> or t_v_ d_v_d_ combined . <EOS> and one of the most annoying things is having like five remotes in the house . <EOS> so if you've got a combined system , it could be a combined remote . <EOS>
well <EOS> it d <EOS> that's that's the most expensive chip , we need . if we're doing uh if we're doing a display . <EOS> yeah okay . <EOS> so <EOS> we <EOS> well <EOS> we can <EOS> i had uh to make a sort of a design . <EOS> so i did some searching on the internet . <EOS> i watched the old remote controls and news com remote como uh remote controls . <EOS>
yeah , yeah . <EOS> this is good idea . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> ah , yes . <EOS> so . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , so you don't have to display here , <EOS> just display on the t_v_ screen , right ? <EOS> good idea . <EOS> yeah in the dis display on the t_v_ screen <EOS> and just uh with the with your remote control would just navigate through the f <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> uh , should've added five . <EOS> do we have an online calculator ? <EOS> i'm attempting to do that right now . <EOS> this is . <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah it is one point nine . <EOS> ooh . <EOS> yay . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> and that means tha that means you get to bump that bit to the t_v_ maker , so <EOS> yeah . <EOS> oh . <EOS> so that's um the user interface <EOS> um so <EOS> there you go . <EOS> i guess there are a lot of options that we're gonna have to choose from among , <EOS>
mm . <EOS> mm . i think then we we're really losing ease of use . <EOS> bottom . okay , . <EOS> that will create another problem . for the people to use it . <EOS> it's not going to be easy . okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> mm . so um <EOS> i i think we should we should cut the l_c_d_ screen . that that's that's my opinion . <EOS>
oh right . <EOS> okay so out of um different uh figures and ratings ob uh of people in general , um consumers in general , the number one thing that was found was that uh the br t television remote control , a fancy look and feel , okay , <EOS> and not , it specified , not a functional look or or feel , uh b f f fancy . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> for for for my sur um <EOS> jens . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> no , <EOS> but your b your surname . <EOS> uh damman . d_ a_ w_ . <EOS> w_o_ da . okay . <EOS> uh uh m_ m_ . i mean m_ . double m_ . <EOS>
can we justify it ? <EOS> right . <EOS> so <EOS> where do you guys come up with these numbers ? <EOS> that's just off the top of my head , <EOS> it is pending further emails . <EOS> from the board , <EOS> um , well <EOS> right . <EOS>
it it's more like integrated scor . <EOS> i think that this will be like a scroll wheel , actually . <EOS> y you tu you turn you turn it , so <EOS> no no . <EOS> yeah tha that's wheel . <EOS> no no no , it <EOS> okay . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> well <EOS> it would be f <EOS> we will we can make this for for twelve euro fi and fifty cents . yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> no you can't . <EOS> and we don't know where the state of the art of speech recognition is , <EOS> maybe you know ? <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> okay gentlemens , we have to take some deci decisions right now . <EOS> um so if i if i kind of summarise everything we've de we we said . <EOS> we are targeting t_v_ . <EOS>
this is a team-building time <EOS> where , um , , <EOS> okay cool , um <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay , <EOS> let's stand up and support you <EOS> my favourite animal , which changes all the time , okay , <EOS> right now it is an elk . <EOS> alright , so <EOS>
mm-hmm . good point . <EOS> and uh the second important thing is uh uh uh integrated circuit . <EOS> uh which uh we can use a highly sophisticated one because it's like the it's like the heart of the remote controller . <EOS> if it is not efficient then everything wi is going to be uh like um the lef ess less efficient so it you should we should have a highly sophisticated one . <EOS> and it should be resistant to high as well as uh low temperatures . <EOS> suppose if it is thirty-eight degrees outside forty degrees outside , it should it should uh be able to re uh resist the uh temperature uh uh highs and uh high temperatures and low temperatures . <EOS> and uh it should be with uh um equipped with timer and alarm facility . <EOS> and the uh other component we should uh we have in the remote controller is a resistor <EOS> uh which is like uh uh i it is very very much important for the electricity uh flow through through through the uh remote controller <EOS> and uh also a capacitor <EOS> which is a b which is a m i think it's it's like a battery , capacitor . <EOS> can you go on to the next slide , please ? <EOS>
no . <EOS> so <EOS> the battery , <EOS> we have um advanced chip on print . <EOS> one . <EOS> so it would be curved , single curve . <EOS> because of thing <EOS> yeah , well you can at least make it curved again . <EOS> or not ? <EOS>
no . <EOS> b you think uh <EOS> i i'm user interface manager . <EOS> okay . okay . <EOS> if i could go there with this cable . <EOS> ah . <EOS> sorry , i'm sorry . sorry . <EOS> okay , so . <EOS> you're scaring me with l_c_d_ man . <EOS> and speech recognition in remote unit , it will be very e expensive . <EOS>
okay , <EOS> so my name is petre . <EOS> you can call me petre , or peter if you like . <EOS> i don't care . <EOS> okay . <EOS> uh my name's bob mor . <EOS> oh , sorry . <EOS> and you are ? in the project ? <EOS>
yeah , yeah . <EOS> oh . <EOS> five minutes to end of meeting . <EOS> oh , okay . <EOS> we're a bit behind . <EOS> do you know what i mean ? <EOS> like so sort of like how do you <EOS> i i mean one one way of looking at it would be , well the people producing television sets , maybe they have to buy remote controls . <EOS> or another way is maybe people who have t_v_ sets are really fed up with their remote control and they really want a better one or something . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> um hmm <EOS> tha that would be a consideration to take into account yes . <EOS> um . <EOS> sorry i didn't mean to derail you there . <EOS> yeah well tha that's uh for later down the road um , <EOS> and then as for the user interface it should be trendy , <EOS> um and not computery , <EOS> right , so more low tech and not too many buttons . <EOS> so i took these all into consideration <EOS> and also i have some limitations from the boss . <EOS>
what is r_s_i_ ? <EOS> r_s_i_ is like , when you're using the same um doing the same movement several times , then you get injured . <EOS> okay ? <EOS> so , <EOS> those numbers are less important then the previous one , <EOS> but still it has to be taken to count . <EOS> so <EOS> last slide . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> looking , i think . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> we have to put our real reaction logo as well on the on the remote control . <EOS> so <EOS> the colours also . <EOS> so we have ha to ma make it in black , black , yellow . <EOS>
we could <EOS> yeah , we could on here . <EOS> alright , let's go forward then . <EOS> um right now so we're all gonna draw our favourite animal and then sum up our favourite characteristics of that animal . <EOS> even if you are not a good drawer like me . <EOS> alright . <EOS>
and we just stick with two batteries <EOS> so it's not any solar or <EOS> yeah yeah j yeah , <EOS> because <EOS> yeah . <EOS> classical , we stay classical in that we don't reinvent uh the wheel . <EOS> anyway it's very <EOS> in general i think people uh change t_v_ more often than batteries of their remote control . <EOS> so . <EOS> because the trend goes faster than the life of the <EOS>
mm . <EOS> so basically um <EOS> the basic function of a remote control is to send uh messages to another system that is fixed . <EOS> and so <EOS> an energy source feeds an integrated circuit , the chip , <EOS> that can compose messages , usually uh through a um infrared bit <EOS> and uh the user interface controls the chip and accordingly the the messages , <EOS> alright . <EOS>
and the l_c_d_ makes it better . yeah . <EOS> yeah <EOS> . and you might have a slight thing for to forward and <EOS> yeah . yeah . yeah . <EOS> mm , okay . <EOS> so i will say two . <EOS> yeah <EOS> it's d it's definitely more fancier than that one . <EOS>
if we're k trying to keep it colourful and slightly organic , then i think titanium's too futuristic . <EOS> it's difficult to make fancy shapes in it as well , <EOS> we can't for example have a double curved case in titanium unfortunately . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> whereas a plastic's so cheap and easy and mouldable and everything else . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> uh i thought mo maybe we could make a clap system , <EOS> so when you clap your hands it will beep or something . <EOS> uh you must find it uh quickly . <EOS> uh . maybe just a button on the home station . <EOS> so remote control beeps when you click that button on the home station . <EOS>
just <EOS> uh yeah i think <EOS> did we decide it didn't affect the circuit board , it just affected <EOS> yeah , i think so . <EOS> just just for the call and find thing . <EOS> it was just <EOS> i had speech recognition requires advanced <EOS> req require <EOS>
are we um are we planning to take an off the shelf an o_e_m_ component for the radio wave circuit , or are we planning to construct our own circuit board ? <EOS> no no no no no . <EOS> this we this we buy i think , because it's rather cheap nowadays <EOS> and it's not worth to construct ourselves . <EOS>
yep . <EOS> mm 'kay . <EOS> just remember when i made up this report i didn't have the information that we're discussing here . <EOS> and and so so uh yeah when we have a cradle , when we have some kind of design , <EOS> so what i'm saying is , from my perspective , i don't have a product to market right now . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm <EOS> mm-hmm <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> the user interface restrictions basically means that if you use more complicated features , like the buttons are standard okay , the l_c_d_ panel and the scroll wheel you need more complicated logic . <EOS> um the case okay with a rubber case you can't have the solar panels . <EOS> okay with the titanium case , <EOS> let me just check that um , <EOS> titanium case can't be curved , it has to be square . <EOS>
okay , <EOS> and we only need one of those . <EOS> okay , <EOS> the case will be uncurved and flat or a single curve or a double curve . <EOS> it looks like it single curve , <EOS> 'cause of th the chunkiness . <EOS> it's <EOS> that's uh uh one . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> if they wanted . <EOS> i think it's good to sell a basic thing and then sell options . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> the <EOS> what the top face , right ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> because the soft latex definitely is squishy . <EOS> that's in . <EOS> well i mean squishier than like , yeah , just a hard plastic . <EOS>
dark grey , something like this this colour or something . <EOS> just a regular uh remote colour . <EOS> and then have uh different covers uh to use . <EOS> yeah like like yeah . <EOS> or or silver . <EOS> i think it's better to have silver nowadays . <EOS>
yeah , <EOS> i dunno . <EOS> so , <EOS> is it very usable ? <EOS> that's what i'm looking at . <EOS> and and do you have to speak in in like in a thing <EOS> or <EOS> yeah . <EOS> is <EOS> maybe maybe it's too hard to uh to realise that . <EOS> it <EOS> we have short time to to put it on the market , <EOS> so that <EOS>
it's kinda like what the remote phone used to do . <EOS> mm . oh , yeah , that's true . <EOS> we could definitely include that if we wanted to . <EOS> you know like go to the base . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> if it's within our price . <EOS>
six . <EOS> mm , six for me also . <EOS> six . <EOS> so <EOS> six point five . <EOS> six point five . <EOS> okay . <EOS> 'kay . <EOS> six six six point five . <EOS> okay . <EOS> is it fashion ? <EOS> seven ? <EOS> oh yeah , <EOS> its its f its fruit fruit shape . <EOS> i would say seven . <EOS> and is very very nice design . <EOS>
it looks better . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> be worth exploring anyway . <EOS> uh . <EOS> right , well um <EOS> so just to wrap up , <EOS> the next meeting's gonna be in thirty minutes . <EOS> so that's about um about ten to twelve by my watch . <EOS> um so inbetween now and then , um as the industrial designer , you're gonna be working on you know the actual working design of it <EOS> so y you know what you're doing there . <EOS> um for user interface , technical functions , <EOS> i guess that's you know like what we've been talking about , <EOS> what it'll actually do . <EOS> um and uh marketing executive , <EOS>
well <EOS> what of people with like the t_v_ in their basement , <EOS> like what if wha <EOS> we can't guarantee sunlight everywhere <EOS> so having a secondary source is probably <EOS> mm . yep . <EOS> it's true . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> it works about the same as a solar powered calculator , <EOS> and you know how those those don't really require that much light , <EOS> um , but obviously a little more light than a calculator , but we're not talking about a lot of light . <EOS> doesn't have to be out taking a sunbath for a few hours a day or anything . <EOS>
sorry ? <EOS> yeah yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> the variance is mi it's is minimal . <EOS> i'm um answering your question . <EOS> okay . <EOS> and that's the criteria i i found more useful . <EOS> i think i sh i i could write the criteria in the on the whiteboard ? <EOS> and we all four could range <EOS>
mm 'kay . <EOS> um i have nothing on my screen . <EOS> just a sec . <EOS> mm . <EOS> here we are . <EOS> ooh , <EOS> no signal . <EOS> okay , yeah , it's fine . <EOS> okay , <EOS> requirements . we have a couple new requirements <EOS> that i was just e-mailed right before the meeting <EOS> and that we have to keep in in um in mind as we're creating this . <EOS> we didn't bring it up yet , or at all in the meetings so far , <EOS> but we're not gonna work with teletext <EOS> because um well it that's been taken over by the internet , <EOS> so we're not gonna worry about um we're not gonna worry about that . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> but would it be useful to imple implement both ? <EOS> yeah , if the costs al allow it . <EOS> on one remote ? <EOS> or <EOS> well <EOS> yeah , i dunno . <EOS> i don't know if that can be done with the cost of twelve fifty . <EOS> with that uh <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> . <EOS> right . <EOS> man . <EOS> yeah okay . <EOS> okay you get it . <EOS> uh for example if y if you put all the <EOS> right . <EOS> you want the normal piece of paper ? and you have a pen ? <EOS>
true . <EOS> yeah , yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so we should take that in consideration . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> let's see what more i have to tell you . <EOS> i don't think there is much left . nope . <EOS> we're starting to close . <EOS> um our next meeting uh will start well we're a little bit early , but our next meeting will start in in thirty minutes . <EOS> in the meantime uh there's time for some uh individual actions . <EOS>
yeah you could , you could have some sort of stylus that you could pull out <EOS> but i i think they could get a bit easily lost , <EOS> 'cause i had <EOS> like one of the palm pop thing . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> they're easy to replace as well , cheap . <EOS>
i don't know if we have to do it now , <EOS> maybe later later . <EOS> so <EOS> yeah i think you can do it . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> i don't know . <EOS> so <EOS> the selling price of the product will be twenty five euros . <EOS> yeah . yeah . <EOS> i think it's quite good price , yeah . <EOS> and uh <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> good . <EOS> and by the way , mister david jordan , please record your presentations in your own folder . not in mine . <EOS> should be better . <EOS> okay okay , that's clear . <EOS> okay . okay . <EOS>
. <EOS> so it doesn't draw the attention away . <EOS> this is dreadful . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i made uh uh my own map . <EOS> no not this , but the task . <EOS> yeah . no that's okay . <EOS> no i just flapped it , closed it , took it here and then this happened . <EOS>
yeah thank you , thank you very much . <EOS> thank you very much . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> how can you change from v_c_r_ to uh t_v_ , by the way ? <EOS> oh <EOS> no no no , <EOS> this is a single this <EOS> this is a model with just the t_v_ one . <EOS> no no <EOS> just <EOS> sorry , <EOS> this is a standard t_v_ one , <EOS> we are not talking about that . <EOS> so <EOS> and then we have usually there twelve keys <EOS> but we know that we rel that we have only ten digits . <EOS> the extra two are for uh having or giving an option for uh having more than one channel . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah whistle . <EOS> i don't know , whistle-able ? <EOS> whistle tracking . <EOS> th <EOS> whistle tracking yeah . <EOS> whistle tracking remote control . <EOS> that's a good idea , that's very original and that's can uh improve . <EOS> that's that's quite cool , <EOS> but uh of course we you don't normally need uh any audio uh recording stuff on your remote control right ? <EOS>
and the l_c_d_ is this one , on the remote ? <EOS> yep . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i think it's not a good idea <EOS> because after maybe one or two months of function is getting destroyed . <EOS> mm . <EOS> if you <EOS> uh okay this is new prototype uh . <EOS>
oh yeah , <EOS> i forgot to mention that . <EOS> the uh rubber material is the type of stress ball material , not just normal rubber . <EOS> forgot to say that . <EOS> okay . okay , <EOS> so <EOS> kinda spongy material . <EOS> um we want something fancy and techni technologically innovative , obviously . <EOS> but what we what we need is something that looks like it's from the future <EOS> that looks cool , <EOS> that's that's different , <EOS> you know , <EOS> that's <EOS> everyone has a white remote control , black remote control , <EOS> you need something cool . <EOS> like , titanium is cool <EOS> but it's expensive . <EOS> and maybe it's a bit of overkill for a remote control . <EOS> um now the fruit and veg options , either we we go in that direction <EOS> or we stay totally away from it . <EOS> um i mean the research did come up with fruit and veg , <EOS> so maybe it is important <EOS> for <EOS> it's the up to the interface guy . <EOS> so <EOS> if we stay away from it , s you know stay away from it , <EOS> but if we're gonna go along with it then it doesn't necessarily have to be like an apple or something like that , or a kiwi fruit . <EOS> it could be something like , i say potato peeler <EOS> but i'm sure you guys have a have a much cooler idea than i do . <EOS> so <EOS> i think cool is the key . <EOS>
yeah , <EOS> but i have a mouse that's uh uh also uh <EOS> rechargeable . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> and and you just have normal batteries that you can recharge and just put it in the station , <EOS> or you can change your batteries , <EOS> so . <EOS>
so <EOS> i in fact the the f <EOS> something i want to discuss is which kind of material are we going to use , <EOS> so <EOS> will it will be wooden wooden di wooden remote control <EOS> or a a plastic remote control like this one . <EOS> so and <EOS> in which which which kind will be the the different bu button , <EOS> so <EOS> it can be some , you know , classic pushbutton like this one , <EOS> or you have also some button like l_c_d_ <EOS> where you know , the button the buttons are unlighted during the night , <EOS> or , you know , you can see them in the darkness . <EOS> and <EOS>
yeah , simplification . <EOS> they could have a crap remote <EOS> that came with their t_v_ <EOS> that's just impossible to use , <EOS> or maybe it broke , <EOS> or maybe they're just missing it . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> simplification , <EOS> so <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS>
mm . kinda . <EOS> yes for the remote . <EOS> maybe no not f for <EOS> technology used . <EOS> technology . <EOS> alright . <EOS> closing . <EOS> costs are within the budget . <EOS> project is evaluated . <EOS> um complete the final questionnaire and meeting summary . <EOS> that's it . <EOS>
you can put the r_ and r_ . <EOS> in <EOS> which people will find they're uh interesting . <EOS> and uh will buy uh them faster when they look at the same old grey or black uh colours . <EOS> uh s as i said uh before rubber is uh is impossible to damage severely <EOS> imp instead of uh <EOS> of course you can break it when you you when you break it in s for example with a pair of scissors or something like that , <EOS> but i if you drop it it's not uh broken uh right away s instead of using uh plastic , hard plastic or uh titanium . <EOS> and i personally liked uh the single curved uh remote control , <EOS> because it yeah it makes sense . <EOS> okay .
yeah . <EOS> true . <EOS> fair enough . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah <EOS> it's just a scroll . <EOS> right . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so <EOS> are we gonna are we talking <EOS> we need to figure out what kind of buttons we're going to use , <EOS> are we going to use scroll buttons ? rubber buttons ? um <EOS>
can turn it maybe . <EOS> to switch from buttons to interface hmm . if you turn it a little . <EOS> . <EOS> maybe you can c have this kind of shape . <EOS> a little upwards . so that the screen is more <EOS> . <EOS> oh yeah . least you can easily see it . <EOS>
yes . <EOS> okay , so <EOS> look and feel ? <EOS> where um one is <EOS> i've broken the pen again . <EOS> uh there is another pen . <EOS> s <EOS> yeah . <EOS> get that one . <EOS> um w one's bad <EOS> and seven's the best . <EOS> sorry , <EOS> one's true <EOS> and seven's false . <EOS> one's the best . <EOS>
of <EOS> no problem , no problem . <EOS> oh . ? <EOS> ? <EOS> no . <EOS> mm <EOS> . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> it's it's a se it's my priority this one . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm . <EOS> a person ? <EOS> no . <EOS> it's a really crazy dog <EOS>
n <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i even got spam . or something like that . <EOS> that's what we said . <EOS> so does this <EOS> i think lik oh and information was a bit low i think , sometimes , <EOS> in in in in the beginning i didn't understand what what to do . <EOS>
yeah , <EOS> that's gonna be up to these guys . <EOS> i my reaction is no , but <EOS> well <EOS> what i can do is i can d look into ho well pedro and i can look into how much this might increase our our costs <EOS> and you can look into what kind of effect an increased cost is gonna have on our on our final numbers . <EOS>
okay , <EOS> for this budget like twelve euros . <EOS> i it's an option . <EOS> well , <EOS> i dunno . <EOS> yeah <EOS> actually we we can have one switch to like uh switch on , on and off , this processor <EOS> and this really , <EOS> suppose like here we have our main chip <EOS> which controls power , volume and this part and this d_s_p_s . <EOS>
so <EOS> we're still in meeting , <EOS> aren't we ? <EOS> yeah , <EOS> i think i've <EOS> okay . <EOS> mm . <EOS> sorry , <EOS> what what actually are these <EOS> is that the yellow and black ? <EOS> it doesn't tell me . <EOS> mm . <EOS>
well , if you're looking at if you looking at something that's going to be bought by people , you have to make it new , you have to make it state of the art . <EOS> well <EOS> that would mean we'd have to make a television as well . <EOS>
well of the designers what are they ? <EOS> uh what can a t_v_ do ? <EOS> okay things like um brightness , contrast , <EOS> um maybe tuning the channels . <EOS> uh-huh . <EOS> okay channel tuning . <EOS> that's a good one . <EOS> um . <EOS> what else ? <EOS> um the various inputs . <EOS> are you having a v_c_r_ , are you having you know which input do you have ? <EOS>
um i h i had an idea single covered uh curved , sorry , single curved . <EOS> uh so <EOS> it's t two dimensional . <EOS> i think it's uh it's best to draw <EOS> oh <EOS> green . <EOS> it's a colour . <EOS> bright colour . fancy colour . forward . <EOS>
i think the base would definitely be larger , <EOS> 'cause some of these are not as easy to hold . <EOS> they're kinda smallish . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> no but i imagine even if it was bigger , like if it's round and it's big then you you can't get <EOS> that's why remote controls are long because you have that thumb kind of <EOS> so c they could all be bananas and cucumbers . <EOS> um but i don't s <EOS> i i personally don't think this is comfortable to to sit there , like it's an awkward position . <EOS>
wow . <EOS> okay , <EOS> cool . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> so . um <EOS> this is a worm . <EOS> hmm yeah , that's nice . <EOS> wow . <EOS> okay , <EOS> who next ? uh <EOS> uh do you have to write down why <EOS> uh that doesn't matter , <EOS> just it's to get used to the whiteboard , <EOS> but it's okay . <EOS> just make a new blank new blank page . <EOS>
alright . <EOS> alright , okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> thank you , <EOS> mis <EOS> okay . well thank you all . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> and then i guess we'll start in thirty minutes again . <EOS> thank you . <EOS> very good . <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS>
okay , well <EOS> yep . <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay we all ready to go ? <EOS> well how um on the in this meeting then if we um <EOS> yep . <EOS> i'll just just recap on the minutes from the last meeting . <EOS> and we uh decided on <EOS>
and l_c_d_ buttons . <EOS> yeah , l_c_d_ . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> i think for these supplements the solar energy would be something quite interesting and not maybe too difficult to add . <EOS> yeah , yeah , yeah . <EOS> and pf what can we think a supplement to <EOS>
yes . <EOS> um i with some remote controls the buttons were a little small <EOS> so they're quite hard to press <EOS> so maybe we make something with uh easy to press buttons . <EOS> as that is the main function . <EOS> okay , so so basically we're looking for some um we're looking for a device that is um robust <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah <EOS> you can you can embed it uh microphone here . <EOS> a microphone maybe . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> but wha what is the use of voice or gesture recognition if you have a remote control li like this , if you have an object . <EOS> if you want to use voice or gesture you need to be free , without any object . <EOS> you just want to interact with television . <EOS>
okay , is everybody ready ? <EOS> yeah ? <EOS> yeah i'd to just put on my microphone here and i'll be right with you . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> okay ? <EOS> um <EOS> i take it you all have received instructions as to what you were supposed to do <EOS> and um <EOS>
right . <EOS> yep , <EOS> i'm just open to being creative . <EOS> uh i'm katie , <EOS> i'm the industrial designer <EOS> and i'll just be i guess presenting about the the inter workings of our little remote control <EOS> and uh <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yep , <EOS> good . <EOS> okay , <EOS> very very quickly , um this <EOS> i don't want to make this meeting too structured <EOS> because the the whole idea is that it's a um you know a think tank . <EOS> everybody says what they what they want to say , <EOS> uh and we don't want to be constrained by uh kind of convention or uh uh slides on screens or or anything else <EOS> um but um briefly um th th this is what we want to do . <EOS> the the remote control needs to be original , <EOS> there has to be something about it that uh other remote controls don't have <EOS> so that as soon as people see it they think um yes that's different , <EOS> uh i want one , <EOS> um and that goes along with being trendy , uh uh you know the i want it uh scenario . <EOS> user-friendly <EOS> as as we all know , remote controls can be uh uh very user-unfriendly <EOS> so we want to make ours one that people can pick up <EOS> and think oh yes that's it's obvious how that works , <EOS> uh and they also want to look at the price and think oh yeah that's something that <EOS> i may not need another remote control <EOS> but uh it's such a nice one <EOS> i'm gonna have one . <EOS> and last but not least , or indeed first of all , it it must make the company money , <EOS> and we make the company money by producing what the consumer wants . <EOS>
on the <EOS> you can just take theirs and just <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so <EOS> um , right . <EOS> what if <EOS> i mean , if you're thinking of the design of it now , like the a you know , physical attributes , <EOS> um , and you just have this , it's like just a long silver thing , <EOS> or whatever we're thinking . <EOS> i mean are you you gonna have any buttons on that besides power and this thing ? <EOS> or <EOS>
uh-huh . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> are you thinking are you thinking of of a light in the sense of um a light light , <EOS> or a light in the sense of it glows kind of you know frankenstein , it's alive . <EOS> illuminate the buttons . <EOS> yeah it glows . <EOS> well m i'm thinking along the lines of you're you're in the dark watching a d_v_d_ and you um you find the thing in the dark and you go like this , <EOS> and that's what everybody does . oh where's the volume button in the dark , <EOS> and uh y you just touch it , or you just pick it up , and it lights up or something . <EOS>
project evaluation . <EOS> room for creativity . <EOS> this room is a bit small , but <EOS> but i think it's okay for us to work with . <EOS> i feel it's fine , <EOS> we know we don't need uh i think it's okay . <EOS> yeah mm . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> so not <EOS> yeah okay . <EOS> not uh the old uh box look . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> and um sports and gaming device style characteristics . <EOS> i don't know exactly what that means , <EOS> but it should be , well yeah , popular kind of <EOS>
so there are some of the findings . <EOS> so we need to combine those ones um <EOS> and i've just got an e-mail from our technical department saying that they have broken through with some new speech recognition software that you can program in . <EOS> um yeah it is , just in time , very handy . <EOS> um so <EOS> i think maybe incorporating that in our design would be good . <EOS> it's <EOS> you program it like you say , record , um and then , play , and then , record , play machine , and stuff like that , <EOS> so that's <EOS> and it's much <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
yeah , <EOS> but you have the remote control , <EOS> so maybe you can keep it f with you . <EOS> you're not you're not obliged to share it . <EOS> that's right . <EOS> oh , okay , okay , <EOS> you mean it could be a problem for this kind of stuff . <EOS>
he also . <EOS> i i think we will be finished this uh <EOS> mm . <EOS> is it for uh for putting a for logos , no . <EOS> okay . <EOS> that's <EOS> let's move on . <EOS> so here the uh financial objective of our project . <EOS> that is to say to to have a production cost lower than twelve point five euros <EOS> and have a selling price of twice that price t in order to target a profe profit of uh fifty uh million euros . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> for some reason they they they click the off button when they want to use the <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so there's a problem in the design of that kind of remote control somehow , <EOS> i dunno . <EOS> mm . so , some kind of idea uh with um um cellular phone with a a screen that will tell you what <EOS> no . <EOS>
it's a bit uh large . <EOS> oh that's a bit big . yeah . <EOS> you also do the other sides . <EOS> not only on the front si uh the top side but also the the side view . <EOS> yeah . ex exactly . <EOS> . <EOS> l let's make first the the the all the views . the the front view , side view and the back view . <EOS>
no . <EOS> here is what this thing should be . <EOS> this thing we are gonna um uh design is a new remote control . <EOS> uh should be original , trendy , and , of course , user friendly . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> so maybe you wanna make some notes of that . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> alright . <EOS> let's hear what kate has to say . okay then . <EOS> maybe afterwards we could do a uh whiteboard with that your the one on the right as a as a basis . <EOS> hmm . whiteboard session . <EOS> i think the white that one on the right is , as well as less cluttered ,
mm-hmm . <EOS> 's definitely an option technically . <EOS> i've looked into uh costs of uh touch screen methods and what not , <EOS> they seem to be uh you know almost as cheap as a button method at this point . <EOS> okay . <EOS> we're doing okay . <EOS> 'cause it seems like an interesting option <EOS> especially because then you could have like your primary screen just be these you know four or five basic functions , <EOS> you can have <EOS>
yeah , <EOS> the biology . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> but it is soft . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> it's soft , <EOS> and <EOS> and that's kind of what the um <EOS> mm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> and people could <EOS> the powerpoint slide thing said would be good for r_s_i_ , <EOS> so maybe it is but <EOS>
yes , mm . <EOS> oh . <EOS> which one does this plug into ? <EOS> hmm i think it's all there . <EOS> that one . <EOS> h <EOS> i can't did you <EOS> could you see it on you screen <EOS> when it <EOS> oh yeah . <EOS> that's kind of strange . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> they don't sell green rubber plants . <EOS> alright . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> but then i d i don't think we can ever make to a twelve and half . <EOS> yeah , you can , <EOS> you should you have to lose <EOS> but then we have to scrap l_c_d_ display , <EOS> we have to scrap uh <EOS>
um <EOS> yep . <EOS> um and i think if we wanna keep our costs down , we should just go for pushbuttons , <EOS> 'cause then we can have a a simple chip <EOS> and it's simpler , <EOS> it's it's cheaper to make pushbuttons than it is a scroll button . <EOS> so in terms of uh in terms of uh economics it's probably better to have pushbuttons . <EOS>
um i guess you know game or something um in real life <EOS> um so yeah basically <EOS> i want to i'm just gonna you got <EOS> of course you can discuss that , <EOS> i'm thinking about um uh proposing that since we've got this weird blend of ourselves and our roles that we just don't ask , don't tell . <EOS> um so um <EOS> if you say something about marketing , right , sorted , <EOS> um y is <EOS>
yeah . yeah . true . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i'd say it's about a a twoish ? <EOS> two . <EOS> three . <EOS> it's about in the mid in the middle somewhere , <EOS> maybe , yeah , i dunno . <EOS> two . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> maybe three , yeah . <EOS>
alright . <EOS> okay , the entrance is uh more to the left . <EOS> warning . warning . <EOS> you're correct . <EOS> okay . <EOS> but but but i think this part <EOS> yeah , but i think <EOS> oh no you made another mistake . <EOS> oh . yeah , there are a lot of mistakes , because the walls are thick like this . <EOS>
ah <EOS> that's for the <EOS> it's kind of a l_e_d_ for indicating your battery <EOS> and as well as it's like a blinking one <EOS> you know <EOS> you can keep it aside . <EOS> locati . location . <EOS> ah okay . <EOS> mm-hmm . mm 'kay . <EOS> i like the shape of them , <EOS> i do like the
mm . <EOS> so when your dad's sitting there , overriding your decision , going no we're gonna watch this , you can bring out your own remote and be like zap , no we're gonna watch this . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> w and plus i think <EOS> mm . well <EOS> actually some households do have three and four t_v_s <EOS> and they would have a remote for each one , <EOS> so . <EOS>
if you just click return it should be okay . <EOS> it'll get rid of the message . <EOS> or not . <EOS> if you hit just hit return and it should get rid of the message . <EOS> oh there we go . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> that's what i was looking for . <EOS> right . so we've got function <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> okay , <EOS> fruits . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> if possible . <EOS> okay . <EOS> and remember as as i said last meeting , we really have to build a fashion remote control <EOS> and uh the colour of the um the society will be really it will be seen in the remote control . <EOS> so you will have baba and david jordan you will have to work together on the prototype <EOS> and you will have next time to show us um modelling a cl a clay remote control , <EOS> so you will have to model model something . <EOS>
you have one with a flag , and one with a banana and one that's a spongy <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so when you buy your remote you can buy <EOS> feel to it . <EOS> you can <EOS> various coverings . <EOS> mm various covers . <EOS> what's it called ? <EOS> cust you <EOS> personalised , yeah . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> okay . <EOS> um obviously trying trying to avoid being tacky there , but it could um tie-in very easily with your your lime and lemon idea . <EOS> yeah . okay , <EOS> do we have a corporate colour scheme ? <EOS> i didn't know . <EOS>
alright . <EOS> only if they're piranhas . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> they they're easy , you know . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> alright . <EOS> who wants to go next ? <EOS> i'll go . <EOS> i drew a kitty . <EOS> it's pretty much impossible to tell that's a cat , <EOS> but i love cats . <EOS>
mm yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> and moreover it it has um l_c_d_ and everything , <EOS> so that uh you know uh we minimise the pressing of the buttons anyway . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> it's varied . <EOS> yeah . six ? <EOS> okay , so we give that a six , <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay , f_ . <EOS>
yeah , <EOS> that depends on on on the remote . <EOS> uh . <EOS> i think it's it's a <EOS> i think <EOS> because i have two televisions at home . <EOS> one is horizontal , <EOS> one is vertical , <EOS> so it depends . <EOS> yeah <EOS> it does it doesn't really matter , <EOS> but <EOS>
you want me to draw something ? <EOS> product manager <EOS> okay , <EOS> let's go , <EOS> i will try . <EOS> everybody <EOS> oh , <EOS> maybe we should bring kemy here . <EOS> kemy is really good at drawing . <EOS> many <EOS> i think everybody should do it , <EOS> so . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm . <EOS> and symbols that you don't necessarily understand , <EOS> symbols you're meant to understand that you don't . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> um . <EOS> so simplification of symbols you could think of . <EOS> when they're <EOS> when you've got the main things on the front of it <EOS> and a section opens up or something to the other functions where you can do sound or options kind of recording , things like that inside it . <EOS> 'cause it doesn't make when you pick it up it doesn't make it really complicated to look at , <EOS> it's obvious what you're doing , um . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> okay . <EOS> the <EOS> okay ? <EOS> uh so uh <EOS> fancy look and feel , what do you think ? <EOS> f <EOS> between o one and seven . <EOS>
meeting . okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah it it has yeah it has to be user-friendly . <EOS> so it's hasn't it's yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> alright . <EOS> th the least amount of functions possible <EOS> so it's easier to get to know how it works etcetera . <EOS>
my name's frank . <EOS> i'm . <EOS> thank you . <EOS> uh let's see . uh <EOS> let's start off um with a little presentation . <EOS> uh now first i'll tell you a little bit about the setting . <EOS> you can see there are a few cameras here . <EOS> they'll record uh our actions <EOS> and you'll have wires and microphones that will record your voice . <EOS> uh there are also some microphones there <EOS> but th um you don't have to pay a lot of attention on those , <EOS> because it will uh disappear when you don't attend to it . <EOS> so <EOS> is there a project documents folder ? <EOS> there are some notes in it already i see , some documents . <EOS> uh i'll start with the presentation kick off . <EOS> is being modified by the administrator . <EOS> uh okay . <EOS> let's do it read only . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> great . <EOS> so , the engineering centred ones uh provide a lot of functionality , <EOS> but it can be a little bit overwhelming , <EOS> so the user centred ones just focus on ease of use . <EOS> uh and this sort of overlaps with what the marketing person uh , reissa , <EOS> because uh we we need to find out what what people want before we make firm decisions on this . <EOS>
cafe forte <EOS> cool . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> especially when we're all from the same general region . <EOS> right so okay , <EOS> success on the whiteboard . <EOS> you can harness the awesome power <EOS> a little bit introductions we talked about some of our c_d_s <EOS> and things we like about the city <EOS> you know , <EOS> i think we'll <EOS>
no use to draw on the board itself . it's just slows down . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> just old fashioned kinda blackboard style . <EOS> but you might as well do it in normal computer style . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> like . <EOS>
the details of the components' design , as you can see there , what we have is the board , main board of the remote control . <EOS> the underside , that's pretty cheap piece of of technology really <EOS> top left side you can see the chip , which is the , what we were talking about , this was is the device to recognise the signals the input , <EOS> and it passes it on to a row of um further transistors and stuff like that on the right side that actually amplify the signal , <EOS> which later on is being , is being transferred to a infrared lamp <EOS> which then um of course shines infrared light onto the television <EOS> which then will recognise what signal um it's getting and will do what you tell it . um <EOS> so much for the the workings of the of the uh remote control itself . <EOS> its job is to wait for you to press a key , then to translate that key press into infrared light signals , um that are received by the television . <EOS> when you press a key um you complete a specific connection . <EOS> the chip senses the connection and knows what button you pressed . <EOS> it produces a morse code line signal specific to that button . <EOS> right . pretty clear . <EOS> transistor amplifies the signal and then sends the m sends the signal to the l_e_d_ which translates the signal into infrared light . <EOS> the sensor in the t_v_ can see the infrared light , and seeing the signal reacts appropriately . <EOS> this is the circuit board from the other side . <EOS> um the lower part of it , <EOS> i don't know if you can see that properly , <EOS> with the green greenish board is is what we what we saw in the first the first slide just flipped over . <EOS> um you can see the circuit board itself . <EOS> that's the cheapest uh way to make electronic connections basically on the market . <EOS> um what you do is you have , don't have cables , but you have the connections actually in these in these lines on the on the board . <EOS> these are the actual keys that are being pressed . <EOS> they close the electric circuit . <EOS> that then sends the signal to the chip on the other side . <EOS> that would be behind here . <EOS> um which uh sends it over to the transistors and all that stuff that <EOS>
okay . <EOS> uh okay <EOS> now i hope everybody has a little bit more insight in the functions we all have <EOS> and what we are doing right now . <EOS> um i'm the project manager <EOS> so i'm here to mess things up <EOS> and uh tell you some new uh requirements . <EOS>
oh , that pen drawings . <EOS> uh no , <EOS> i think uh when it is uh in word and you have saved it in the shared documents folder , you can show it there . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> oh , only in word , <EOS> okay . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> so um <EOS> do you say this <EOS> um s uh uh <EOS> you got like uh sort of a i believe there ? <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> so um <EOS> you want to put a display over here ? or not ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . i think so . yeah . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> do it via the email <EOS> so that rather than coming you know <EOS> if you get the information just before the next meeting that's fine . <EOS> come along with it in the next meeting , <EOS> we can discuss it then <EOS> and take whatever action is appropriate . <EOS> but if you get it well before the next meeting , let everybody else know <EOS> 'cause that might have an impact on their uh on what they come up with effectively at the next meeting . <EOS> okay . <EOS>
yep . <EOS> supposed to work on the user interface concept , <EOS> and you're supposed to keep watching the trends . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> um and specific instructions will be sent by our our coach . <EOS> i think we should do as many features as uh start with all of them right now <EOS> and eliminate them later in the process , <EOS> that's my suggestion . <EOS>
no no no not at all . <EOS> it's more more just that we we think about like what it is we're trying to achieve , <EOS> so and then we have one one sorta theme that we stick with . <EOS> do you know what i mean ? <EOS> okay right well um <EOS> so thoughts about the actual shape of the thing . <EOS>
with cherry on top . <EOS> oh , that <EOS> okay . <EOS> i would say flying saucer . <EOS> oh unid uh unidentified remote control , so <EOS> it's more appropriate , somehow . <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> that's that's pineapple remote control . i think it's fine . <EOS>
so <EOS> we could the the <EOS> the more complex we make it of course , the more expensive <EOS> to the industrial design department . <EOS> expensive it's gonna be get uh . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> but people have said that they would <EOS> well <EOS> younger generations of people have said that they would pay more for a speech recognition remote . <EOS> so <EOS>
yeah <EOS> because we have to take into account that we are gonna b we are gonna sell uh four aro around four million <EOS> so when we speak about these numbers uh the price of a chip is uh price of a chip is very cheap . <EOS> so <EOS> i'm okay for designing um a ne uh less yeah a a kind of universal uh r_c_ yeah . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , but that's unnecessary . <EOS> what do i think is necessary necessary item ? <EOS> it's pretty cool . if you slide it open , it lights up . <EOS> that's that's really fancy , but i don't know if it's reachable . <EOS>
yes . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> so top down . <EOS> hmm ? <EOS> yeah , <EOS> you sl uh you let it slide in the docking station . <EOS> do we have to design that w as well ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> uh i'm not sure . <EOS> the docking station ? <EOS>
mm . <EOS> so will become eight soon ? <EOS> so it's a good evaluation , i think . <EOS> it's very promising . <EOS> yeah , well <EOS> it's a bit biased . <EOS> we have a good price <EOS> and uh . <EOS> huh . <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
no no . <EOS> that it would be too long to develop . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i think that should be the same . <EOS> oh yeah . <EOS> because i received that email from management board <EOS> and they seems to tell that that if we want to be on the market as early as possible we should uh focus on t_v_ more where it seems that the market is more important . <EOS> so maybe it's a good decision . <EOS> i dunno . <EOS> what's your opinion ? <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> system . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> a whole system , <EOS> 'cause of course they can't give you uh uh anything comparable to the internet for the <EOS> yeah i mean , it <EOS> yeah . <EOS> well i think it's interesting how it all went together , <EOS> like i had the stuff about how me how rubber's cheap , <EOS> and you have how people want it to be spongy , and <EOS>
yeah it's <EOS> so we have the the second version also with the different uh button configuration . <EOS> the second version is also simpler , <EOS> we d uh we had just uh i have to put the microphone also . <EOS> so basically th it's the same uh <EOS> yeah . <EOS> basically it's the same uh things uh uh as uh i presented before . <EOS> but here we have uh we have uh four buttons for navigation . <EOS> press one button uh acting as a a enter button . <EOS> so um yeah according to what you said it's more robust to the user . <EOS>
okay yeah , <EOS> they <EOS> mm yeah . <EOS> yeah okay . <EOS> that's that's below that then . <EOS> it's uh twelve buttons . <EOS> yeah , okay . <EOS> just so you get that . <EOS> okay , but it's rather important . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah okay , just we just missed that . <EOS> but um i'll just uh <EOS> i'll get back to later . <EOS> f the form well , we've taken that from the ipod , other popular technical device . <EOS> so um should be popular . <EOS> um <EOS> the f uh the buttons creating ? <EOS> uh if you <EOS> that or all round shapes , not uh rounded corners . <EOS>
price-wise . <EOS> true . <EOS> we've already got it . <EOS> i can pass you on that email from my uh guy in uh guy down the hall . <EOS> sounds good . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> what do you think on it nathan ? about the voice rec ? <EOS>
okay . <EOS> right . <EOS> what if we gave it a charger ? <EOS> and on the charger , just like a phone , like you get a portable phone and it's got a charger , <EOS> and if you d leave your phone somewhere , you push the button to find it , and it finds th the phone beeps for you . <EOS>
sorry ? <EOS> indeed absolutely yes , <EOS> tha that's um <EOS> okay <EOS> and uh w we need to keep in mind here that the uh we want to sell this for for twenty five euro um , <EOS> we want to m make an overall profit for the the company of fifty million euros <EOS> so we're we're looking at selling a lot of these um ag across the the entire planet <EOS> and and we're looking at a gross profit of fifty percent . <EOS> it needs to cost twelve euros fifty to make . <EOS> um so we're not only looking at a a very trendy original product , <EOS> we're looking at making it at a very good price . <EOS> um , okay , um <EOS> would anybody like t like to to start by giving their o um sort of quick views of of current remote controls . <EOS>
uh . <EOS> we could make it titanium instead of rubber . <EOS> you don't make a remote control of ah . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> it it i <EOS> yeah , <EOS> it also uh it also takes one point less . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> but uh a wooden remote control only helps for uh old people we discussed , <EOS> yes ? <EOS>
this is this is the a a a remote that's been opened up <EOS> and that's the the back of the interface . <EOS> mm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> and this is a push-button one , <EOS> so you see these little little buttons here , they're little rubber rubber buttons <EOS> that go through onto the the board at the back <EOS> and they push these buttons here . <EOS> um and we <EOS> that's the basic construction that we've got to got to accommodate . <EOS> we got to have something that pushes the little buttons <EOS> that um talk to the chip <EOS> that encodes the message <EOS> that sends the the message to the receiver . <EOS>
mushroom design , yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> th that's why if you put it in the table , be careful , somebody will eat it . <EOS> to integrate , you know yeah . <EOS> i don't think <EOS> i hope nobody will eat it . <EOS> you know , to integrate the fruit aspect , <EOS> you know the the in <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> i think that's <EOS> yeah , but but i what i'm uh very very much doubtful how how uh far it will work , <EOS> because a speech recogniser like i it it has its own uh uh problems , issues . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> distance problem ? <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> well then you have to buy a new one , <EOS> it's very good for marketing <EOS> new remote ? <EOS> maybe , <EOS> or an update , software update . <EOS> a firmware upgrade or something , <EOS> but from where ? <EOS> firmware update , you say . <EOS>
'kay . <EOS> hiya <EOS> , i'm ryan . <EOS> um i'm the user interface designer . <EOS> um likewise i've three different roles for each stage of design . <EOS> um the functional design is looking at the tex technical functions of a remote control . <EOS> um in the concept design , the user interface , <EOS> how the user reacts with the the product . <EOS> and the detailed design um sort of like the user interface design , <EOS> what they might be looking for , uh things like fashions , <EOS> what makes wha <EOS> how we're gonna make it special . <EOS> that's about it . <EOS>
yeah , that's still part of the design . <EOS> sure . <EOS> and adam , we can keep that in ? <EOS> yeah , i believe so . <EOS> so <EOS> i mean i don't think anybody could actually stop a remote being lost , <EOS> 'cause that would mean doing something about the human element , <EOS> but i'd like to think that we've done something about finding the damn thing once we have . <EOS>
oh , <EOS> good point . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> once you've , yeah once you'd learned how to use it , i think it is a lot easier . <EOS> so i'd i'd give it a four . <EOS> okay . <EOS> i think i'd give it a four too . <EOS> it's a pretty high learning curve , <EOS> it'll be easy once you've done it , <EOS> but <EOS>
alright , so n sorta if if if we're gon if we're gonna go with the idea of um uh of feedback , sort of remote finder , then that kinda stuffs that one out then . <EOS> that was more of a a gimmick . <EOS> do you think ? <EOS>
check check check check . <EOS> hello . <EOS> oop . <EOS> why won't it wake up ? <EOS> is it on ? <EOS> the power light doesn't work . <EOS> you turned it off . <EOS> but how ? <EOS> ah , <EOS> there it is . <EOS> okay . <EOS>
by the way , <EOS> why was your cat uh red ? <EOS> because uh my cat is red uh at home . <EOS> and i have red hair , <EOS> so uh must be red . <EOS> oh , okay . <EOS> oh . <EOS> oh , yeah , sure . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> okay and the twelve fifty twelve uh twelve <EOS> uh-huh . <EOS> twenty five euros . <EOS> yeah , i think it's <EOS> twenty five euros , yeah . <EOS> twenty five euros . <EOS> no , it's not so expensive . <EOS> it should be fine . <EOS>
mm-hmm , that's very true . <EOS> um . okay . um <EOS> got product evaluation as well . um . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> you see i don't <EOS> some of these things kinda logically follow the others . <EOS> how can t <EOS> product evaluation , doesn't that come after actually seen a product prototype . <EOS>
i think it's that little <EOS> uh there's the rubber on the right , i think . <EOS> it's magic . <EOS> oh i see . <EOS> oh okay . <EOS> i'll get rid of the bear <EOS> okay that's great . <EOS> okay , so we start off with a um battery suppl <EOS> uh no , <EOS> a power supply <EOS> which we'd probably get <EOS> it's probably gonna be the battery . <EOS> um <EOS> we then have a particular button , <EOS> which may be <EOS> that's obviously there's lots and lots of different buttons . <EOS> um but this is how the basic system works . <EOS> um that sends <EOS> after you press that that sends the message to the chip , <EOS> which um then sends <EOS> it sort of interprets which button you've pressed <EOS> and then sends the appropriate message to the sender . <EOS> um . <EOS> so that's . that's the remote in itself , <EOS> that's the components of the remote <EOS> and how they work together . <EOS> so this is the uh user interface . <EOS> um this is the chip itself , <EOS> which then , and that's the that's the infra-red sender . <EOS> and then on the separate thing we have on the on the television we have a a receiver . <EOS> and the sender sends a message to the receiver . <EOS> 'kay . <EOS>
i think , i think you're on to something <EOS> because we need to escape the traditional shape of a remote . <EOS> maybe something that looks nice on a table is would be good , even though and hand-held the same time . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> complex . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> not user friendly . <EOS> search for the buttons , which one is which <EOS> and uh <EOS> no . <EOS> no . <EOS> boring . <EOS> boring , <EOS> it's not fun to use a remote . <EOS>
uh i think mm <EOS> not really . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i think the main thing is the usability , that's where we can uh make it a special product . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> uh <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> to k to keep it simple when you <EOS> sorry <EOS> i thought about it , yes . <EOS>
then <EOS> and then the technical funct you are the technical function , <EOS> so so you are the working design . <EOS> so you have a working design and then a functional design . <EOS> and the marketing manager is coming up with some user requirement specification , <EOS> like friendliness , and what we just discussed in general . <EOS> that would be your idea . <EOS> and , of course , price . <EOS> that it , that it , that the price is a good price . <EOS> i mean , the price is given , but , that was <EOS>
oh . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> injury . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> s <EOS> i think so . <EOS> it's like right in the <EOS> but if you're zapping <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i don't think it will f <EOS> your thumb might get a little bit uh <EOS> yeah , that's what i was thinking . <EOS> we may have to do some more research into other strain injuries that we don't know about . <EOS>
only , like , only in the sense that it it can recognize a set a set target kind of word an <EOS> yeah . <EOS> this is just more like a poi pois yeah . <EOS> it's designed it's designed as a fun kind of thing , <EOS> but i guess you could use it as uh as a way to implement uh <EOS>
fruity ? <EOS> fruity . <EOS> grass green . <EOS> yeah . like that . <EOS> the round shapes , and soft material m materials like the rubber . <EOS> it should be soft uh i it should feeling spongy or s sponge bob like things . <EOS> th <EOS> mm . okay . <EOS>
no <EOS> s say t two . <EOS> two ? <EOS> or two . okay . <EOS> so , two , yeah ? <EOS> yeah . two yeah . yeah two yeah . <EOS> because tomorrow this will be more appealing <EOS> because you can add lot of sophistication on that . <EOS> because then you you have it uh d you have lot of things which you can include <EOS> for the people to <EOS>
no . <EOS> you could put a game on it . <EOS> when the t_v_ dies you can play with the remote control . <EOS> no ? <EOS> easy . <EOS> mm mm . <EOS> okay um right <EOS> so you're gonna have the three different sets of of functionalities , <EOS> um i mean do you wanna group them into s head of the snowman , body of the snowman , inside of the snowman , <EOS> is that what you're thinking ? <EOS>
folder , <EOS> yes . <EOS> so no okay <EOS> have a look at that one . <EOS> okay . so uh <EOS> what we're going to do first is um <EOS> so <EOS> you can read . <EOS> you have to uh draw uh a favourite animal on the whiteboard <EOS> and um and say why it's your favourite animal . <EOS> so <EOS> and you have <EOS> this is just to try it out <EOS> and we have to uh use a different pen colours and different thickness of the pen . <EOS>
um i think it's important that you should be able to when you when you press the buttons it'll actually pick up the signals from kind of anywhere <EOS> and you shouldn't have to like contort yourself <EOS> and twist your remote control to get it the t_v_ to actually pick up the signal . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> but <EOS> right . <EOS> well <EOS> but why are we why are we aiming for a technological advancement ? <EOS> everything we're talking about is ease of use and simple <EOS> and that doesn't necessarily mean more technology , <EOS> in fact it could use it could mean , not . <EOS> if <EOS> they might be overwhelmed with with remotes that have too many buttons and too much technology . <EOS>
it's for the t_v_ . <EOS> i'll still give it five . <EOS> five ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> you are romantic , really . <EOS> i would say two . <EOS> two three five two three fi and two . <EOS> so it's r <EOS> so it's somewhere three point five i think . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> and um try to draw <EOS> or maybe you should guess what i'm drawing , eh . <EOS> good . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> no . <EOS> it's a sheep . <EOS> dinos <EOS> dinosaur . <EOS> seal , a seal . <EOS> beaver . <EOS> a beaver . <EOS>
i'm sure if you can sell a a speech recognition remote control for twenty five euros everyo everyone will s will buy it . <EOS> actually i'm not so sure <EOS> because i'm the <EOS> you know if i was using a remote control to , say , turn the volume up because i can't hear it very well , i don't really want to you know drown out what people are saying by talking you know when i'm when i'm instead of pressing up on on a remote control . <EOS> you know if there's some there's some dialogue all of a sudden that i can't hear , i'm trying to actually find out what's being said , <EOS> so maybe speech recognition gets in the way more than it helps . <EOS>
just the channel um uh what i mean is uh <EOS> forward . <EOS> li like a web browser , <EOS> so <EOS> oh , okay . <EOS> but uh um there's also a button to uh go to the channel you've been before . <EOS> six seven eight or five . <EOS>
right . <EOS> we could probably maybe shrink the profit margins <EOS> rather than selling for twenty five , sell 'em for thirty , <EOS> but that's something that we can have finance deal with . <EOS> um , i say that we provisionally go with the touch screen <EOS> or wh y wh what was your thought on the matter ron ? <EOS>
um i think we're almost done , yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> oh oops . <EOS> sorry man . <EOS> s <EOS> uh okay , still didn't manage to get down all the last bits <EOS> so we had rechargeable and uh . apples . <EOS> mm-mm-mm-mm-mm . <EOS> 'kay , so we came up with that , that's okay . <EOS> what's supplements ? <EOS> supplements . <EOS> uh uh . <EOS> see . <EOS>
no . <EOS> rubber material . <EOS> and rubber . rubber material . <EOS> rubber material . <EOS> and that's the only thing we have left . <EOS> yeah we need the the chip on print to be able to support the the screen and uh and f audio function . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah , yeah yeah yeah yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i mean you have it for the portable phone , so why not yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> and even i think a little light . <EOS> um or even a maybe a vib a vibrating thing . <EOS> i dunno but someth because it's usually under the sofa . <EOS>
yeah that's right . <EOS> i mean you could just provide with an optional . <EOS> so so <EOS> yeah <EOS> i i so if don't don't buy now they can buy i in the future . <EOS> so in in that way you're actually keeping the cus the same customer , <EOS> attracting them to come back in again and again . <EOS> we're not trying to follow the microsoft <EOS> and we don't want to the m <EOS>
right . <EOS> with with <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> we can design different remotes for different people , like for aged people there will be big buttons and you know . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> well that's that's <EOS> but in a family <EOS> in a family there will be a aged person , children and a middle aged but they cannot buy three different remotes . <EOS> they would like to buy just one and um just one which can be used all the three uh <EOS>
hmm . <EOS> it's the most important part , i think . <EOS> but <EOS> and the home base is something like that , something simple . <EOS> well <EOS> and then i just ordered the the buttons a bit . <EOS> uh basic buttons . on-off , mute . and th maybe two others , i dunno . text buttons . <EOS>
well , <EOS> have a think about it . <EOS> i mean <EOS> i'm i'm certainly op it seems <EOS> like yeah <EOS> it it seems like it's certainly do-able <EOS> isn't it . <EOS> i mean um <EOS> or if we can't have a full mobile phone maybe a remote that has some other kind of useful function . <EOS> the clapper . <EOS> no i mean <EOS> no , <EOS> good idea , good idea . <EOS> we'll see what see what <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> no , <EOS> i mean <EOS> would y would you replace your controller with a controller with similar function if you do not have some some function inside it that <EOS> it's not really the we <EOS> we can add for example some function like for browsing in internet , so or something like that . <EOS> but uh i think a user need <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> . <EOS> yeah . yeah , <EOS> unless you are a all the time sitting . <EOS> yeah , so it's kinda <EOS> yeah . <EOS> well we've banned them from <EOS> yeah , i i think it is ergonomic . <EOS> i used to send fifty texts a day , you know , <EOS> and i never got repetitive strain injury from that , <EOS> so i find it quite hard to believe to be honest . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> okay , uh what i'm not understanding here <EOS> mm . <EOS> is uh , okay , advanced chip on print , which i presume is like one p_c_b_ and that's got all the electronics on one board including the um infra-red sender ? <EOS> . <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
mm . okay . <EOS> speech recognition . <EOS> n yeah , that's all . <EOS> the next one ? <EOS> so i come up with a simple design , <EOS> just keep the v navigation buttons . <EOS> yes , that's a good idea , i think . <EOS> we d we don't we we don't need really much buttons to i if we have a screen to navigate on on the t_v_ so uh <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm . i th the thing i like about the uh the uh joystick <EOS> is that uh you you you then basically you can then basically put it i mean for for t_ t_ for t_v_ remote alone , you could put <EOS> um i mean there are like i say the the <EOS> the main things people do with a t_v_ remote control is the volume and the channel . <EOS> you can pack all that onto was onto a single control . um . <EOS>
if it's latex if it's latexy <EOS> it's kind of and then it <EOS> we would have to find a way to protect like the chip and all that , <EOS> i dunno . <EOS> but <EOS> um , mean <EOS> a kind of thing that <EOS> an uh i if th <EOS> my understanding of a latex case is that it's in fact hard to protect stuff inside , <EOS> but that it's covered with the latex , <EOS> which is spongier and softer on your hands . <EOS>
yeah , <EOS> so this one and this one . <EOS> uh we ha we have um single <EOS> what ? are we ? <EOS> oh yay . <EOS> oh , <EOS> we already on nine . <EOS> we have double curved . <EOS> the single . <EOS> single nee single curved . <EOS> double curved was uh uh see uh ju three dimensional . <EOS> but it isn't three dimensional , <EOS> it isn't curved in a l <EOS>
yeah , <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i don't know if it's possible to to watch something on t_v_ <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> oh . <EOS> w i i think it it would be better to to stick to the remote control and not to bother the t_v_ to to to print these things . <EOS> well it wi it will be still more expensive , but for the l_c_d_ and this stuff is no problem in the price . <EOS>
'cause it's s it's separate isn't it , <EOS> it's not part of the <EOS> it's it's just an addition thing <EOS> it's um <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> 'kay . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> 'kay shall i pass on to you now ? <EOS> i think <EOS> in fact , it wouldn't really cost anymore , would it ? <EOS>
uh <EOS> still that was one of the requirements we had . <EOS> it's yeah but it i don't think it's such a problem just putting the logo somewhere . <EOS> uh f like y we can we can put some uh double r_ <EOS> yeah , but we decided to have something yellow and red , for the costs . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> yep . <EOS> say a button's about <EOS> say a button's about this size , right , <EOS> so you would still have plenty of space for a slogan , say even for that . <EOS> okay . <EOS> looks good . <EOS> yep . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS>
that's not cool . oh well . <EOS> anyways . um alright , yeah , so um <EOS> i'll just do my presentation on the working design uh . <EOS> oh there we go . <EOS> okay um <EOS> just at the m yeah the whole sort of method of how the remote control works . <EOS> uh the basic function of the remote control is to send messages to another sh system , the the t_v_ or the d_v_d_ player or whatever . <EOS> um and it does this uh by well , you need to start off you need an energy source <EOS> and this energy source will feed into an integrated circuit chip <EOS> and the circuit chip is the part that actually composes the different messages uh within the remote <EOS> um which will then be sent to the uh the television , the d_v_d_ to tell that what to do . <EOS> um and you need a user interface , <EOS> which controls the chip and thus the messages <EOS> and uh the user interface is that's basically just you kn the s sorta design of the actual remote which you hold in your hands and what buttons will be on it . um <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> there you go . <EOS> um before we move on <EOS> yeah , i'm just <EOS> do you wanna plug in ? <EOS> okay . <EOS> i need that cable . <EOS> thank you . <EOS> yeah . um . <EOS> one thing i do need to do we need to look at , is the costs . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah frequency . yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah decoder . <EOS> yeah well this was actually all i got around to do . <EOS> i mean i dunno if i'm too slow for this stuff , but uh <EOS> blank . yeah okay . <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> i change channel like this , <EOS> m uh i want to go to twenty five , and then to ten , uh-huh mm yeah . <EOS> dash . <EOS> and then back to the one i was before , <EOS> so there's whichever it was . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i guess so . yeah . <EOS> true . <EOS> okay . <EOS> uh the user interface designer should specify the technical functions . <EOS> right ? yeah ? <EOS> and the marketing uh expert should come up with user requirements . <EOS> uh did any of you already do some work on this part <EOS> or <EOS>
i don't know how much , <EOS> but <EOS> yeah , <EOS> our division has developed a new speech recognition feature , the integrated programmable sample sensor simple speaker u unit . <EOS> this is a very small electronic unit , <EOS> will give a standard answer after it recognise a question . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> oh , <EOS> there's no e <EOS> okay . <EOS> so the plus and then <EOS> yeah . <EOS> oh . <EOS> i <EOS> okay . <EOS> but <EOS> would you have to go zero plus one if you wanted to go to channel one or two ? <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> mm hmm hmm . okay . <EOS> mm . <EOS> okay . <EOS> so , <EOS> we can think of buttons like in the telephone to send messages or things like that . <EOS> mm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> but we'll see . <EOS> how the this remote ? <EOS>
well , <EOS> we don't put put in any fancier technology yet . so <EOS> hmm . <EOS> then uh some more technical things . <EOS> i don't know what it is , <EOS> but it should be there i think . <EOS> um this is the normal circuit board , like a chip board in in a lot of uh things . <EOS> w <EOS> so we d we just need this and this transistors and resonators . there's all these kind of things . <EOS>
how do you feel about that ? <EOS> i mean <EOS> i think that uh if we're talking about it being one of our main selling features , being environmental and without the batteries and what not , <EOS> although it does still have a battery <EOS> so i'm not sure that you know what the sell is on that . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> so not a not a remote control who uh uh which can uh can be used for television and a d_v_d_ and radio <EOS> and or just only <EOS> yeah . i think so . <EOS> uh but i have some points . <EOS> can i show them on the on the big screen ? maybe ? <EOS>
yeah , yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> well <EOS> but i suppose as long as it's quite a subtle design , <EOS> um even if the design kind of changes , <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> we c maybe can imply a fruit shape possibly . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> ah d d but if <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> well . yep . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> design which we saw there . <EOS> mm . <EOS> but could be done , of course . <EOS> okay . <EOS> uh so these are the decisions that we do need to make by the end of this meeting . <EOS> um for our components concept we need to come up with the energy source , um the chip-on-print , and the case . <EOS> probably case um material . <EOS> and probably a shape also . <EOS> um and then for the user interface concept we need to decide what the tape , what , what the type is . <EOS> and what kind of supplements we'll have . <EOS>
so you were saying the scroll buttons <EOS> yeah . <EOS> th there was a specialist type of remote that we could think about , um . <EOS> there was children's remote , <EOS> where um they just had a very limited range of buttons <EOS> and they were b uh bright and colourful <EOS> and um you you could program them so that they could only look at certain channels . <EOS>
at twenty five . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> that's um <EOS> to give you a pretty good idea of where you're looking . <EOS> so <EOS> that's four million of them ? <EOS> something like that ? <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> that's fifty million euros . <EOS> in order to make fifty million euros , and you're only getting twelve and a half each <EOS>
potato mango shaped remotes . <EOS> i'm gonna have to <EOS> i'm claiming it intellectual property . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i can't believe a whole day is gone . <EOS> i don't feel like it's been that long . <EOS> i know . <EOS> get sucked in . <EOS> mm i haven't gotten questionnaire eight yet . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> of course . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , so i talk about the problem . <EOS> and then i i look at the user manual <EOS> they are a hundred pages thick , <EOS> so we don't want that . <EOS> so i propose the easy to use uh prototype . <EOS> you can navigate on t_v_ screen <EOS> and we can the user's preference <EOS> and we need to have the t_v_ connected to internet so we end in order to access the t_v_ programmes by x_m_l_ <EOS> and we need some to do some preprocessing . <EOS> from the technical aspect , the processing should be done on the t_v_ set than on the on the remote controller , right ? <EOS> and then we the speech recognition as uh harry says we may just put in we may k_i_v_ . <EOS>
yeah , <EOS> what about price , is that gonna go on there as well ? price of materials . <EOS> mm , yeah , price . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> we'll put price up at the top . <EOS> not that we actually know anything about it , <EOS> but we can we can pretend . <EOS>
okay , yeah . <EOS> whatever . <EOS> okay . okay . <EOS> limit the number of buttons , <EOS> user friendly . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> but i suppose nine's not really excessive . <EOS> i suppose it does make a good pattern . <EOS> i suppose with nine you've got the the like the last one which makes the tenth means you uh it's like uh multiples you can put them together so you can make any number . <EOS> so with that we'd kind of by-pass any problems with <EOS>
oh . <EOS> ooh . <EOS> so <EOS> we'll just <EOS> if we can just itemize what's in here , <EOS> we've got this <EOS> it's a solar cell thing <EOS> right ? <EOS> right <EOS> uh we didn't really touch on that <EOS> but it it's in there , <EOS> yep . <EOS>
alright . <EOS> everyone else ? <EOS> i'd say it's technologically it's not it's not unique , <EOS> i mean it's it's just it is just pushbuttons um , <EOS> so i i'd give it a four . <EOS> think i'm gonna go with the four as well . <EOS> mm 'kay . <EOS>
oh . <EOS> maybe , i hope so . <EOS> yeah , yeah i'm sure . <EOS> yeah , that's true . <EOS> the second key feature is that uh s circle channel um selection . <EOS> in the traditional key uh traditional controller use button to to select the channel <EOS> but now we have a s circle , so we can turn this ball to t to select channel . <EOS> so it's quite convenient for user to use it . <EOS>
hmm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> um , the case , we have a few options , plastic , rubber or wood . <EOS> um and then as far as the way it's shaped , we can do standard boring flat , <EOS> which we probably don't wanna do , <EOS> curved or very sexy double curved . <EOS>
oh , they're okay so they're not like dressed as a carrot <EOS> they just have like pictures of fruit on , okay . <EOS> so we're not gonna have a remote control in the shape of of a banana , <EOS> just maybe <EOS> no no , not not yet , not yet . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> that's uh yeah , is that <EOS> that's a good idea . <EOS> so that's great . <EOS> that's great . <EOS> yeah , it's getting <EOS> it looks more like a pineapple . <EOS> sorry . <EOS> what's the use for that ? <EOS>
i would say so . <EOS> following that briefing we did . <EOS> but maybe more like two <EOS> 'cause there's no like pictures of fruit , it's just sort of naming it by a fruit . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> like um the colour scheme names and stuff . <EOS>
i wanna find our if our remote works . <EOS> me too . <EOS> oh . <EOS> okay . um here's the agenda for our last meeting . <EOS> um after the opening we're going to have a prototype presentation , <EOS> then we're going to discuss the evaluation criteria and the financing of our remote . <EOS> then we're going to evaluate the product and i think the whole production process , <EOS> and then we're gonna close it up , <EOS> and we have forty minutes , <EOS> so <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> . <EOS> uh so the fruits and vegetables in combination with the spongey material . <EOS> um well technolog technological innovation , we've covered that pretty much i guess . <EOS> um and easy to use , i don't think that will be problem . <EOS> so my point of attention is especially this part . <EOS> that this will be a crux . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> and that wouldn't put off the kind of older generation either , <EOS> 'cause everyone can whistle or clap , <EOS> and they wouldn't have to be kind of scared of this new technology . <EOS> well , so maybe a clap rather than a whistle would be <EOS> on the basis that if we've got if we're catering to the whole age range , you want something that's easy to do , <EOS> now something that doesn't like whis uh <EOS> well i i i don't know . <EOS> well if you think that more people can whistle than clap then that's fine , then go for that option , <EOS> but if <EOS> i would have thought that more people could clap rather than whistle , <EOS> so uh so clap option . <EOS>
yep . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> well <EOS> i started making an overview for myself , um what i had to do , <EOS> 'cause we have three design steps <EOS> and in every step i have a s specific task to perform or whatever . <EOS> so i had to uh , i dunno , make an overview for myself about what i have to do , <EOS> and kind of let it work in to get ideas about
well , <EOS> the kinetic battery . <EOS> in the battery , that's it . <EOS> i <EOS> kinetic battery is a big one , <EOS> so . <EOS> how many people would notice that , though ? <EOS> mm . <EOS> but it <EOS> but we know it's there . <EOS>
yes it is . <EOS> uh i don't know the name o o in english uh <EOS> this <EOS> it's not a fruit it's a vegetable . <EOS> is it an e apple which has <EOS> it's like a pumpkin or <EOS> yeah ? pumpkin . <EOS> green . <EOS> green . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay <EOS> so we'll go two . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah ? <EOS> okay , <EOS> and um design is simple to use , simple in features . <EOS> well yeah , <EOS> i mean it's really basic looking <EOS> isn't it ? <EOS> i mean i'd give that nearly a one . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> we have change the electronics to from from the the the sample sensor to regular chip . oh . <EOS> so <EOS> we have to delete the the sample sensor , i think . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> but we have you the the voice recognition , <EOS> no ? <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> you could have an option to turn it off . or <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> perhaps , um . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so that would solve the problems with the t_v_ kind of speaking to the remote and changing its own channels . <EOS> mm . <EOS> so uh <EOS> any sugges <EOS> well , any conclusions ? <EOS>
speaks for itself . <EOS> thing uh <EOS> yeah , <EOS> it speaks for itself . <EOS> um and as you uh may have heard , the documents in the shared folder uh can be uh showed on this screen . not in y the the my documents . <EOS> so if you wanna show something , put it in the shared folder . <EOS> uh this uh is very straightforward , with the save , the print , the undo , the blank , the select , the pen . <EOS> well , <EOS> i don't uh gonna explain it all , <EOS> because i think you know uh how it works . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> i find them <EOS> they can be a bit annoying , <EOS> especially , like you know if i'm watching t_v_ i have have to have three separate remote controls of in front of me , you know , one for the t_v_ , one for the digital box , one for m the video recorder as well . um . <EOS> and also they tend to they tend to be a bit confusing , <EOS> they've got too many buttons on them <EOS> uh too too sort of too sort of complicated <EOS> when all i really wanna do is switch on and off , <EOS> change the channel , <EOS> change the volume . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> actually i i didn't understand very well this trace speaker lost control . <EOS> well <EOS> okay , good . <EOS> so you're having a basis station . <EOS> okay . <EOS> your <EOS> usually your remote sits on that . <EOS> so you <EOS> and it's that's why it can have chargeable batteries . <EOS> now let's say <EOS>
first on the market . <EOS> in added expense . <EOS> mm . <EOS> and the price was like it was twice the w assembly cost . <EOS> and would it have to be twice that ? <EOS> it could be like coulda had the assembly like maybe fifteen euro . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> uh . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> everything worked . <EOS> av available there . <EOS> right . <EOS> and so more time uh w might have improved the the quality of work , <EOS> is what you say . <EOS> okay . <EOS> so <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> but i don't think i think if you're gonna make a remote control only to operate a t_v_ , you there's not much you can gain on um having as few buttons as possible . <EOS> 'cause i think there are pretty many remote controls that can only operate a t_v_ , <EOS> which already only have the minimum number of buttons . <EOS> i don't think there's much to be gained in that area . <EOS>
okay . 'kay . <EOS> yeah sure . <EOS> ooh , it's vibrating , that's strange . <EOS> oh , god . <EOS> right , okay . <EOS> have i got to keep this here ? <EOS> does it matter ? <EOS> i think you'll have to you can't <EOS> it'll have to <EOS> this can't be pulled . <EOS>
impressionist . <EOS> can't draw . <EOS> is that a whale ? <EOS> um . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> um , well anyway , <EOS> i don't know , it's just the first animal i can think off the top of my head . <EOS> um . yes . big reason is 'cause i'm allergic to most animals . <EOS> allergic to animal fur , <EOS> so um fish was a natural choice . <EOS>
i'd <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> with the articulators . with bells on it . <EOS> that's that's better too . more accurate numbers . <EOS> technologically innovative . <EOS> well , <EOS> we're getting rid of the locator thing <EOS> which which <EOS> yeah <EOS> which is a shame . <EOS>
tomatoes . <EOS> a different shape <EOS> or okay , <EOS> not the example i would choose , <EOS> but you know what i mean to t sort of <EOS> and th apparently the feel of the next couple of years is spongy , <EOS> uh not something i i've come up with a <EOS> though if we can get around to getting piloting , i thought maybe a casing option like uh <EOS>
uh <EOS> fair enough . <EOS> there's some other options , if you're a t_v_ slut <EOS> like i am <EOS> like smallville terrible television show <EOS> but i happen to love it , <EOS> it's rubbish <EOS> but i love it . <EOS> oh , smallville . <EOS> i went to high school with tom willing actually . <EOS>
beep beep beep . <EOS> uh pla <EOS> the locator function . <EOS> i'm ha <EOS> okay . <EOS> it's great . that's great . it's a great feature . <EOS> um beep beep beep <EOS> so <EOS> beep beep beep <EOS> beep beep beep <EOS> be shut up . <EOS> beep beep beep <EOS> okay . um no no no tha that's alri <EOS>
perfect . <EOS> no no . i don't have . <EOS> no . <EOS> so <EOS> is this <EOS> is there anything else i need to do from a marketing point of view for the next meeting ? <EOS> um yes <EOS> i come to that uh uh <EOS> maybe it would be interesting if you could look um for the cost inventories of other devices , if you're using speech recognition or something like that . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> and yeah , and then just to um put the main function of the remote control in in words . <EOS> um so the findings uh were um that the main function of the remote control is is just sending messages to the television set , <EOS> so this quite straightforward . <EOS> and uh w some of the main functions would be switching on , switching off , <EOS> uh then the user would like to switch the channel <EOS> um for example just m changing to the next channel to to flip through all all of the possible channels , <EOS> or then mm uh the other possibility would be that um she might just want to choose one particular channel , <EOS> so we would need the numbers . <EOS> and and also the volume is very important . <EOS> um <EOS> um i als <EOS> okay . <EOS>
yes , features . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> well then again if we're gonna um do the speech recognition thing we're gon there gonna be some buttons that are gonna have to be added for that for the recording of the the speech . <EOS> so that that's where we're gonna have to do <EOS> maybe we can eliminate one of the mute buttons , instead of having two mute buttons . <EOS> and um then maybe we can do something with the um <EOS>
sure . yeah . <EOS> okay , yeah . yeah . <EOS> okay , yeah . <EOS> oh <EOS> really . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> oh . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> thing . <EOS> um but only the <EOS> i think that if you can put different kind of devices in one remote control , it makes it a lot easier as well . <EOS> it's uh <EOS>
yeah , <EOS> yeah . <EOS> an <EOS> yeah . <EOS> like , p personally for me , at home i've i've combined the um the audio video of my television set and my d_v_d_ player and my c_d_ player . <EOS> so they w all work actually function together <EOS> but i have different remote controls for each of them . <EOS> so it's sort of ironic that that then they're in there <EOS>
yep . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> under the cost . <EOS> mm-hmm . yep . <EOS> um . <EOS> so uh <EOS> i i think we've done an amazing job <EOS> in uh <EOS> yep . <EOS> okay . <EOS> well done us . <EOS> coming up with what <EOS> so uh <EOS> one two three four five six seven eight nine ten eleven . <EOS> eleven divided by eleven's one so equals average of one . <EOS>
yeah . it should be . <EOS> and it's also conformable to the size of your hand . <EOS> i mean if that's too big , it's a rubber remote , so you can , you know <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> 's great . <EOS> change that . <EOS> so d does that uh what mesh with what you guys were hoping and for and expecting or does it <EOS>
for example . <EOS> but <EOS> yeah , that . <EOS> yeah okay , <EOS> but but yeah , that's just <EOS> that's an a an added feature . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> but let's not uh go too wide about the those things , <EOS> that's that why we're here . <EOS> it's it's a nice idea , <EOS> but i think that's we wel later in the stage . <EOS> i've one little question about um a total touch screen <EOS> or uh um a p <EOS> yeah , a partial , <EOS> uh because i think uh elderly people may be uh not used to uh a touch screen , <EOS> so they want the the the normal functions like teletext , volume changing , um uh to be uh , yeah , kinda traditionals <EOS> uh and uh the the the the other functions , the more difficult functions uh to be uh maybe on the touch screen , <EOS> but to keep this as uh normal as possible , to keep it accessible . <EOS>
it's one to seven , right ? <EOS> the <EOS> so it meant three , <EOS> okay . <EOS> oh yes <EOS> sorry then <EOS> , then i would say two or three . <EOS> wait , <EOS> what's the scale , one to seven , right ? <EOS> one's high-ish isn't it ? <EOS>
looking like <EOS> um , 'kay . <EOS> innovation . <EOS> the first one , not really muc <EOS> basically there is no innovation in the first one compared to what exists in the market , <EOS> right ? <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> do we <EOS> no but except for the design of the surf . <EOS> you should be rea <EOS>
but i think uh <EOS> well . yeah , well <EOS> it's basically it's it's here . <EOS> yeah okay , <EOS> m maybe we cho should put that on top , <EOS> and buttons we we don't use on , in the bottom . <EOS> yeah , that's better . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> i i would <EOS> if i had my perfect remote control , i'd probably just have no numbers at all on it because they're just in the way . <EOS> they don't really do anything . <EOS> maybe you know i <EOS> although i do also find flip-open doors a bit of a pain because sometimes they can break off or or whatever , <EOS> but maybe a door that you can you can permanantly remove or permanantly have on would be good . <EOS> um but i think definitely you need to to keep the buttons down to a minimum , but not not let that kind of interfere with the functionality of of the device . <EOS> um <EOS>
okay . <EOS> uh also <EOS> well in in euro in in paris and and milan the <EOS> in paris and in paris and milan the the current trend of uh of clothes , furniture and all this <EOS> all this fashion it's it's fruit and the the the theme is fruit and vegetables . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> i don't know anything about this , <EOS> but nah . <EOS> um <EOS> yeah , <EOS> we just decide not to put it in , <EOS> because it's too difficult . <EOS> i dunno . <EOS> well <EOS> it it would be would be a good feature feature . <EOS>
well , my little sister got for christmas she got one of those key finders that's like a key-ring , and you have to whistle in a certain frequency for it to work . <EOS> and then she would laugh and it would start going off in her purse , and you couldn't turn it off . <EOS> so it became highly irritating . <EOS>
yeah , <EOS> so isn't hard to lose you . <EOS> isn't hard to lose , <EOS> yeah . <EOS> isn't hard to lose . <EOS> so it's a two . <EOS> yeah , you can lose it , <EOS> so i don't <EOS> you can make it a three i <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> it could be cased on the outside <EOS> and t everything could be inside . <EOS> 'kay . <EOS> um so <EOS> we want it to be modern , fun , sturdy , <EOS> um <EOS> so our form and our function . <EOS> um we want it to be um easy to find . <EOS> um <EOS> what else it what else do we want it to to do ? <EOS> so we want it to be universal . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> does kinda make you wonder , <EOS> i mean , <EOS> how much can you do with a remote control ? <EOS> it's like inventing a new car . <EOS> yeah yeah , <EOS> you can <EOS> it's still gotta be technically car shaped <EOS> or it won't fit on the road , <EOS> you know ? <EOS>
we should do it . yeah . sure . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> uh . <EOS> certain systems already exist , i think . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> then you also have to have different languages if we go international . <EOS> then uh it's y it's yours to do a french and dutch and english <EOS> and
yeah . <EOS> so our big decision then is like how do we do um like <EOS> we have to decide on the details <EOS> and we have to decide on well n not exactly the details , <EOS> but d do we have uh <EOS> what type of casing ? <EOS> i personally like what you were saying about the plastic with the rubber . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> and yours was called interface concept ? <EOS> interface , yeah . <EOS> this one ? <EOS> well , for some reason i can't get it to just go to that slide directly . <EOS> yeah . um . <EOS> okay , it's the very right one . <EOS> you see at the bottom , <EOS> it's kind of difficult to see , but you have like a d sort of s division between the bottom like , where the logo is , <EOS> and if we have the replaceable section , it's like the top . <EOS> it doesn't necessarily replace the entire top . <EOS> and so you have that one piece that stays and the rest just sort of clips in . <EOS>
how many b battery is there ? <EOS> how many , excuse me ? <EOS> battery . <EOS> well uh f battery , we use uh about uh <EOS> is it n the two a_a_s batteries in it . <EOS> a_a_ rechargeable batteries . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> rechargeable of course , <EOS> because we have the charger . <EOS>
right before the eur the world cup . world soccer . world cup soccer , <EOS> they need those things that they have their hands g occupied and they need to be able to talk to the con remote control . <EOS> which sport season ? <EOS> football . <EOS> so so <EOS>
yeah . you have a presentation ? <EOS> uh yeah <EOS> just a <EOS> four . <EOS> participant four , yes . <EOS> evaluation . <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> so you can go . <EOS> we can go through . <EOS> okay . <EOS> so <EOS> i made an evaluation <EOS> and the the evaluation criteria is made according to the users' requirements and the market trends we talked about uh during the previous uh meetings . <EOS> so you can go through <EOS> and <EOS> okay so uh <EOS> we have uh six points . <EOS> we <EOS>
mm . <EOS> it's a fancy idea uh it's quite nice , <EOS> but then i don't th i dunno , <EOS> either you if you wanna watch the telly you're in the room , <EOS> you are gonna <EOS> yeah , exactly . <EOS> basically , we're we're desi we're designing and marketing a television remote control unit . <EOS> we're not w w w w designing something that you can plug in a headset to and and you know connect to your laptop computer and stuff . <EOS> it's uh <EOS>
that'll be <EOS> then we have uh have to ask the user to press it several times . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> you cannot make a phone to your boss saying twelve fifty is really no no , <EOS> he he he i i <EOS> really low , no ? <EOS>
okay . <EOS> yep . <EOS> can i have your cable please ? <EOS> thanks . <EOS> okay so i was looking at trend-watching . <EOS> um unfortunately i wasn't given too much information . <EOS> i was given a brief executive summary , and then an update on some recent fashion trends that we might like to look at . <EOS> and then i'll just tell you some personal preferences that i got from that . <EOS>
alright . <EOS> oh . <EOS> um anybody have <EOS> i got more master classes , <EOS> anybody else wanna like take a master's class ? <EOS> oh . <EOS> it's really funny that you got spam in your work emails . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> but check it out . <EOS> so like <EOS> there are all these like links , they don't go anywhere . <EOS>
it's gonna be hard . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , yeah . <EOS> and if it's repetitive movement it is gonna be only four buttons that you're constantly pushing , <EOS> but um <EOS> um um worth the risk , i think . <EOS> i like how it fits in the hand though <EOS> so i i'd go with a two . <EOS>
the only problem is we're using a latex overlay so it actually would go over top of everything and have holes for the buttons , <EOS> so i was thinking maybe instead of doing that what we could do is leave a space for where the logo should be . <EOS>
oh it's probably just you , 'cause you're the project manager . <EOS> . <EOS> well , just questionnaires . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> sell trying to sell your things . <EOS> yeah , stuff . <EOS> um okay . <EOS> do <EOS> oh have you guys found out if we can if we can e-mail stuff to each other ? <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> um , i haven't had some marketing data and basically every product is marketable . <EOS> so purpose , as william already said , i would put it to simplify the interaction with t_v_ <EOS> to make make it as simple as possible . <EOS> and to summarise i i would say it's it should be user-friendly by being easy to use , rather than having a lot of complex button <EOS> because you can have an engineering maybe having hundred buttons <EOS> and maybe having uh a remote control which has the main features like volume control or channel ch changing the channel or whatever . <EOS> but we are to to make it unique so that people want to buy it , <EOS> will this two features together . <EOS> so what the concept is to have a flip-top model . the <EOS> main functions such as which are like often used will be on the top <EOS> and the complex functions which say you you can say like the y young generation or trendy generation want to pr say programme their favourite channels or whatever , can be put in the middle part of the f flip-top . <EOS> so it's like it could be accessed by a wide ra range of uh audience <EOS> and we can punch in new f features such as uh added features such as shock proof body <EOS> and maybe a design to appeal to a lot of people . <EOS> findings most people prefer us user-friendly rather than complex remote controls <EOS> because there are times like uh people have used a remote control for say a year or something and they they are not used maybe thirty to forty percent of the buttons <EOS> so it's not of no use of punching in the uh trying to put in those things in on the top of the remote control and try to confuse the user . <EOS> as we saw we we have to make a profit also <EOS> so we we can maybe go for an economies of a higher production <EOS> mm by fifty million we said ? <EOS> yeah , <EOS> with that i think we'll be able to achieve economies of scale also , <EOS> so we can give in add in more features and make it less costly . <EOS>
yeah . yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay number six . <EOS> can someone read it out ? <EOS> or <EOS> mm . <EOS> does this prototype match the operating behaviour of the average user . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> um yeah . <EOS> so that was mainly that the statistics <EOS> we said <EOS>
uh i see i see . <EOS> that's where you <EOS> yeah . <EOS> that was that was my my intuition of what the scroll wheel would be . <EOS> ah i see i see what you're talking about now . okay . <EOS> it's just it's basically it it's just a f look and feel thing . <EOS> it has the same exact functionality as two buttons . <EOS>
one . <EOS> 'kay <EOS> five . <EOS> right . <EOS> ooh i don't know . <EOS> right . one ? <EOS> five . <EOS> five . <EOS> five . <EOS> two . <EOS> okay so do we just add it up and divide it by four ? <EOS> is that what the company does ? <EOS>
yeah , <EOS> i dunno . <EOS> okay . <EOS> we have to do a lot of testing before we can do that . <EOS> mm yeah well <EOS> yeah , i think so . <EOS> we make uh make uh , we can make th th the new remote control very flashy . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , i think that's that's going to be one of the the main things we'll have to ask is whether people have strong preferences either in staying with someone or in uh not staying . <EOS> but andre , just a comment abou about your your previous uh request . <EOS> i i don't think that anyone will provide you information such as who doesn't want to be with whom . <EOS> that's a typical uh output of ex uh research in expert systems . <EOS> these are the rules that you never get . <EOS> but uh you can get them through a proposal . <EOS> so you propose a set-up , where people are with other peoples <EOS> and they will find politically correct ways to tell you that uh they don't want to have a view on the mountains , but they prefer to have view on the old town , <EOS> so they would be in the toilets . <EOS> they would um p prefer to be in another room . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i know , <EOS> i think at the very start of today i like wrote a whole load of stuff , didn't click note on one , <EOS> then went back and wrote one tiny wee thing on the another page , but then did click note , <EOS> and so i'm quite worried that i've just written over the top of it or something , <EOS> but they'll have my paper anyway um <EOS> and haven't done that since . <EOS>
of the remote ? <EOS> you wanna try to come back to yours , and limit yours a bit ? <EOS> uh yes , <EOS> i would like to include this feature which is called as voice recogniser . <EOS> y <EOS> okay . mm-hmm . <EOS> okay . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS>
whitebo <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> and um well it should work uh <EOS> i've read it from my uh from some colleague that it should work with some kind of toolbar . <EOS> i didn't find out yet how it work , <EOS> but maybe one of you did , so um <EOS>
fashionable people will buy it . <EOS> oh , i will create desire . <EOS> that's okay . <EOS> we can create a commercial where they think that all their needs will be met . <EOS> this will help them find the one . <EOS> that's right . <EOS> ri they'll be sexy with it . <EOS>
yeah , <EOS> we can <EOS> yeah ? <EOS> okay . <EOS> so . <EOS> no it doesn't . <EOS> it seems that that we want to sell like four million units from the first meeting . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> okay . <EOS> four million . <EOS> okay . <EOS> maybe we can uh we can look at the new requirement i receive from the management board and discus discuss all function we want to have . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> uh-huh . <EOS> yep yep . <EOS> yep . <EOS> showing me age , <EOS> i don't know what i c ipod covers are like . <EOS> yeah yeah . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah , well <EOS> i i didn't know that <EOS> but yeah they're kind of <EOS> it's just kind of a rubbery <EOS> and that way <EOS> you know <EOS> spongy like is something that people wanted <EOS> and it just sort of stretches over <EOS> and that way i think probably helps protect it a little bit too as well <EOS> and <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> well yeah . uh semi-transparent . <EOS> yeah , just only yeah , that's right . <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay , fine . so i i think it's very fancy . <EOS> so i'll give it a <EOS> so <EOS> yeah , that's how i think . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> because <EOS> s uh slightly smaller . <EOS> so you have to keep that side flat . <EOS> yeah , but if we flip it open only as much as that . <EOS> okay . <EOS> so it works like a mobile phone flipping , but y you know , as long as that side's flat , than that will work . <EOS>
something something new . <EOS> and the other things that they've made <EOS> and i like put down some like inspirational words like that i got from looking at the pictures . <EOS> so the motto is um we put the fashion in electronics <EOS> and um so it's something that is sleek and stylish but it's still functional , you know ? <EOS> so i'm kind of thinking , you know like those phones that they have , the new generation ones , where they don't actually have any buttons on them and stuff like that . <EOS>
f if you wanna design it that way . <EOS> . <EOS> organic , <EOS> and i think would look rather co i mean mi rather cool . <EOS> i mean my drawing there doesn't doesn't do it justice , <EOS> it makes it makes it look more a little bit more like a vibrator than a than a uh than a remote control , <EOS> but uh . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> not just yet . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , got the email . <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> in it <EOS> i think the tools that they were given , the tool set that were given to us are fancy but they don't support collaboration , i think that's the word . <EOS> they don't support the team working together , you know , <EOS> they're still very individual tools . <EOS>
keep the navigation <EOS> but <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> well , f four five buttons , it's sufficient . <EOS> it's easy to build , <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah , that's right . <EOS> it does not consume much power . <EOS> . <EOS>
uh-huh . <EOS> well twenty five euro , i mean that's um that's about like eighteen pounds or something , <EOS> isn't it ? <EOS> or no , <EOS> is it as much as that ? <EOS> sixteen seventeen eighteen pounds . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yep . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> i'd say so , <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
um we want to be modern , um fun , different . <EOS> uh it needs to be sturdy , um easy to find , <EOS> so we gonna have that locator function . <EOS> um and we want to be different . <EOS> um and then we went over a couple of different ideas . ball-shaped phone . the keyboard shape . <EOS> um we decided that it should probably be one-handed . something we could use with one hand . <EOS> um and that was our last meeting . <EOS> so um <EOS> why don't um <EOS> do each of you have a presentation ? <EOS>
yeah , <EOS> i'm just go <EOS> i'm trying to give you some trends about what should be done and what the users would like to have <EOS> and then thi this would i guess converged to the user interface designer wi and then industrial designer . <EOS> and <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
so it has to look uh uh uh unique , <EOS> but <EOS> unique . <EOS> the company is about our uh th th their own fashion , their own style . <EOS> yeah , i reckon <EOS> yeah . <EOS> but old people are not looking for that . <EOS>
job . <EOS> again uh uh um , andre , i think that the only realistic way we can do is to speak for our for ourselves . <EOS> i can tell you according to what i know now where i would like or would be ready to be , <EOS> but i really don't see how i could decide for uh maggie or pierrette or whoever else on the list , that they should be there . <EOS>
and also we found our team found that speech recognition is it's like an up-and-coming thing <EOS> they really <EOS> consumers are really interested in it , <EOS> and since our findings found that people are willing to pay more money for a remote for it to be more high-class we could consider it . <EOS>
sure . <EOS> three and a half . <EOS> um you can skip straight to a channel using these buttons . <EOS> okay . <EOS> um , were gonna have the volume control here , <EOS> but um because we've got the the l_c_d_ and the jog-dial we just thought we'd um use that as the volume . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> um then <EOS> it does look very cool . <EOS> then cat's going to present the evaluation criteria that we're going to be evaluating this against . <EOS> then i need to say some st a few things about finance , <EOS> 'cause we have to check that it's within the finance criteria . <EOS> um and then we'll be making sure that our product fits both the evaluation criteria from cat and the financial limits . <EOS> um and then we uh will have a brief evaluation of the whole process of production and design that we've been through . <EOS> so we've got forty minutes . s <EOS>
i'd <EOS> i could draw sorta the ball idea . <EOS> my original idea was just simply sort of a sphere , <EOS> where maybe you <EOS> this is where it's connected together , <EOS> and then when you open it out , it could fol it could be maybe flip , like a flip phone , <EOS> and then when you fold it out the middle <EOS> maybe a hinge that'll have to be the strongest part of it . <EOS> if that if we did use a hinge , or if it was just two parts , <EOS> and then you'd have <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah <EOS> wh <EOS> is that possible to use or no ? <EOS> that is possible , <EOS> that <EOS> well <EOS> that actually depends on the television , <EOS> but i think i figure that would be <EOS> th there's just <EOS> well , yeah well , <EOS> does it have to depend on the television ? <EOS>
yeah yeah . <EOS> so i've chos i shou <EOS> i think it's it's it's a one . <EOS> enough features ? <EOS> personally , <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i think once you've <EOS> 'cause you have the channel features <EOS> b <EOS> uh you have the uh screen features , audio features , <EOS> the <EOS> you have all buttons on it which you'd like , microphone extra , l_c_d_ screen extra , scroll thing extra . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i would . <EOS> it's bright . <EOS> it's <EOS> it still has your traditional black . <EOS> it's curved . <EOS> it's not <EOS> there's no sharp <EOS> angles to it . <EOS> yep , not angular . <EOS> mm . <EOS> i'd say , when it comes to the ergonomics , the form and stuff , yes that's definitely more beautiful than your average . <EOS> however the colour , we don't have a say in that . <EOS>
uh i do not think so , <EOS> i think it's just to try out the whiteboard . <EOS> are we all gonna draw a cat ? <EOS> only animal i could thin i could draw . <EOS> i know . <EOS> ah . <EOS> its a sort of bunny rabbit cat . <EOS> you can tell it's not a bunny rabbit by the ears . <EOS> um i suppose it should have a mouth as well , sort of <EOS>
uh you should be able to and <EOS> yeah , there you go . <EOS> yeah , you might . <EOS> get it right over , <EOS> okay , thank you . <EOS> ah . <EOS> look at that . <EOS> okay , um , <EOS> i'm going to look at the functional requirements from the marketing point of view <EOS> and uh obviously our starting point with marketing is always market research . <EOS> um , so that's where we started , <EOS> we used our our usability lab , the company's usability lab , <EOS> we did our usual selection methods to get a cross-section of the general public , <EOS> male and female , <EOS> all age groups from fifteen upwards <EOS> and um we observed them in the lab , <EOS> just their general use of the remote control , <EOS> you can see we had a hundred subjects there . <EOS>
um , <EOS> yes <EOS> it's if it's fancy you put one , <EOS> if it's really unfancy it's seven . <EOS> one , right okay . <EOS> if it's somewhere in between you put four . <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah , something . <EOS> okay . <EOS> does it feel fancy ? <EOS> no . <EOS>
yeah , <EOS> i think we need both . <EOS> mm . w <EOS> what uh <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> what wh uh what i was thinking is that there is this uh separation between what the channels are on t_v_ and how they are numbered on the remote control . <EOS> if we can do with away with that , our product can be really popular <EOS> uh in the sense that uh a person can say , i want to watch uh i_t_v_ one instead of saying that i want to go onto channel number forty five . <EOS> yeah , so if uh if something like that can be incorporated , <EOS> some kind of <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> but that's that's very expensive uh <EOS> yeah . <EOS> and maybe th then make this thicker also than the centre . <EOS> give it <EOS> i would give it a female shape <EOS> but uh yeah . anyway . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> and ergonomical shape . yeah . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> could i can i interject to ask a question there , <EOS> is that appropriate ? <EOS> you're saying the triple a_ batteries are small or the surrounding it ? <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> um no no , <EOS> if you if you look at if you look at most remote controls they're quite they're quite chunky <EOS> and that's because of the size of the batteries , <EOS> they have to be obviously this certain size to fit those batteries in . <EOS> yeah <EOS> the the <EOS> well you can you can get the sort of circular round ones <EOS> but i'm just wondering about power consumption <EOS> and how much you need to send the data across . <EOS> um , and d which leads sort of onto the next point about 'em being small and easy to carry round . <EOS> um , now the ones at the moment are small <EOS> but i was just wondering if we could look at something a bit smaller . <EOS>
yeah . yeah . <EOS> w <EOS> like like this um this uh market research thing says number of times per hour that it's used , channel selection a hundred and sixty eight <EOS> per hour ? <EOS> times per hour . <EOS> right . <EOS> yeah . yeah . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> good . <EOS> what's the next ? <EOS> so <EOS> three's <EOS> uh how well it goes to the target demographic . <EOS> mm . <EOS> so <EOS> we're d we're still thinking twenty to forty year olds ? <EOS> that's <EOS> so <EOS> twe twenty to forty , yes that's <EOS>
so that's all . <EOS> mm . <EOS> a remote control ? yeah . <EOS> and were there any factors that weren't important in the survey , that they said we don't want ? <EOS> s uh we didn't find out any such point . <EOS> uh yes , there could be , but we couldn't find out any , so <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> doesn't have to be used very often <EOS> that's right , yeah . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> and it's <EOS> yeah . <EOS> but it's a but it's a nuisance . <EOS> and it's a nuisance very close to the to um to actually purchasing it , <EOS> so it's something that you're likely to be thinking about . <EOS> if you if there's w i <EOS> if there's one in the shop that's that says it can avoid much of that nuisance , you might be favourably inclined towards it . um mm . <EOS>
true . <EOS> right . so , um , <EOS> this one's a bit unclear to me to be perfectly fair , um . <EOS> i got this slide from the coach <EOS> and i'm not sure what it's connected to . <EOS> um so i guess we are going to discuss um our project process um <EOS> and that is gonna go into my report . <EOS> so <EOS> i guess this is the point where we go um uh out of role it looks like <EOS> and talk about our satisfaction for room for creativity and so forth <EOS> and how that all worked , i guess , um . <EOS>
yep . <EOS> i like those printer cables that just have the two little butterfly clips like that . <EOS> it's really quick . <EOS> oh yeah , they're good aren't they , yeah . <EOS> right okay , <EOS> um yeah here we are . <EOS> uh as a note we'll do this <EOS>
very nice . <EOS> great . <EOS> uh , what do we <EOS> oh . <EOS> do you hear the eraser buzzing while you do that ? <EOS> yes i do . <EOS> yea <EOS> right . <EOS> so , now that we know how to use the whiteboard , <EOS> um , the next , um , thing we need to address is our financial department , to meet our our budget , <EOS> um or not meet our budget but more , um , like what kind of , uh , selling range we'll be looking at , <EOS> um , wanna make this um selling price of twenty five euros . <EOS> and so we have to , um , come up with a way to , to create a , a uh remote control , where um <EOS>
oh you press a press a button to talk , and the the t_v_ the t_v_ sound turns off . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> no <EOS> it could be command control kind of thing . <EOS> it requir recognises particular sequence and then it gets activated . <EOS> means you say <EOS> you should say like does that , remote control being on or be on kind of thing , and then remote control comes in the picture for the speech recognition . <EOS> because this kind of thing means speech is there from the t_v_ also . <EOS> so there should be something command controlled , you start and then you stop . <EOS> it's like v_i_ editor , you are having two modes similarly . <EOS> otherwise it's just lying idle . <EOS>
yeah , they do it with other materials as well , yeah . <EOS> and chew 'em up . <EOS> okay then , uh , let's move to agnes . <EOS> sure . <EOS> oh , i'm sorry . <EOS> s you're <EOS> you are in participant three . <EOS> one point three , yeah . <EOS>
i'm in the sales i'm supposed to explain them what to do . <EOS> we have to define exactly what our product is , from uh <EOS> yes , <EOS> so can you explain uh what exactly the product is ? <EOS> from what i had in mind we're supposed to be marketing coffee , <EOS> is that right ? <EOS>
yeah i think it's about five . <EOS> five ? <EOS> that's really low . <EOS> well yeah well we have to use uh plastic <EOS> so it's probably gonna be <EOS> yeah i suppose mm 'kay . that's <EOS> um <EOS> yeah , <EOS> company logo . <EOS> could we have used an entirely rubber frame to it ? <EOS> was that an option ? <EOS>
mm . <EOS> so it you wanna group all the different kind of types of functions together , you know . <EOS> that's <EOS> i think it's a good idea . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> that's s that's sort of the um <EOS> but i i'm <EOS> my hope here is that i'm putting out this information so that we can then say okay , well how do we collectively move on with it . <EOS> um i i haven't brought out one specific marketing idea , <EOS> although my sense is that what we should try and think about is what are the current trends in materials and shapes and styles , and then use that . <EOS> but not let that confine us technologically . <EOS>
yeah , <EOS> different remote controls , <EOS> yeah . <EOS> uh for the use of different uh devices . <EOS> yes . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> your stereo and your t_v_ <EOS> and uh . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> perhaps that's an idea . <EOS> yeah <EOS> but then again you you still have a lot of buttons , <EOS> so <EOS>
uh <EOS> yeah ? <EOS> yeah okay . <EOS> but uh uh for a user to to remember , if i press that button it goes to that channel . <EOS> well <EOS> if you said a favourite <EOS> yeah , <EOS> but isn't it hard to remember ? <EOS> like favourite one and <EOS>
single curve . <EOS> single curve should be fine , so . <EOS> case , what's the ca <EOS> yeah . <EOS> oh , what <EOS> mm . nearly . <EOS> ah we have one <EOS> and then one euro left . <EOS> um . <EOS> maybe don't bat no battery , only solar cells . <EOS> i think there's a problem with the push push button . <EOS> we only need maybe just one . <EOS> just one . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so yeah , you will have <EOS> so one button , and s <EOS>
futuristic . <EOS> that was that was a sorta simple idea i had <EOS> and then you know you could about <EOS> uh-huh . <EOS> right , <EOS> it would almost be like a ball . <EOS> so that was just just an idea i had . <EOS> i don't know whether anybody else has other ideas ? <EOS>
mm no . <EOS> no <EOS> i think i <EOS> we don't wanna be tacky <EOS> if we've got a kind of different shape anyway <EOS> um the fact the m the material that we would be using would be cheap , <EOS> so we could make it red , we could make it um psychedelic , <EOS> you know , we could make it black and white zebra stripes , <EOS> but that's not really what we're focusing on , <EOS> what we're focusing on is the m you know <EOS> yes . <EOS> so we could just pick anything . <EOS>
the twelve buttons that you see there . <EOS> twelve buttons . <EOS> that's um one piece of rubber but it's gonna have twelve button things underneath so <EOS> yeah . <EOS> functionally you're gonna have to intercept <EOS> so four is a good estimate for <EOS> do you think ? <EOS>
so you got the option of having different colours or different textures . <EOS> yeah . this is possible . uh uh y are you sure ? <EOS> i th i th i think <EOS> yeah i think yeah it should be possible like what we do with the mobile phone , yeah . <EOS>
s <EOS> yeah . <EOS> when the user requirement is essentially just to operate the t_v_ , <EOS> so yeah , <EOS> of course we haven't actually got a working model yet . <EOS> so what do you think you will personally give . <EOS> seven . uh . <EOS> i would say seven . <EOS> seven is good , yeah , isn't it ? <EOS> i can't <EOS> true or false ? <EOS> no sorry tr one is true . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> right . <EOS> right . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> like using the menu to be like , enter your name into the screen like on the menu options . <EOS> so that way the remote reads it . <EOS> right , <EOS> so it's got like a limited memory and programme it . <EOS> so it's sort of iffy , <EOS> but that's kind of what you'd say . <EOS>
some some <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . exactly . <EOS> well i think it's a bit too much but <EOS> maybe a <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah an orange . <EOS> well alright well this is more like purple i guess , <EOS> but it's should be more real dark blue , so the contrast with the with the fruit objects is uh pretty high . <EOS>
s <EOS> yeah , i think we're i mean before we close the meeting , we're supposed to come up with some ideas for <EOS> oh k so we're actually supposed to be doing this discussion like right now are we or <EOS> oh okay . <EOS> i thought this was just t giving us instructions for the re to do next , but <EOS>
this is what we which you can mm <EOS> s <EOS> detachable battery . <EOS> that's 'cause i'm sick of milan . <EOS> it did yeah . <EOS> yeah , for the batteries <EOS> extra battery , yeah . <EOS> exac <EOS> okay so um project process . well in fact i i did not know i didn't know really what to say here . <EOS> if uh if you have any ideas of what we can we can say . <EOS> so <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> of course it should have a on off button . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yes , well <EOS> i it should have the the the the expected functionality uh of a remote control . <EOS> mm . yeah . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> s <EOS> and it depends what application you are using it for . <EOS> you might need uh <EOS>
yes i i th that's what i mean <EOS> so i mean something yeah . yeah . <EOS> like like a book . i like this one . i like the shape of this one . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> can we have <EOS> can we think about maybe having a a non-recta non non-rectangular one , so with not just the straight little box <EOS> that's a <EOS> maybe curved or something . <EOS>
hi kate . <EOS> okay , carry on . <EOS> alright um <EOS> this is the beginning of the third meeting , the conceptual design meeting . <EOS> um our agenda should be um that we're opening the meeting , <EOS> i have <EOS> the minutes from the previous meeting are on the shared f drive at this point . <EOS> um and we should each have a presentation to make . <EOS> um we have certain decisions to make <EOS> and we have forty minutes total . <EOS> it's twenty five after two at the moment , <EOS> so forty minutes is five after three , <EOS> um which i'll be keeping an eye on the clock for us . <EOS> okay . <EOS>
sorry . <EOS> are you gonna do that ? <EOS> okay . <EOS> i'm going to um steal a cable . <EOS> um it's it's um <EOS> is that the project document ? <EOS> it's an excel file . <EOS> oh . <EOS> production costs . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> 'kay there we go . <EOS> um , production costs . <EOS> and um i have to access that as well . <EOS> one moment . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> you can have to scroll it straight r roll it straight down for for mute . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> so that's point three . <EOS> no w w w but ha <EOS> it's it's the scroll wheel <EOS> and i thought we were referring to this as a scroll spinning wheel and pushbutton thing . <EOS>
i i think there's you know that uh there are so many people today that are that are surfing are television surfers , <EOS> and i see the scroll as a as a great mechanism for surfing . <EOS> instead of going button-to-bu you just j you'd j j j j j j . <EOS> i really i really think that's a really cool thing for surfing . <EOS>
so we'll be working on the user requirements , um <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so i guess that wraps it up . <EOS> i'll see you all in thirty minutes . <EOS> okay . <EOS> i just did . <EOS>
it's a bit annoying , <EOS> isn't it ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> what do we do wrong ? <EOS> hmm . just just more like this and not uh a square . <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah okay , yeah well <EOS> yeah , <EOS> but we could do a lot of , lot more curving . <EOS> i would do it <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> then what's gonna be displayed on the touch screen ? <EOS> the extra functions . <EOS> the extra functions , <EOS> you uh you just see a menu from system functions or teletext functions , and you just choose one , <EOS> and then all all the options will become available <EOS> and you just c s yeah t scroll through them . <EOS>
that's me . <EOS> okay . <EOS> right . right . <EOS> industrial designer , you are the one , you know , you're gonna be working out kind of box it goes in , i guess so , um <EOS> whether it's what goes into the box , somehow . <EOS>
and you both agree for that ? <EOS> and you ? <EOS> i think we can improve on the design . <EOS> som someone um commented this is like a the stone age uh design . <EOS> um we have been focused all all this time on the on the technical aspect , functional aspect , but also the simplicity . <EOS> as for the design maybe we c should hire a designer to help . <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
i think both . <EOS> okay . why don't we do both . right . <EOS> yeah . both . yeah . <EOS> who starts ? <EOS> we ought to decide who starts and all that . <EOS> no ? <EOS> uh-huh . <EOS> any volunteers ? <EOS> does anyone know what they wanna draw ? <EOS>
at nine thirty , <EOS> but we could do we could have this meeting then in the afternoon . <EOS> nah ? <EOS> that yeah . <EOS> that that would be great , <EOS> because that would allow us not to move , or not to travel twice . <EOS> okay . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> very well . <EOS> so about two o'clock ? <EOS> would that be okay ? <EOS> after lunch . <EOS> it's not a very demanding meeting , so um <EOS> perfect . <EOS> um , then let me close this . <EOS>
no , i didn't get it . <EOS> uh <EOS> this one . <EOS> no . <EOS> no , no . <EOS> the third one . <EOS> oh , you didn't get anything . <EOS> no , . <EOS> it's strange . <EOS> mm . <EOS> i got an email about the dis about the discussion . yeah . <EOS>
um okay . <EOS> there's different ways of a user can use products l like a remote . <EOS> um there's a graphical use , where you you look at pictures and well on a screen . <EOS> a command line where you obviously type things in , and you get a response . <EOS> um and then it ju that's just to point out the sort of inconsistent u sort of use of interface in remotes . <EOS> you can't really see that picture well , but there's various different remotes , once again with lots of different buttons on , making it more complicated . <EOS>
expensive . <EOS> some sort of proximity <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so that can also easily be integrated because these things are small enough to to hide , <EOS> so you have one piece , you have to glue somewhere behind your stick it behind your t_v_ and the other <EOS>
how about <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> oh . <EOS> something like that . <EOS> and the buttons are more , <EOS> well it's very thick now but <EOS> yeah i understand what you mean . <EOS> that's uh that's <EOS> how about we do a uh a pop-up screen , like the laptop . <EOS> so that the only the simple functions will be visible at first . <EOS> and then if you want <EOS>
mm . <EOS> is that a large enough target market to target it ? <EOS> well , <EOS> i i i think especially in terms of growth , i think this would be a very smart group to target . <EOS> i mean s three quarters of the next age group , twenty five to thirty five are interested , <EOS> and uh with the technologies improving , if we can get these uh <EOS>
maybe we all have to agree on a common <EOS> well , <EOS> we can very easily . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> uh i think uh and need to as well . <EOS> no problem . <EOS> so <EOS> this is your <EOS> need to <EOS> uh i don't know if you we ha we have to put uh one uh f if it's better or <EOS>
yeah i guess so . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so it wouldn't be very big in either <EOS> like how big ? <EOS> this big , and then you just do that , i suppose . <EOS> what if , yeah , what if the squishy , <EOS> oh so so you're saying the squishy part's like detachable , <EOS> and you can <EOS> so so maybe one you know you can have like the broccoli squishy thing , and then you could have like the banana squishy thing <EOS> and you could get you could have your choice , you know ? <EOS>
no . <EOS> a what ? <EOS> alright . <EOS> how . <EOS> no . <EOS> no . <EOS> no . <EOS> and it's best characteristic is it's pretty much the awesomest animal . <EOS> but you have to see the movie to fully appreciate it . <EOS> okay , well done . <EOS>
nice . <EOS> oh yeah . <EOS> there's a whole branch of psychology that looks into that , psycholinguistics . <EOS> what the uhs and the <EOS> really . <EOS> there's a guy studying it here , yeah , he's studying ums and ahs or something . <EOS> filler words or ? <EOS>
you g you get electrocuted or <EOS> yeah , kinda . <EOS> so , um <EOS> you must p p uh push a little uh good . <EOS> because <EOS> and uh wait uh wait a few seconds . <EOS> it's not uh fully real-time , <EOS> so uh watch it . <EOS>
okay , i'll see what i can do . <EOS> see if i r <EOS> whether you without hanging yourself . <EOS> see if i remember how to draw a kitty cat or a rabbit or something . <EOS> and remember you have to press so it works . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> but are we going f r <EOS> right . <EOS> um that's a that's a decision for all of us . um . <EOS> so are we able to make that decision now in a sense that this is the point at which we're discussing that issue , <EOS> so would it not be best to <EOS> rather than <EOS> i mean one way is to do each of the presentations <EOS> and then make decisions going back to the various presentations as they were . <EOS> the other way would be to do the presentation <EOS> and then make the decision at that point in time . <EOS>
hmm . <EOS> you know to process that . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> so more general remote control instead of just focusing on uh on t_v_ . <EOS> that's right . <EOS> the complexity shouldn't be much higher . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> for <EOS> you said if it good for d_v_d_ then i would <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> sort of a combination . <EOS> yeah , yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> and fiddle around with it <EOS> and press it . <EOS> yeah so yeah , <EOS> kind of maybe maybe a little wider than this , <EOS> 'cause this is pretty comfortable to hold , <EOS> and then if you had <EOS>
yes . <EOS> yes . <EOS> yes . <EOS> yep . <EOS> because it has to be something totally different , <EOS> has to be total totally new . <EOS> something that nobody has right now . <EOS> yeah but <EOS> but end of the day , you're the sales guy , <EOS> so i will come back <EOS> and sit on your head <EOS> because uh you are going to give your sales projection , <EOS> okay . <EOS>
um but no they're not sort of <EOS> most people that have the money are people from the age of thirty five to fifty five , <EOS> uh 'cause they're the ones that have been working for twenty years . <EOS> um d and tha <EOS> and that's a that's quite a minority there , <EOS> so yeah , it's not even like fifty fifty that's th thirty five per cent . <EOS>
sound . <EOS> yeah yeah uh uh . <EOS> and the third development um is that the remote control should be easy to use . <EOS> um <EOS> well the first aspect uh was twice as important as the second aspect,w which was twice as important as the third aspect . <EOS> so um that kind of gets you this ratios . <EOS> so fancy look-and-feel uh is the most important uh point of attention . <EOS>
well <EOS> it looks really professional . <EOS> i know . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> that's it . <EOS> usually i would do a lot more doodling too <EOS> but i didn't <EOS> because <EOS> i know , <EOS> i felt like i needed to be professional <EOS> so i didn't like draw all over my paper and stuff . <EOS> okay , well <EOS> not entirely , <EOS> but still , i doodled less than i usually do . <EOS>
oh . should be in there . well , <EOS> i can tell you them uh from my laptop . <EOS> um teletext does has become outdated since the popularity of the internet . <EOS> so that's uh the first thing we i think we should pay less attention to uh teletext . <EOS> uh the remote control should only be used for the television , <EOS> otherwise the project becomes more complex , <EOS> which endangers the time to market , <EOS> and of course would make it more costly , i think . <EOS> um our current customers are within the age group of forty plus , <EOS> and new product should reach a new market with customers that are younger than forty , <EOS> and you talked about that before . <EOS> and uh a last point , but also very important , our corporate image should stay recognisable in our products , <EOS> which means that our uh corporate colour and slogan must be implemented in the new design . <EOS> so we have to keep that in mind . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> so i'm doing the user interface design . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah , and basically uh , as far as methods , i was i was looking looking at looking at uh already existing remotes , trying to find some inspiration from designs that are already out there . <EOS> thinking of what we can retain , what we can do away with , <EOS> uh what we what we can perfect a little bit as far as design um . <EOS> we don't want to do something that's too radical of a change , i guess , <EOS> i mean people want a remote that's familiar , that has their favourite functionalities um and and does the basics , but <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> and so people say that they typically lose it , <EOS> as you yourself know , because you probably lose your remote control all the time , <EOS> much like any small appliance like a cellphone , <EOS> and they <EOS> we need something simple , <EOS> because most people , well thirty four percent say that it's just too much time to learn how to use a new one , <EOS> and we don't want to go <EOS> we don't want to vary too far from the normal standard remote , <EOS> but i mean they do need to be able to identify it , <EOS> and r_s_i_ , i'm not very sure what that is . <EOS>
. <EOS> okay . <EOS> thank you . <EOS>
that one . <EOS> cool . <EOS> well <EOS> these are functionality requirements from the our our guys down in the the research lab . <EOS> took hundred people <EOS> and covered all the aspects of what um is needed by people and what they want to see . <EOS> um everything kinda from functionality and how individual functions are how mu how how often they're used and how much their necessary and stuff . and general opinions about current current remotes . <EOS> see that , as we kinda noticed , seventy five percent of people find their remote controls ugly . <EOS> so some kind of a new style should be incorporated that's less ugly . <EOS> uh along with um looking less ugly , if it looks better , eighty percent of people said they'd spend more money on it . <EOS> which is a a plus for us , <EOS> if we can make it look better , it'd be uh more cost effective and we can put the price up . <EOS> current remote controls do not match the operating behaviour of the user . <EOS> i can empl <EOS> i kinda take that to mean as um they they don't uh they , yeah , they only use they only work for the television <EOS> or <EOS> yeah like <EOS> as in in my flat i've got six remote controls for a stereo system , a digital box , a d_v_d_ player , a video player and t_v_ . <EOS> if it was <EOS> uh i mean th my behaviour is to use multiple things at the same time <EOS> and multiple remotes aren't really matched well to my behaviour . <EOS> uh again , seventy five percent is seventy five percent of users say they zap a lot . <EOS> i took to mean that they just they use it a lot , <EOS> they use it regularly rather than standing up and manually change channels or volume . <EOS> and uh yeah , uh <EOS> i think the big issue is <EOS> fifty percent users only use ten percent of the buttons , <EOS> 'cause uh wh if we got a remote that like <EOS> well <EOS> we'll have some buttons taken off by the lack of teletext , <EOS> but uh oh and we're going to see uh on the uh that some of the functions like audio settings aren't h hardly ever used <EOS> and used very <EOS> aren't considered relevant by the user . <EOS> so i think maybe fewer buttons , <EOS> which also make the design look sleeker , <EOS> i dunno . <EOS> uh um yeah and uh <EOS> frustrations of like people losing remote control . <EOS> i dunno <EOS> maybe some kind of system of you press a button on the t_v_ <EOS> or maybe that's b <EOS> it would have to incorporate , but like some kind of system where you can f use something else to find the remote control . <EOS>
oh . yeah , <EOS> i think that's the first . i_d_ . industrial designer . <EOS> and the second one is the user interface designer . <EOS> industry and oh . uh-huh . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> user interf okay . <EOS> and then last one's marketing , which is me . <EOS>
well if it's going to be as simple as possible then just have the remote control , there is no other function that i can see <EOS> in addition to that ? <EOS> really . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> maybe switch t_v_ on and off <EOS> uh <EOS> no you want to keep television on so that the advertising can revenue can come back to us . <EOS> or something . <EOS>
right well <EOS> oh . <EOS> wow . amazing . <EOS> it's working . <EOS> okay . <EOS> thank you . uh . <EOS> hold that . <EOS> yes <EOS> and you can put can clip it uh on your <EOS> okay . <EOS> somewhere . <EOS> okay . mm . <EOS>
yeah , that's true . <EOS> yeah without obstacles and . <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay . let's continue . <EOS> i have a meeting in five minutes , <EOS> so maybe we should hurry . <EOS> um . so we will close uh this meeting . <EOS> so we will have a next meeting in uh thirty minutes . <EOS>
well <EOS> i think , if it's rubber it needs to be <EOS> i mean you said earlier on i it should be funky . <EOS> different . <EOS> i think , it's it should be <EOS> i mean , what do you associate with rubber ? <EOS> you know like <EOS>
yep . <EOS> you'll be just thinking about what it actually what , you know , what requirements it has to has to fulfil <EOS> and you'll all get instructions emailed to you , i guess . <EOS> okay . <EOS> um . <EOS> yeah , so it's th the functional design stage is next , i guess . <EOS> and uh <EOS> and that's the end of the meeting . <EOS> so i got that little message a lot sooner than i thought i would , so <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> that's a good thing to keep in mind . <EOS> if someone's looking to buy a new remote , don't they want like an upgrade ? <EOS> i dunno . <EOS> upgrade ? <EOS> well , <EOS> we can look for <EOS> we can look at upgrade <EOS> or we can look at um user-friendly . <EOS>
okay , <EOS> so we'll have a hundred percent profit then ? <EOS> twelve fifty . <EOS> i'm bad at math . <EOS> 'kay . um , <EOS> so now that , um , that is underway , um <EOS> okay . <EOS> it is discussion time . <EOS> so this is time for us to bring our initial ideas , any um suggestions that you may have so far , <EOS> a um your personal experiences with remote controls , and um , um , areas you see that , uh , could be improved in your experience with them . <EOS> does anyone have any initial thoughts ? <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i guess it would be <EOS> it's gotta be worth it to <EOS> i <EOS> 'cause i'm just mostly curious about like what kind of person or like company would would really find it useful , <EOS> 'cause can't really imagine , dunno . <EOS> how about a p a ? <EOS>
uh excuse me , bri <EOS> um , yeah . <EOS> oh , yeah . <EOS> so control f_ eight , right ? <EOS> yeah , mine seems to have turned off . <EOS> i can't do anything . <EOS> and i just touch the pad . <EOS> you just touch the pad , yeah . <EOS>
hmm . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> okay , <EOS> what does the interface look like ? <EOS> um well <EOS> push button , that's that's the one we're all familiar with . <EOS> um we can have scroll buttons <EOS> and the the scroll button can incorporate a push , <EOS> so you can have it like on a mouse <EOS> where you can use it to go up and down , change volume or channel or something like that <EOS> and push to select something . <EOS>
yeah is is <EOS> this is , from one channel to maybe to ten channel . <EOS> this is from one channel to <EOS> s but i di i didn't see where the t f the turn off t turn on turn off button so much activates <EOS> maybe one of the <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> mm mm mm mm mm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> these are kind of next generation functionalities . <EOS> it's the next generation thing , <EOS> but it is going to come in couple of years . <EOS> it's goi <EOS>
um i one thing i want to do is <EOS> oh , <EOS> i think the meeting's done . <EOS> i believe that is the end of our meeting . <EOS> thank you , melissa . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> um one thing i wa i wanna do is save everything in the right files , <EOS> because i don't think everything is saved . <EOS> the right files . final meeting market <EOS>
i think there there is there is al there there is a a technology like show view who is already available on most of the t_v_ set on recorders or thing like that <EOS> and we can try t to get this information on to the remote control to to do the processing on the remote control because <EOS>
that's <EOS> 'cause uh and i think of voice-activated <EOS> i think of of how many times i've i've lost my my remote and i can't find it . <EOS> so some way that i can i can find my remote by clapping my hands or something <EOS> uh and and so so um <EOS> but this 's just something . <EOS> i'm trying to find some bells and whistles <EOS> 'cause when they talk about tel taking out teletext , it's like , what are we gonna put in ? <EOS> what makes this thing attractive ? <EOS> and it's only for televisions . <EOS>
neither am i . <EOS> oh i see , <EOS> so we shouldn't really be <EOS> oh right okay , so . <EOS> so we have the project team , which is to um basically to come up with a new r remote control device . <EOS> uh we have uh the starting base was the original which has been in existence now for a period of time . <EOS> and uh our idea is to uh to make the new remote control device uh more user friendly than the previous one , <EOS> and to to be trendier , to be with it , <EOS> and therefore to uh to get a bigger market share and bigger audience . <EOS> so um <EOS> method of doing this is uh split up as you can see into uh the functional design , the conceptional design , and the detailed design . <EOS>
we're not talking <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah but y but you have to go through all the channels if you want to go <EOS> i think you can if you have a scale , so <EOS> no no , you don't have to y no <EOS> it's uh when you when you stop t uh <EOS> when you stop , the the turn , <EOS>
mm . <EOS> uh it makes it fairly unnecessary then . <EOS> okay . <EOS> um , okay so scratch that . <EOS> uh so we've got <EOS> do we want to go with the t_f_t_ idea or the is that far too expensive ? <EOS> well i mean i think i think the sort of find the finder things i mean it's uh i could probably write the circuit diagram for that myself . <EOS> um <EOS>
and project manager of course . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> was good teamwork . <EOS> i think we are well-suited to our roles . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> alright how were our means ? <EOS> um <EOS> we needed more play doh colours . <EOS>
it's sort of <EOS> couple of couple of grey stripes . <EOS> we could put the grey stripes on the bottom so that that person could turn it over . <EOS> it would look like a banana just sitting on their table . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> on the the gr <EOS> the rubbery grips could be grey . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , i think this is just the preliminary , <EOS> get some rough ideas for what our experiences with remote controls have been <EOS> and and what we would roughly what we would incorporate into a new one maybe . <EOS>
yeah yeah yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> i had another uh idea about maybe parental control . um , <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> like building in uh some kind of pin code <EOS> uh which allows uh parents to switch to all channels , uh <EOS> but children <EOS> uh if children don't don't know the pin code , they can't switch to uh violent uh channels or <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> how much will it cost for one hundred thousand ? <EOS> usually this is less tha at two dollars per chip . <EOS> okay . <EOS> because we are <EOS> so you have any idea for a powerful one that has uh good enough for do speech recognition . <EOS>
that slide was like that ? <EOS> hmm . <EOS> well . <EOS> um ch <EOS> i guess we're on the right track . <EOS> yeah well . <EOS> any new ideas with regard to remote control concepts ? <EOS> w i kinda like th <EOS> no , none . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> yes master . <EOS> so <EOS> do you need to add anything ? <EOS> no . <EOS> you feel okay ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> you feel uh free to express what you want to say ? <EOS> you don't feel too constrained ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
no , that would be your telephone in with your television . <EOS> yeah , the that wouldn't be the remote so much , <EOS> i mean <EOS> no i <EOS> yeah , <EOS> and i <EOS> no , but if you get bluetooth on the remote , you'd be able to <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> so . shall we <EOS> meeting adjourned . <EOS> right . <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
so <EOS> we're going to talk about the conceptual model . <EOS> oh . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> which one was mine ? <EOS> so <EOS> that's me . <EOS> uh okay . so uh okay . <EOS> okay , so <EOS> i just show you the m the no mm mm the the the the the the minutes , minute . <EOS> what's it called , <EOS> i dunno . <EOS> whatever . <EOS>
it's cer it's certainly possible i mean , <EOS> but they we we're going beyond w w <EOS> given the state of the technology we want something that we kno we know will will work um . <EOS> bu <EOS> mm . <EOS> hmm yeah . <EOS> well <EOS> you can still i incorporate the voice with with less buttons . <EOS> i mean uh <EOS> if the power button was also somehow like a menu button you could press that and or do voice commands , <EOS> and either volume thing could also be to scroll through other options like y and you could scroll through brightness <EOS> and and sc <EOS> and then you can you can minimise the buttons <EOS> and still have those , you know , brightness and tint and stuff . <EOS>
i i didn't read i read it , <EOS> so <EOS> it's not for me , <EOS> i didn't get it uh anyway . <EOS> it's only for you . <EOS> you didn't read it ? <EOS> no , i didn don't thing we got it . <EOS> yes . <EOS>
wha <EOS> at some times i sometimes i received like like five emails at at one moment , <EOS> and then <EOS> oh right , <EOS> it is there . <EOS> was searching and searching . <EOS> no , i i never got that . <EOS> i always <EOS> i got like one email after ten minutes or something . <EOS>
sure . <EOS> the noise for when you lose the banana , um f yeah , for when you lose the remote control , it could be like a a monkey noise or something like that , rather than a standard beep beep . <EOS> y you know , <EOS> you lose the monkey the banana , <EOS>
at least it's environmentally friendly . <EOS> so , this is our finding . <EOS> and a as she said , it's an environmentally friendly uh material , <EOS> so we're we're currently uh proposing , <EOS> uh we'll get to all my personal preferences in just a second . <EOS> so then there's this other matter of the chips and um well we could use a simple design on the board , <EOS> but uh these simple chips , but that's only works for the bu you don't get very much um intelligence with this simple one . <EOS> and um then there was the regular which <EOS> i regret that i've forgotten exactly why i'm eliminating that one . <EOS> uh the other option was this advanced chip on print , <EOS> and uh we liked th we <EOS> we found that it it includes this infrared sender , <EOS> which w 'member the beam was that was an important component of finding the right chip . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yes . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yes . <EOS> come on . <EOS> okay , one . <EOS> uh regular chip on print . no . <EOS> no . <EOS> that's all we need , the one <EOS> case , uncurved flat , single curved , double curved . <EOS>
i i know i dunno . is <EOS> yeah , it can . <EOS> 'cause this a mo mib uh mobile phone as well . <EOS> yeah , okay . <EOS> maybe it's it's more impor more expensive . <EOS> i think it's <EOS> maybe put some different ones in it . <EOS> doesn't matter . <EOS> it's just no , just some led . <EOS>
but <EOS> okay . <EOS> i'm seeing five then . <EOS> what do you guys think ? <EOS> i would say five or six . <EOS> david ? <EOS> okay . <EOS> yep i'm fine with that . <EOS> okay let's go with five then . <EOS> okay . <EOS> fi oh uh just actually the opposite . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> the <EOS> together indeed uh , <EOS> because you ma might have some some information on the the easy to use , <EOS> what you were already mentioning . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah yeah i agree . <EOS> it should be easier with that . <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> mm . <EOS> important issues about the remote . <EOS> i think it would be better with a personal reference , but okay . <EOS> remote control has to have to have a low power usage , <EOS> because s w seventy five percent of the users only zap one time an hour , <EOS> so the power usage is also one one time an hour , or so , <EOS> with a high power usage we would use a lot of but batteries . <EOS> the volume button and the channel buttons are the two most important buttons on the remote control , <EOS> so those they those have to h be find very easily . <EOS> and have to be somewhat like bigger etcetera . <EOS> it has also be have to find easily when the label is gone . <EOS> my colleague also announced it that labels should be scratched off <EOS> or would be s uh <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> something very basic . <EOS> right . <EOS> right . <EOS> therefore be found . <EOS> sounds good . <EOS> is that only gonna be within our two hundred foot range then ? <EOS> oh yeah i think that's very doable . <EOS> okay . <EOS> the difficulty wh would be in um i think like i you couldn't speak into the remote that you're trying to find . <EOS> 'kay <EOS> you have something that picks up <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> um maybe some other technology than infrared . <EOS> uh i rather find it very annoying um , like when someone is standing in front of the t_v_ then you can't switch it . <EOS> um think about um sending it over radio waves or bluetooth . <EOS>
but teletext is just one button . <EOS> yeah but then you have to you have to define the buttons to surf amongst pages and stuff . <EOS> you you just write the write the numbers . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so well <EOS> so will you add with the channel keys , right ? <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> because because meeting rooms to me are very important tools to do uh collaborative work . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> so i think we need a <EOS> but on the other hand we also have to relax , so that's <EOS> yeah , <EOS> and and i think also we need a separate discussion on the furnishing of the lounge , <EOS> which is a whole other topic . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yep . <EOS> um , one thing is interesting is talking about um speech recognition in a remote control . <EOS> speech recognition in <EOS> and who would pay more for that and whether people would find it useful . <EOS> d do you have numbers o o on that ? <EOS>
exactly but the uh but the upper side has to be a bit more like that i think . <EOS> no <EOS> so i just work here a few minutes . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah the display , <EOS> we yeah we can put a display . <EOS> uh don't you think ? <EOS> so the display we will put in here , the basic uh functions in here , where it's most reachable . <EOS> the <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> sorry ? <EOS> the first and the third point , they are clashing . <EOS> well it can still be a , you can still extend past the hand . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> so fitting the hand doesn't mean much then . <EOS>
gateway arrays . <EOS> it's a field programmable gateway arrays . <EOS> so why's it how is it different from the bluetooth ? <EOS> well , uh a f_p_g_a_ is just a chip you can uh you can pr programme it uh wi with wh whatever you want . <EOS> and uh well the bluetooth chip is just responsible to uh make the communication uh between uh the two devices . <EOS>
and then we now sh only have to t to decide the general function uh . <EOS> so um <EOS> let let's say next meeting w you produce two designs , one one yeah sure . <EOS> yeah <EOS> we will uh <EOS> one less advanced and one more advanced and with the cost price .
um oh , don't worry <EOS> it's all said , <EOS> i was just gonna say <EOS> uh yeah , <EOS> are we gonna make this as part of like like uh a part of the f like it it <EOS> the fashions apply to furniture , <EOS> so are we gonna make this part of the furniture ? <EOS>
consensus on the , what we're gonna do . <EOS> uh a little plan on on what we're going to do . <EOS> so you don't uh uh come up with the user requirements who don't fit the the the the technical functions at all . <EOS> some basic things we co we want to going to do . <EOS> uh i think that's well uh yeah . <EOS> will come in handy . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> well if it is going to be just a t_v_ remote control it is going to be very simple . <EOS> yeah okay . <EOS> so yeah the key point here is simple . <EOS> maybe . <EOS> so few buttons , channel , volume control <EOS> and what el what function do you see <EOS>
uh-huh . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> okay . <EOS> the the keyrings , yeah yeah . <EOS> okay , <EOS> that's cool . <EOS> because we always lose our remote control . <EOS> right . <EOS> and apart from this , it should be having a good look also , <EOS> because people really li uh like to play with it when they are watching movies or playing with or playing with their c_d_ player , m_p_ three player like any electronic devices . <EOS> they really want to have something good , having a good design in their hands , <EOS> so , yes , <EOS> all this . <EOS>
mm . um <EOS> i don't actually have any price information , <EOS> no . <EOS> and and do we know how long it'll take to uh develop a a custom chip . <EOS> um <EOS> it <EOS> a lot longer than an off the shelf chip . <EOS> oh w yeah , <EOS> we did the <EOS> the problem is the the the voice technology is not really highly developed , <EOS> it's sort of still still in an ex experimental form , <EOS> uh so it would uh <EOS> it's hard to predict the time . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> yes . <EOS> one and the l_c_ display . <EOS> okay <EOS> and then buttons , we have what , two colours ? <EOS> how many <EOS> um we have um got some push buttons as well . <EOS> or even clear . <EOS> we've got push buttons as well . <EOS>
i i noticed that . by accident . <EOS> interesting . <EOS> well huh . <EOS> an interesting day all in all i would say . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> it's uh <EOS> uh , yeah , i'd say so . <EOS> so <EOS> again i reiterate my question <EOS> of how different we are comp compared to the other groups , especially between culture groups and what not . <EOS>
that's funny . <EOS> oh . <EOS> you you're taking stuff from a bag <EOS> and putting them in the refrigerator <EOS> and then go back to my room . <EOS> can't get in . <EOS> can't get in , <EOS> look all around the kitchen . <EOS> definitely in the vegetable drawer . <EOS>
uh that i think that's the next next meeting . <EOS> okay . <EOS> but you definitely get a specific instruction . <EOS> okay , <EOS> so <EOS> now we're ka thirty minutes alone again ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> but th think about something that's more rounded . <EOS> just and more <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah but we we should be careful about the battery life , then . if we use the speech recognition . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> and uh yeah , now the meeting room is busy . <EOS> somebody booked the meeting room just for at one p_m_ , <EOS> and so we should leave . <EOS> uh . <EOS> so , um . so now we are going for for a small lunch . <EOS> it's uh funded by the company . <EOS> and uh after we have uh thirteen minutes to to do indevel individual works . <EOS> and uh i will do the minutes . <EOS> and uh you are going to work on your individual works . <EOS> and uh you will receive as usual your specific instruction and so on . <EOS> thank you everybody . <EOS>
um i was sent some information from the company saying that they , the technology department have devised a new speech recognition technology , where you can program questions into such devices . <EOS> they gave an example of a coffee machine where you program a question , you program the answer , and the machine responds accordingly . <EOS>
right . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> uh the fi <EOS> yeah , <EOS> the finder function rather than as a speech function to find your remote . <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so you also said for going for the international market um that some some maybe older people might not like the speech recognition . <EOS>
and you keep losing them . <EOS> you keep losing them . <EOS> okay . <EOS> mm . <EOS> finding them is really a pain , you know . <EOS> i mean it's usually quite small , <EOS> or when you want it right , it slipped behind the couch <EOS> or it's kicked under the table . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> mm . <EOS> we int <EOS> it's interesting , maybe we can create a a line of uh t_v_ with uh a a tr <EOS> yeah , t_v_ , yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> a t_v_ for autumn and a t_v_ for winter , you know , so it's <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> now <EOS> when you were um creating your um prototypes here , did you work together or did you like do separate projects ? <EOS> uh we we worked together , <EOS> um but we were making <EOS> like <EOS> we sort of made different shapes <EOS> and then discussed how the how the buttons might work , <EOS> um and how we could like improve on the on the design . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> my name's poppy . <EOS> i'm the industrial designer for this project . <EOS> um , i'm going to be responsible for the functional design phase . <EOS> also the conceptual design and the detailed design for the final product . <EOS> nice to meet you poppy . <EOS>
that's definitely our uh <EOS> oh nee , oh <EOS> seven is it ? <EOS> it is . <EOS> yeah , uh <EOS> the remote score . <EOS> no ? <EOS> oh yeah . <EOS> a false , yeah . <EOS> yeah . yeah , <EOS> but i think you should make it one scale with with one being good and seven being bad , <EOS> because otherwise we can't uh calculate anything from the results , <EOS> so <EOS>
hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> well <EOS> that <EOS> on the ipod , for example , you just every time you wanna go back you hit the menu button again <EOS> and it brings you back one level . <EOS> but that has a menu button separate from a select button , <EOS> whereas if this one's both the menu and the select button ? <EOS>
so it might literally just be <EOS> okay . <EOS> two curves . <EOS> yeah <EOS> like that . <EOS> whereas this is two curves . um <EOS> so i guess that's what they mean by uh double curve . <EOS> um which obviously <EOS> it looks better than the single curve , <EOS> but uh you can't have it in titanium , <EOS> which is <EOS>
so has to be yellow . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> as we say , we put the fashion in electronics , <EOS> so it has to be a fashion remote control . fancy , fashion , powerful , easy to use . <EOS> yellow . okay . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS>
they only cost pennies . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> y i'm i'm not sure about the banana idea . <EOS> huh ? <EOS> um . <EOS> so a spongy banana re <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i mean that that th <EOS> rubber banana . <EOS> okay . <EOS> does <EOS> it does seem a bit uh again childish maybe . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> that's right . <EOS> well no didn't we say we wanted to do a rubber <EOS> no , <EOS> it's too <EOS> no . <EOS> too expensive . <EOS> if you drop it ? <EOS> it's too expensive . <EOS> well when <EOS> okay . <EOS> well we we'll come back we'll come back and see if we can fit it in . <EOS>
okay , <EOS> so use uh very uh lot of peo <EOS> perhaps you can uh make adjustable fronts , like with the telephones . <EOS> you can uh but i don't think that uh <EOS> adjust with phones , yes <EOS> okay . <EOS> twelve euro fifty . <EOS> well , <EOS> make it available in different colours , you mean ? <EOS> sure . <EOS>
is it a white rabbit f <EOS> it's the white rabbit from the matrix . <EOS> yeah , exactly . <EOS> okay , then yeah . <EOS> there , the g white green rabbit . <EOS> so . <EOS> he's a little bit stoned there . <EOS> uh i figured this is a pretty b good impression of a rabbit . <EOS>
right . so get this . <EOS> okay so now i need to press f_ eight , what is it ? <EOS> uh function f_ eight . <EOS> function f_ eight . <EOS> 'kay . <EOS> what's function ? <EOS> it's the little blue w it's the one th <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
but you're our marketing expert . <EOS> i think they're about ten po ten pound , <EOS> aren't they ? <EOS> about ten pounds . <EOS> fifteen ? <EOS> but you don't have to buy batteries . <EOS> so in the long term this can actually save you money . <EOS> so we'll market it that way too . <EOS>
but it's exactly th <EOS> in uh on most on most remote controls . <EOS> so so if we use that , they will probably have a long learning uh time . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> i think <EOS> i dunno . <EOS> i <EOS> you already have the volume on the side , <EOS> so you can't make it you can't ma make a mistake . <EOS> so it's uh <EOS>
great . <EOS> okay . <EOS> so anyway it's just just an idea . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i'm thinking maybe we could incorporate some of these features into a fairly um into something which is which seems to have something to it which is almost gimmicky <EOS> because like um like something to do with like lighting within it . <EOS> like you know just within the simple sense , when you pick up a phone and touch a button it uh lights up , q usually the buttons light up . <EOS> how can we build on that ? <EOS> maybe like it could light up in different colours or something <EOS> or or people could buy the buy the control and then it comes with different like <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i had to admit , as soon as w we started i mean as soon as we got the play-doh , th you know the whole concept of really trying to stick with reality went out the window . <EOS> i could only imagine . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> and use . i had no real specific ideas for this , <EOS> maybe we just , the basic idea of having your core functions big and at the top maybe , by themselves , <EOS> and then <EOS> yeah <EOS> and then th th the finer details of buttons you don't use as much either hidden away or completely separate . <EOS>
now to the second . <EOS> 'kay . <EOS> uh okay . um <EOS> i've been looking at uh the user interface of it . um f for the techno f functions uh of of it . um <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah <EOS> you can take your time . <EOS> we've got uh plenty of time , <EOS> so <EOS>
the functionality in the future . <EOS> alright . <EOS> . <EOS> in future . <EOS> yeah . because all the t_v_ sets will be digital , right . <EOS> all the programmes , everything will be in digital than analog . <EOS> th the system will change and we have to anticipate for those change . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> it may need more actually , <EOS> so y you you may need to check your battery usage <EOS> it <EOS> and then you need that , some functionality to indicate the battery limit . <EOS> and then if the battery limit is indicated , if it could be ind indicated through a blinking something <EOS> and it can change the colour depending on your uh how much is the battery , <EOS> well <EOS> that is good enough to even locate even if you want to . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> but at the same time i think maybe we can we can just decide to to have both of these groups as our target , <EOS> because actually i mean they're all still re young people . <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
i think in middle . <EOS> still on the bottom <EOS> or <EOS> uh wh what is the middle part ? <EOS> that's the numbers . <EOS> uh i think th the numbers should be in the bottom , and and the switch channel in the middle . <EOS> numbers , okay . <EOS> yeah , i agree as well . <EOS> use the dz <EOS>
alright . <EOS> we need <EOS> we need to have um um remote control which is fanc fancy , <EOS> which is uh which is easy to to hand not too small , not too big . <EOS> um we have <EOS> or good shape , yes . <EOS> we should bring new technologies for young peoples , <EOS> and uh as we have uh also requirements to to use uh to to push thr toward the internet . <EOS> maybe this is something we can stick to it . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> okay . <EOS> sure . <EOS> so um <EOS> are we done with this meeting ? <EOS> yeah , i hope , <EOS> if <EOS> is it okay if uh they will come up with the prototype design , okay . <EOS> then they can show you how it looks like , <EOS> and then we can uh submit to the <EOS> i will submit to the management . <EOS> okay ? <EOS> then meantime you can come up with the price , how much it's cost as extra for uh the display . <EOS> an and the marketing strategy , that's very important , okay . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> but basically these are curved and double-curved <EOS> i i believe that the tech department , in their um in their message to me , that they were referring to the number of th curves in the bottom . <EOS> i have no idea exactly what they're talking about , <EOS> but that's what they told me , uncurved , flat , curved , or double-curved . <EOS>
yes , i will . yes . <EOS> mm-hmm , <EOS> yeah , that would be useful . <EOS> i'll copy , uh <EOS> le let us keep all the emails and all the copies , okay , share each other , okay , so you know everybody what's happening , okay ? <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> and s if we spend that time and effort on features that we're not gonna use , maybe it's better to spend it on the f thinking more about features that we actually do want , <EOS> but <EOS> oh <EOS> th we s we still have <EOS>
yeah , <EOS> but i think the wireless problem is more the um david jordan's problem . <EOS> as it's <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> the wire ? <EOS> yeah . true . <EOS> okay , yeah . <EOS> i think it's more your problem . <EOS> mayb maybe you have just to to kind of research <EOS> or try to ask people if they will like something wireless or not . <EOS>
where did you go to uni nathan ? <EOS> oh <EOS> brilliant . cool . <EOS> my little brother goes there . <EOS> right so <EOS> desert island discs . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> u_c_l_a_ . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> so . <EOS> so <EOS> do we have to wait for you to write it down <EOS> or are you gonna tell us ? <EOS> i'm waiting to know . <EOS>
yeah okay , but yeah , well <EOS> w <EOS> i think the buttons are very easy . <EOS> with just uh standard buttons we just have so little <EOS> o <EOS> but maybe you can put um the g the options of teletext on the second level of the remote control . <EOS> because you ne almost never use it . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> um um wi on on a what ? <EOS> oh project project documents , yeah , yeah , yeah , okay . <EOS> project documents , yeah . <EOS> so i'll put it in there . <EOS> is it best if i send you an email maybe , to let you know it's there ? <EOS>
yeah , . <EOS> savings . <EOS> mm-mm , <EOS> um , nor would changing the case materials . <EOS> mm-mm . <EOS> um . so yeah <EOS> that looks like to be the only thing . <EOS> so that would be the <EOS> it's a major change but <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
and it's got just few buttons , quite low looking , and all this stuff we already we already discussed . <EOS> do you think it can come in several colours ? or did the <EOS> i would make a backlight of the l_c_d_ screen with different colours . <EOS> um but not the case . <EOS>
it looks like you're already on your way for uh working with the components . <EOS> um chips , the what chips we need <EOS> and what uh <EOS> . <EOS> you know <EOS> how to power it and whatnot . <EOS> user interface concept , we want it to be something simple . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> you have if you press them for a long time <EOS> no . doesn't work <EOS> does it . <EOS> maybe we should have also a digit button <EOS> maybe we should have a complete keyboard and just type console commands . <EOS> change channel to eight . <EOS>
yes . <EOS> um we've evaluated the project . <EOS> yes . <EOS> you've got the scores . <EOS> can you put that in the project documents file ? <EOS> it's in there already . <EOS> and the process wheel didn't really have any major problems with . <EOS> were there any was there anything that you found difficult , <EOS>
i believe so , yeah . <EOS> that would probably not be in keeping with the um the fashion statement and such , <EOS> yeah . <EOS> technology . yeah . <EOS> fashion . <EOS> okay . <EOS> so basically <EOS> the only new thing is the l_c_d_ on the remote now . <EOS>
but there is one problem then the user has to understand each of that functionality . <EOS> because the same button is doing too many things . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah well we w <EOS> yeah <EOS> well we will have a bit of a simpler uh task in that we're only doing uh a television remote control . <EOS> um i think maybe one option is to have you know a little flip-open um door that uh that you have hidden most of the time , but contains the extra buttons like , say , the number buttons for instance . um <EOS>
oh okay . i see . <EOS> yeah also like this . so you can hold it . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> but it has also to <EOS> it it has also to be uh luxurous uh for for yeah rich people . <EOS> th this looks a little bit like like for only for children . so <EOS>
do you require different types of p_c_b_s and <EOS> mm . <EOS> or uh it could be like this the p_c_b_ would be the same for all , but only the exterior uh shape is different o for all . <EOS> mm . <EOS> uh well but it's a bit complicated to if if if you need machines to different machines to um ah well <EOS>
do you do you need to double click on that to open it ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> there we are . <EOS> yes . <EOS> that's the only excel document that will be in there , <EOS> so it's there for all of us . <EOS> okay , so , <EOS> are they under twelve fifty ? <EOS> yes , <EOS> go to the project evaluation , next slide . <EOS> right . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> no we're not <EOS> we don't need anything special for the buttons . <EOS> okay so we are over budget . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so first thing which we should take care of is , <EOS> make it plastic instead of rubber . <EOS> and then we're basically o on budget except for you know ten cents . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> well , <EOS> what i can uh suggest to you , christine , <EOS> okay , <EOS> uh if you need some uh the technical feedback , or some training , okay , about uh this facility , especially for the speech recognition , i can recommend you some companies like uh intel or i_b_m_ , <EOS> okay , <EOS> because they're already in this uh speech recognition part , <EOS> okay . <EOS> and uh you can maybe have some uh technical backup from them , some kind of a technical tie-up . <EOS> okay , <EOS> and uh if you want , i can coordinate , okay , to get some information , <EOS> okay , <EOS> and uh you can uh let me know , okay , so what kind of uh the details you require okay , to add this feature in this project . <EOS> i don't think it's uh the difficult . <EOS> and uh <EOS> we need to know how much is the timeframe you need to develop , apart from uh what today . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> thank you . <EOS> okay . <EOS> thank you . <EOS>
really ? <EOS> mm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> or a yeah an advert an advert for b_b_c_ two on b_b_c_ one'll switch the channel for you kinda thing . <EOS> right , right , <EOS> and so there was a lot of this , you'd be watching the t_v_ and then all of a sudden it'd it'd pick up a noise and turn it off or you know or turn the volume off or something , <EOS> but if you can work around that that noise problem <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm . um <EOS> yeah . <EOS> like y you wouldn't hear the speaker . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> just before we go through all of the steps here , um well what we'll do is <EOS> you wanna say something ? <EOS> um if we can look at the criteria you're gonna evaluate , <EOS> and then we'll come back to the product evaluation <EOS> if that's alright . <EOS> yeah , is that <EOS>
uh i kno <EOS> yeah ? <EOS> okay . <EOS> oh , <EOS> i have a modern one . <EOS> and the modern one you you uh you type uh search , <EOS> and the led began to blink blink blink . <EOS> and uh uh uh after uh a short time the television turns off . <EOS> and then you know , oh it it's the right one . <EOS> and you can stop it , <EOS> and then it's okay . <EOS>
it's a cat ? <EOS> i thought these things did not exist . <EOS> yes yes <EOS> is it like that . <EOS> is it better ? <EOS> okay . <EOS> it's my cat . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> the name is caramel . <EOS> me <EOS> ah yeah . yeah . <EOS>
like an s_ shape . <EOS> okay . <EOS> like this , one curve on this side , one curve on that side . <EOS> hmm . hmm . <EOS> i don't think that counts as a curve , i think that's just a shape . <EOS> okay . <EOS> a curvature is like the this case . <EOS>
i think b but the the vocal command is easy too . <EOS> you can say fifty and fifty it's okay , so <EOS> yeah voc vocal command is okay . <EOS> but w we've said previously that maybe it's not going to be th l the main <EOS> there's uh also a number , you know . <EOS>
well <EOS> it is useful , <EOS> but it doesn't really work all the time . <EOS> th the pen doesn't <EOS> yeah , it is useful , but <EOS> no . <EOS> because when you put this pen on the screen uh uh for exam and line is d being drawn at at two or three centimetres uh below . <EOS>
yeah , t probably . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay . um oh , <EOS> there're a couple functions do we want something so that do we want some kind of thing to find it if it's lost ? <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> like a button on a t_v_ you can press <EOS> and it'll ring or something , <EOS> i don't know <EOS> like <EOS> or beep ? <EOS>
okay , so what uh number do we give uh a beautiful ? <EOS> beautiful is uh really subjective , uh because it has to do lots with the colours . <EOS> well we have changeable fronts , so <EOS> changeable fronts , so ev for everyone for everyone it's something beautiful . <EOS>
so maybe we could have like <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> contradicting kind of shapes . yeah i i know what you mean . <EOS> so maybe we could have volume written on the side <EOS> and then up and down on the on the buttons themselves . <EOS>
i was still uh i was still working on this uh twenty five euro price point <EOS> because i think actually having looked at some of the remotes out there , this is quite a low uh price <EOS> if if we're <EOS> maybe i can get to this in my presentation though , <EOS> but um yeah . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . that would be cool . but eight months is really long <EOS> and <EOS> yeah . <EOS> maybe we can just uh <EOS> ten years <EOS> okay . <EOS> so um i i will uh i will <EOS> so i we will move to next meeting so in after the lunch break <EOS> uh here are the individual uh action uh you are required to do <EOS> but you will be uh recalled to the actions by uh email i think <EOS> but you can take notes if you if you want but well the instruction will be sent . <EOS> so <EOS>
yeah , three point five . <EOS> who is the outlier ? <EOS> wh wh you said five ? <EOS> no no you say five , he is the outlier . <EOS> no i said five . <EOS> okay just just do a sum . <EOS> i don't know if it's a <EOS>
maybe maybe i should uh start . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so maybe we could start with the market , yeah . <EOS> mm . okay . <EOS> okay so i have your slides somewhere ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> should be in participant four . <EOS> participant four . <EOS> this one ? <EOS>
so th this is a d next generation controller . yeah . <EOS> sure . <EOS> yeah , you would never you would never lose this one , yeah . <EOS> yeah maybe , maybe may <EOS> it's the next prototype , maybe we cou <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay okay , okay . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> i thi you us <EOS> yeah yeah . <EOS> it'll be in a different window , yep . <EOS> that's <EOS> left <EOS> that one . <EOS> yep . <EOS> okay perfect . .. . <EOS> mm . so <EOS> that's the figure that i was just talking about there , with the different demographics . <EOS> another thing it's talking about there is the l_c_d_ screen <EOS> but there's no figures apparently on that . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> so . <EOS> thank you <EOS> i think that's all for this point . <EOS> good . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> thank you <EOS> uh , so we come back in five minutes ? <EOS> half an hour . <EOS> anyway you will receive some messages . <EOS> be careful . <EOS> you eat it ? <EOS> does it move uh ? <EOS> okay , but i don't know if it uh is still correctly uh <EOS> we'll see . <EOS>
okay . yeah . <EOS> but uh we also have to stand out , <EOS> 'cause there are already , like you said , so many controls out that support lot of stuff . <EOS> but we have to make sure that we're better usability , <EOS> and stand out by just looks of it . <EOS> so make it just a different colour or different shape , <EOS> so <EOS>
oh dear , . <EOS> sure . <EOS> inspired by . <EOS> well <EOS> this this what we're gonna t this is their motto , like . <EOS> and we're we're not doing well on it . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> this is their strategy . <EOS> i m imagine we actually had some money invested in this <EOS> and the amount that we invest is gonna be proportional to the marks . <EOS> might we might wanna be a bit more skepible sceptical about this one . <EOS>
i mean that what you are sayin that's what the design <EOS> no it's like this , <EOS> i mean on the l_c_d_ , according to what i understand from your model is , you have a joystick here , and you have l_c_d_ , you just press your joystick , you get here a programme . <EOS> uh then <EOS>
yeah , <EOS> no , no . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> 'kay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> i mean you can you could do it , <EOS> you could have a <EOS> 'cause if you if you just put the full charge through an l_c_d_ display it'll completely blank it out , <EOS> but i don't know if you could get any mirror effect on it , <EOS> i'm not sure about <EOS>
we have pushbuttons , <EOS> mm . <EOS> scro we have scroll wheel as well . <EOS> scroll wheel with pushbutton we had , no ? <EOS> s yeah , yeah , <EOS> we had , for muting , yeah . <EOS> and we have l_c_ display <EOS> and yeah . <EOS>
okay , we'll talk about that <EOS> so if you finish your <EOS> and we'll come back to that . <EOS> that's you , right okay . <EOS> yeah that's <EOS> yeah that that's the end of m my <EOS> and just one small question before like you are , <EOS> regarding the circuit , since we are hav having a flip-top , we can customise the two circuits for different type of buttons <EOS> like we are keeping the standard buttons on the top and the more complex buttons under this thing , so we can divide the circuit like you know . <EOS>
so sh completely changed our demographic there , <EOS> it's not part of the the funky young thing . <EOS> and <EOS> well <EOS> exce except for the surfing shape . i mean that's that's something which which has an appeal on this group i think , <EOS> but <EOS> yeah that's true . <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
that's not a scroll wheel . <EOS> nah . <EOS> oh okay okay . i see . <EOS> right . <EOS> instead of play , stop , rewind , and fast forward there , that's up , down , louder , and quieter . <EOS> uh , okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS>
so one and a half . <EOS> yeah , one . <EOS> half . <EOS> so we can say two or one <EOS> okay . <EOS> so th seven seven . <EOS> a two . <EOS> uh overall we are getting two something , <EOS> but we can round it as two . <EOS>
oh yeah sure . <EOS> you have playstation also ? <EOS> it's a <EOS> yeah . <EOS> ah . uh <EOS> where was it ? in settings ? <EOS> huh . <EOS> okay . alright . <EOS> thank you . <EOS> do you guys like your tasks ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
yeah , yeah . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> 'cause if <EOS> yeah , <EOS> in that kinda position the fingers would be better for pressing and the that for rolling , <EOS> just the way it would <EOS> fingers , <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i mean it's it's it <EOS> yeah , i mean <EOS> it it it seems to me that uh it uh it al also has the advantage that it it the two are clearly different , <EOS> um that there's no no possibility of uh confusing the two . <EOS> so okay . right so uh <EOS> that's <EOS> sorry <EOS> is that that all you want to say at the mo <EOS> okay , fine . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> and uh and of course the channel changing buttons . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i i talk about that , yeah ? <EOS> how should they how should we implement that ? <EOS> because uh could be numerical only or could be also incremental . <EOS>
give it a one . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i wonder if it bounces when you drop it . <EOS> ooh , <EOS> that you couldn't <EOS> it'd be harder to break , <EOS> harder to lose . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> 'cause there would be less impact maybe , . <EOS>
are you sure i got it all <EOS> head's kinda small . <EOS> okay . <EOS> how're we placed in terms of the <EOS> alright . <EOS> we're okay ? <EOS> guess i should probably try to sit up straight . <EOS> like that ? <EOS> okay , cool . <EOS>
right . <EOS> right . <EOS> so that's a problem regardless of of any design modifications you you come up with , <EOS> that's gonna be a problem anyway with the older generation perhaps , <EOS> and that's another issue how we tackle that . yeah . mm , yeah , the age gap . <EOS>
well , i think it is . <EOS> well y just uh f <EOS> but the rest of it is very easy , <EOS> because there are so so n <EOS> yeah , i think it's very clear what it all does . <EOS> so so few information that you can easily decide what buttons w for what function . <EOS>
or my d <EOS> what about um the idea that i had with the cradle ? <EOS> how do you feel about that ? <EOS> or how does everybody feel ? <EOS> well how does everybody feel ? <EOS> i i think <EOS> i mean i i well we g we're talking about the other end now . <EOS> i like it . <EOS> i like the idea , <EOS> but we have t we have to find out <EOS>
oh <EOS> that's that's fine then . <EOS> okay . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> w <EOS> yes , <EOS> we uh we can have lunch now . <EOS> so um <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah so <EOS> we meet in well what are our <EOS> then th th the next meeting will uh <EOS> after lunch you have uh we have uh thirty minutes of work <EOS> and then we have the next meeting . <EOS> but you will be informed via the computer . <EOS> okay . <EOS>
well you were just talking about you've got to be careful how you shape your buttons , <EOS> 'cause you're can mis-direct people . <EOS> and i would've thought the functionality 'cause the people get cheesed off by things by having to read instructions et cetera , so . <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> traditional one ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so this one and this one . what do you choose ? <EOS> what do you choose ? <EOS> i prefer the laser remote control . no . <EOS> i think i would choose this one because of the colour . it's <EOS>
we can have a duck tape casing . <EOS> we could . <EOS> i think that goes against the whole fancy something , a new line , <EOS> but worth a shot . <EOS> it could go with the granola crowd . <EOS> ah , <EOS> it could be , it could be , <EOS> um .
yeah you have uh <EOS> thirty minutes . <EOS> thirty minutes . <EOS> okay . <EOS> then we have to uh see something which we can uh <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> ah so this is basically the what what we are thinking about ? <EOS> alright . <EOS>
thirty-five percent say they're too difficult to use . <EOS> so we have to figure out a way of making it um more user friendly . <EOS> uh fifty percent say they can't find the remote half the time . <EOS> so maybe one word speech recognition commands , <EOS> say remote , and there's a beep beep beep , <EOS> and they can find it through , you know , ten tons of newspapers , magazines , whatever you have at home . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> so you can put a recharger in it as well . <EOS> but this is expensive , the sample speaker . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> this ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , it's four . <EOS> four . it's four euros . <EOS> oh , them . <EOS> is that uh included ? in the twelve euro or <EOS> okay , then we then we need to use it . <EOS>
no no no no no . <EOS> just looking . <EOS> no . <EOS> and they should be long lasting , not uh not be empty uh in about uh two minutes or uh thirty minutes or forty minutes of use . <EOS> and next step is the chip <EOS> uh th the component that's uh makes or transmits the signal to the television . <EOS> uh there was an option to use s a rather simple chip <EOS> but i think uh because uh of our uh highly uh requiring uh requirements , there should be an advanced chip in it <EOS> with uh also the ability to uh facilitate speaker speech recognition <EOS> uh which unfortunately is still in a test phase , <EOS> so uh <EOS> there should be some more uh investigation on that side . <EOS>
so is the two piece idea out ? <EOS> or have we not decided ? <EOS> well we sort of rid of that because gonna use a battery . <EOS> and the base station might not be necessary . <EOS> oh right okay . <EOS> well we can still design a two-piece uh remote um without having a base , having one of them be a base station , <EOS> but just have it be an optional either big remote with lots of functions , or you take out the smaller piece . <EOS> we can still do that . <EOS>
but is it <EOS> uh can you just buy it on the market and f plug it in <EOS> or you want to ma <EOS> no no no no <EOS> we we will uh <EOS> this is a preference <EOS> but we can always change uh <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> what i w what i was thinking about uh the the the schema uh about uh the sender and the receiver , <EOS> i mean <EOS> can you can you get back to it ? <EOS>
mm 'kay . <EOS> would <EOS> yeah , <EOS> but we don't want it to look like a kids' toy . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> now <EOS> that was one thing that we brought up over email . <EOS> i don't know if you picked up your email , <EOS> but um the f the um feature that we considered for it not getting lost . <EOS>
right . <EOS> so we've simplified , we don't need all those um play , fast-forward , rewind , <EOS> right , yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> or no menu buttons . <EOS> so we've pretty much pared it down to on-off , volume , mute , channel up and down , um the numbers <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
something that big and that yellow you just don't lose anymore . <EOS> yeah . it's bright yellow . <EOS> bright yellow's hard to lose . <EOS> but um if we were to , if we were , that , the speech recognition . that , we could maybe just use that solely for the the finding thing . <EOS> that was what we'd we'd mentioned . <EOS>
but <EOS> yeah <EOS> it uh <EOS> marketing . <EOS> yeah because if the product will be international <EOS> well that's the thing . <EOS> we need to know who we're selling it to before we can really decide on a <EOS> yeah okay , <EOS> so let's stick f to man mando for the name <EOS> and we'll see for the for the look and feel later . <EOS> so let's go for the three presentations right now . <EOS> so , who want to start ? <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> is that an option , a plastic shell with a rubbery coating on at certain spots ? <EOS> s certainly can be done yes . <EOS> um yeah . <EOS> if that doesn't affect the functional side of it all . <EOS> like say just the underside or so then it can be done . <EOS> i assume . <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
yeah , but uh <EOS> i don't think the the colours black and yellow go well together . <EOS> but <EOS> no , okay . <EOS> that's a that's a sen <EOS> we make i <EOS> maybe you can put yellow on the side and black on the on the front . <EOS>
'kay . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> n okay . <EOS> mm . <EOS> mm the shell ? <EOS> yeah . basically yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> and we have participant three , which i believe is pedro . <EOS> i <EOS> i can give you that to click on . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> play , pause . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> from d_v_d_ player to television or something . <EOS> yeah . i really can change it , <EOS> so <EOS> exactly yeah . to audio and to video on demand . <EOS> yes . <EOS> mm . <EOS>
uh it fell off . <EOS> one , two , three , four , <EOS> yeah , we're ready . <EOS> okay . <EOS> welcome to this second meeting . <EOS> um it's now quarter after twelve <EOS> and we're given forty minutes um for this meeting . <EOS> this is a meeting on functional design . <EOS> um and i wanna welcome you all <EOS> and thank you all for doing some research in between . <EOS> um i did took the minutes from the first meeting <EOS> and i'll show them to you in a moment . <EOS> um i know each of you have a presentation <EOS> and um in thinking about the forty minutes , i thought it would take only like three minutes for the previous minutes , <EOS> um each of you having about seven minutes or maybe a little more , maybe a little less for your pre presentations and a little discussion , <EOS> because there's i happen to have been told there were some new project requirements <EOS> and we have to make some uh decision on what functions it will have . <EOS> okay ? <EOS> is this ap <EOS> everybody agree with this ? <EOS>
mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> we can have a sp like a spongy skin on it <EOS> and then we can just whip that off and <EOS> yeah , <EOS> yeah . <EOS> uh . <EOS> yeah <EOS> like the kind you get on like hand weights . you know , that kind of spongy <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> mm . <EOS> the chip , we're going for an advanced chip on print . <EOS> we also said the sample sensor and sample speaker . <EOS> advanced , yeah . <EOS> yep . <EOS> um single-curved surface , so that we can fold it . <EOS> yeah , yes . <EOS>
it's okay . <EOS> uh so the general findings from that was uh in the market trends the most important aspect for remote controls were people want a fancy look and feel , rather than the the current functional look and feel of remote controls . <EOS> they also also want a remote control to be technologically innovative , <EOS> and of course , as we predicted , that it should be easy to use . <EOS> now i should point out that the first of those findings , fancy look and feel , is the most important , <EOS> is twice as important as the second , technologically innovative , <EOS> which is in turn twice as important as being easy to use . <EOS> so possibly that the feature that we put first is actually third <EOS> is still important , but it's third in order of preference for the the subject group we looked at . <EOS> okay , um , <EOS> now the fashion update which relates to very personal preferences among our subject group , <EOS> um we found from our um consultants in paris and milan who des attended all the design and fashion fairs there , that fruit and vegetables are going to be the theme for clothes , shoes and furniture . <EOS> so should we be thinking of using something like that in our remote control design too ? <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> oh yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> excel sheet , so <EOS> so it has the energy source . <EOS> we have hand dynamo . <EOS> no , we don't use that . <EOS> we have battery , right ? <EOS> kinetic , we don't have it , i suppose , <EOS> but we have solar cells . <EOS> um , how many do y do you need , solar cells ? <EOS> do you think one would be enough , or such as <EOS>
okay well , <EOS> so , it seems the the first thing that they've kinda specified is the price like based on how much profit we wanna make , <EOS> which seems to a kind of a little strange if we don't know what the the product is yet , <EOS> but i guess if that's if that's the requirement that we need to to design the the product to actually fit that that price bracket <EOS> so , i guess we're gonna need to find out what's actually you know , what people ar are willing to pay for <EOS> um what kind of product they're expecting for twenty-five euro <EOS> because it seems quite a lot for a remote control , <EOS> so it's <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> uh personally i wi uh i think that in terms of trends , these products are quite good , <EOS> like , these products are in fruit shape , <EOS> because that wha people now <EOS> our fashion trend shows that people like everything all f everything that is being advertised , like clothes , shoes , and everything is being advertised in the form of fruits and vegetables , or getting them or showing some association with them . <EOS>
oh , <EOS> i already erased half of the line . <EOS> bon chance <EOS> and move back to here . <EOS> too bad , oh . <EOS> like this ? mm-hmm . <EOS> still looks nice . and then all green . <EOS> okay , well <EOS> thank you . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> we wer we were thinking television . uh . <EOS> mm . <EOS> we are targ targeting the television set . <EOS> so , <EOS> you need to record the channels . <EOS> you need to browse the browse the channels in upward downward way , <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> what ? <EOS> uh <EOS> f like it's in if if fashion <EOS> if we're going for the it looks fancy , then fashion is obviously the line we gotta be going through . <EOS> but fashions do don't last very long . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> well <EOS> that can kinda tie into our changing uh face things , <EOS> like we could have the fruit and vegetable theme this year <EOS> and uh whatever happens next year , we can have the face plates , <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
yes . evalua evaluation <EOS> and also the evaluation criteria , so what what is important to look at . <EOS> okay . <EOS> basically this is what we've talked about already , um , from the marketing point of view . <EOS> we just wanna make sure that we've taken into account <EOS> yep . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> well , but i since it's made of rubber anyway . i i think it's it's uh <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> it l does look like the curvy <EOS> and then the whole shape's curvy , <EOS> so i would say that this curvy does look quite like a vegetable . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> the question is when you're rolling it , how do you wanna roll it ? <EOS> do you want 'em to roll it like that ? <EOS> do you want 'em to roll it like that ? <EOS> 'cause in a mouse your hand's in a position to roll it , <EOS> whereas the other thing about having it jog dial this way , it tends to get moved accidentally . <EOS>
hmm . nice . <EOS> but <EOS> mm , yeah . <EOS> mando sounds latino . <EOS> the mando . <EOS> okay . <EOS> so , let's go for mando ? <EOS> yeah ? no objection ? <EOS> yeah , yeah . <EOS> yeah that's . <EOS> and we could have some like you d <EOS> you could have the fonts you know special , <EOS> so you have man in like in in uh in one o in one font and then the o_ as like <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> 'kay . <EOS> like like a hand <EOS> like one of those portable phones kind of thing . <EOS> yeah that kind of thing . <EOS> yeah , that's yeah , exactly . <EOS> okay . <EOS> so uh a rechargeable battery . <EOS> okay . <EOS> um the user interface , the buttons , i guess we talked about this already . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> i think that the speech recognition technology would be cheaper the than the l_c_d_ . <EOS> it's it's cheaper as compared to the l_c_d_ . <EOS> yeah , but not sure . <EOS> maybe it's cheaper , <EOS> but we have no <EOS> because with the l_c_d_ you need more requirements . <EOS> you need a internet connection . <EOS> you need m more things . <EOS> but <EOS>
uh from <EOS> yeah yeah . <EOS> sorry . <EOS> from the <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah ? <EOS> yeah i'm i'm <EOS> the the idea is that it has to flip up to here . <EOS> may maybe it's it's easier to to integrate the the the l_c_d_ screen just into this this bubble . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i dunno . <EOS> i think we have only uh five minutes left . <EOS> participant four ? <EOS> functional requirements ? <EOS> okay . <EOS> uh no , <EOS> trend watching . <EOS> the other one . <EOS> this one ? <EOS> yeah . uh , i think so , <EOS> just <EOS> yeah , so <EOS> just to meet the user requirements i would just do a s short anal analysis of the remote control market <EOS> and to kind of um have a better overview of what's the fashion in general i've checked more than only the remote control market , <EOS> so <EOS> next . <EOS>
well what are we actually doing ? <EOS> what were <EOS> right . <EOS> i was just gonna step on to um <EOS> i wasn't ? <EOS> oh , <EOS> my bad <EOS> um sorry . <EOS> the <EOS> um , yeah okay <EOS> i was just gonna assign tasks in the next <EOS> b anyth any oth <EOS> any other final thoughts before we go ahead and <EOS> cool ? <EOS>
the number of buttons ? <EOS> i think it's very important in the in the design . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> you can make a very fancy design uh with putting the buttons on the right places . <EOS> and if you have less buttons you can do a lot more with <EOS>
with a good shape for the <EOS> and um also , a very interesting things i i i've seen on on on the one of the comp o our competitor is this wheel that we can use to navigate . <EOS> so so my feeling is that re regarding costs budget we have an an an target price , it's not possible to go s to go to l_c_d_ <EOS> and also to go to automatic speech recognition technologies . <EOS> uh first m m why not to go to l_c_d_ . <EOS> because um in fact as we are targeting uh t_v_ in fact we can use t_v_ screen as a screen to feedback to to give some feedback informations about what we could have . <EOS>
interesting idea . <EOS> okay . <EOS> well <EOS> it would it would be a solution for uh when your remote control is lost , <EOS> i mean when it has speech recognition then mm-hmm . <EOS> uh i then it doesn't matter where it is , my well it's we should be in range , or maybe it can respond and produce sound , so say where it is . <EOS> but the these are all quite fancy features <EOS> i'm not sure whether
uh-huh . <EOS> uh-huh . <EOS> mm-hmm . mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay , <EOS> so <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay , so just stick to to regular <EOS> okay . <EOS> um , right . <EOS> so basically the um <EOS> i'm just gonna just recap uh what i said at the start , <EOS> was that um the the whole point of this meeting was to f absolutely finalise who we're gonna aim this at , <EOS> and what exactly the product's gonna do . <EOS> so um just to recap on <EOS> are we all happy about the idea of um aiming the product at um the fifteen to thirty five bracket ? <EOS> um and also the funct the the actual functions of what it's gonna do . <EOS> do you wanna recap on that , craig ? <EOS>
okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> and we have think i got a new project requirement . <EOS> so i think uh teletext becomes outdated . <EOS> so the popularity of the since the popularity of the internet , <EOS> and i think we don't need lighting adaptive , <EOS> so the remote control should be only used for the the television . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> okay . <EOS> specialised for game playing or interactive television . <EOS> they they've recently brought out this new remote control , <EOS> for people to set their favourite channels , or um to record things . <EOS> instead of people entering in what time things start , you simply stri slide a bar to say what time it begins , <EOS> and slide another bar to say what time it ends , <EOS> you know that's <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> the other thing i want to discuss also is which kind of alimentation , electric alimentation do you want to have , <EOS> so will it be for example uh d uh solar energy alimentation <EOS> or will it be a battery like the classical battery <EOS> so . <EOS> and i think that for example for the alimentation it would be good to have <EOS>
well an eye-attracting feature which shouldn't be shouldn't be <EOS> actually when you are watching the t_v_ , when you are watching anything or listening to them , you hardly care about what is getting displayed here , <EOS> you know , <EOS> uh you want to uh <EOS> and this gives a protection to the l_c_d_ actually , giving a cover to that actually . gives a protection <EOS> because when it falls down or something
mm-hmm . yeah . <EOS> except from the on-off button . <EOS> oh okay . <EOS> well , <EOS> yeah . <EOS> but i i think w you'll use uh the switch channels buttons uh more often than the normal uh channel buttons , like one two three . <EOS> so maybe we can put that on the bottom . <EOS>
i i i <EOS> when we want to include i i <EOS> i'm doubting about this this component . <EOS> it it it it breaks <EOS> in your <EOS> mm . <EOS> 'kay <EOS> maybe <EOS> no <EOS> actually this is this is not going to protrude actually , <EOS> it it's n i it is jus <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> 'kay <EOS> the radio can be on and everything . <EOS> yep . <EOS> because i think s with speech recognition , if uh the the remote or like the telephone it has a exact word that it has to hear . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS>
probably . <EOS> we'll let you know when we're done , if we can go earlier . <EOS> thanks , yeah . <EOS> okay so you guys will be getting your modelling done now and uh <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay are there any other questions with regards to what this thing's gonna do , look like , how it's gonna work that need to be addressed before we really look at this in a lot of detail ? <EOS>
uh yes . <EOS> uh maybe we can do some marketing studies asking people if they're interested <EOS> and how <EOS> it it is an an interesting concept to see to have uh voice control . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> the smart controller . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> no kinetic also . <EOS> i don't i don't see the difference between kinetic and dynamo . <EOS> well maybe dynamo is like you have to actually <EOS> ah you have to ah okay i see so kinetic is really uh shaking the banana . <EOS> crazy . <EOS> okay . <EOS> so those banana is falling . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> so below forty is okay . <EOS> but we need an lower level which to s uh focus . <EOS> so is it from sixteen to forty ? is it from twenty to forty ? is it from thirty ? <EOS> yeah ? 'kay . <EOS>
mm . um . <EOS> okay . yeah . <EOS> that's it . <EOS> right . um , <EOS> if we could hear from our industrial engineer , or designer . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> uh , i was still working on stuff , <EOS> i hadn't got it finished . <EOS> um , alright . <EOS> click to save in <EOS> where do i have to save it ? <EOS>
mm maybe . i dunno , <EOS> but yeah we'll <EOS> like zapping is just switching one channel at a time . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> maybe it's not easy if it's below . <EOS> it's harder to zap . <EOS> so i think uh it should be should be easy to . <EOS> i think it's pretty standard , these rubber buttons on the top . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> ah . <EOS> doesn't matter . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> no . <EOS> yep . <EOS> so that it's better in your hand or something uh . <EOS> but uh and and uh a microph microphone for the speech uh recognition if we want to implement that . <EOS>
solar . <EOS> well they're not designed <EOS> y i think <EOS> yeah , practically . <EOS> practical-wise okay . <EOS> i mean calculators you don't really throw around a lot <EOS> whereas remotes you do , <EOS> they can t <EOS> you do get a bit of wear <EOS> but don't calculators have a battery in them as well ? <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> for our base one ? <EOS> yeah , <EOS> or like a gun-metal grey , <EOS> 'cause then it combines the silver and the black . <EOS> what are your thoughts ? <EOS> gun-metal gray . <EOS> there you go , gun-metal gray . <EOS>
okay okay okay okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> sorry , <EOS> i have them <EOS> alright , now here's the sixty million dollar question , <EOS> well , twenty five twenty five euro question . <EOS> of course i'll buy the banana . <EOS> what do you what do you guys reckon ? <EOS>
mm . <EOS> they're ears , by the way . <EOS> no . <EOS> um close though . <EOS> 's a cat . <EOS> okay so <EOS> like a pet animal . <EOS> okay . <EOS> like a cat . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> it's like a cat , <EOS> so i guess it's a cat . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> mm okay , <EOS> seems to be interesting , mm . <EOS> and so <EOS> the last point is y also would do you want to have some very cheap integrated cir circuits , chips , or do you have low level or or very very expensive , <EOS> it depends , <EOS> but i think that low level will be , you know , it is an interim module . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . mm , mm . <EOS> that's quite annoying . <EOS> maybe um just like a simple thing to have a clip on it , like so you can clip it to your <EOS> like that's another <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , clip . <EOS> ooh . <EOS> um . <EOS>
what's on the uh on the left ? <EOS> okay . <EOS> oh god , <EOS> why is it doing that ? <EOS> ooh . <EOS> there we go . <EOS> so basically , um in order to save our two euros um i was thinking that we could have essentially the same shape , but just have it flattened . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> mm-hmm , mm-hmm . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> so , that's pretty much all i had to say , <EOS> i mean , everything else in terms of design issues . <EOS> um the centering of the key pad and the channel is just depending on where your thumb is <EOS> and you tend to use the the volume control and uh the browsing more than the actual number pad , <EOS> so that would be sort of in direct line of where your thumb goes when you are holding the remote control , <EOS> the number pad a little bit lower 'cause it's used less frequently . <EOS>
yeah , i think . <EOS> ah okay . <EOS> and uh also for the v_c_r_ and uh d_v_d_ player <EOS> and <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah , everything <EOS> just <EOS> so a lot of buttons on the remote control . <EOS> yeah , probably . <EOS> not just a t_v_ . <EOS>
it not v_h_s_ here ? <EOS> yeah , other than that region and coding thing . <EOS> um <EOS> but v_c_r_s <EOS> and and if we're if we're targeting young professionals and teenagers , i mean it's gonna be d_v_d_ type , that's the the technology these days . <EOS> yeah . yeah , for sure . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yep . <EOS> and especially i guess 'cause this has the speech recognition as well , <EOS> and that makes it more appealing , <EOS> it's more of a a new fun toy . <EOS> we have to practically test it . <EOS> the field test will tell you how good . <EOS>
uh . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> that's uh what i told you . <EOS> the remote control should only be used for a television . <EOS> so <EOS> that's maybe easier . <EOS> and um the the forty plus people , i already told you . <EOS> oh <EOS> no , <EOS> sorry . <EOS> oh , this is a problem . <EOS> oh sorry about that . <EOS> the new product should reach a new market with customers are the younger than forty . <EOS> so it should be flashy or just more interesting . <EOS> i'm sorry about that . <EOS> i just i just didn't read it well . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> uh and uh , <EOS> yeah , <EOS> and also uh using of colouring compon components <EOS> like uh if we want to have different colours , blue , red , green , so uh uh we have to use uh some colouring compone compone components . <EOS>
okay wi <EOS> oh . by the way . um <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i uh thought up a name for our product . <EOS> yeah . it's called uh the real remote . <EOS> yeah ? <EOS> oh right . <EOS> ooh . <EOS> with a copyright sign after real . <EOS>
yeah , yeah . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> huh . <EOS> it seems planned you know . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah i kinda thought that um <EOS> i felt like i would go and like try to use my information , <EOS> or like i'd make this stupid little presentation <EOS> and then like i just would end up talking about something completely unrelated <EOS> because <EOS> i dunno <EOS> i felt like i was off-task all the time . <EOS> but um <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> integrating the uh the remote with the device it's controlling . um <EOS> concern about our market . <EOS> um , if we are <EOS> i mean most of the uh of the replacement remote market is sort of remote control rationalisation . <EOS> um , you've got twenty different devices in your living room , <EOS> you want one wo y you want one that'll do the job of all of them . <EOS> um , if all you're replacing is one of the you know however many remotes you have in your living room , um you know you still need separate remotes for everything else . <EOS> i just think that uh possibly <EOS> mm . <EOS>
it's a horse . <EOS> this is why you're the designer . <EOS> and i'm marketing . <EOS> yes . yes , yes this is yes definitely a horse . yes . <EOS> oh very good . so <EOS> ah <EOS> i suppose it <EOS> ah <EOS> i think you can put that . <EOS>
well i think th i think the design and technology has to come back and say , okay to create this product we see it's gonna cost us this much for this volume , <EOS> because we do have a volume target of of fifty million profit . <EOS> yeah no <EOS> i i think that's where we really should be more flexible than anything else <EOS> because as we said in the last meeting , our management is really looking for us to push our brand . <EOS> we're entering a new market here , <EOS> so i think the the profit expectation for this one product is maybe not as important as being able to <EOS>
like kids won't break it , it's not breakable if you throw it around . <EOS> especially with younger kids , you know they can pick it up and and <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> the only thing is is that really small kids might chew on it , but <EOS>
and it's fabulous . <EOS> it's in the project documents . <EOS> or anything that didn't go as smoothly as you'd hope ? <EOS> and my main difficulty was the the time pressure . <EOS> otherwise it's it's all fine . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , yeah , <EOS> sometimes it's like a little bit rushed . <EOS>
oh , <EOS> that was profiting , <EOS> that was an amount , so that's the amount made , <EOS> okay . <EOS> yep . <EOS> well , <EOS> fifty million , <EOS> and if you're making twelve point five euros on each one , then , awful lot need to be sold . <EOS>
right , <EOS> sure . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah <EOS> so yeah should we go with that ? <EOS> um can we yeah like to and wha like do you have a <EOS> do you wanna draw it on the board ? <EOS> can you like <EOS> yeah just t we can visualize it . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> a customisable and <EOS> nice beautiful mahogany red wooden case . <EOS> what about the buttons , would would the buttons be wood too , or <EOS> uh i don't think so , no , <EOS> i think they could be rubber like they are now , <EOS> so you have that tactile experience of <EOS>
oh my . <EOS> i know . <EOS> let me one more space . <EOS> gonna zoom in real quick . <EOS> okay . <EOS> hand dynamo . <EOS> we're using kinetic battery , <EOS> right ? <EOS> uh we're n using kinetic , yeah . <EOS> um and we're having one per <EOS>
well <EOS> what kind of coaching is that really ? <EOS> what if i really needed something . <EOS> i so <EOS> i don't <EOS> n i think there was a lot of room for creativity , <EOS> we could do whatever basically what we wanted until the budget came down on us , um . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> yeah ? <EOS> okay . <EOS> maybe . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so , <EOS> for interface we said also that we have uh this banana shape with button on the s on the side . <EOS> and <EOS> and uh a wheel on the top . <EOS>
yeah , <EOS> but but why not work here together , for example ? <EOS> why should we be separated from each other in those difference uh different rooms ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , you could <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . well , <EOS> probably to simulate the whole working uh process , <EOS> huh , <EOS> th <EOS> you can't have a meeting uh for several weeks . <EOS>
hm ? <EOS> no , any any order's fine . yeah . <EOS> first . <EOS> okay . <EOS> um , how do i put this <EOS> i'll just put the cable in . <EOS> just uh <EOS> oh yeah , <EOS> sorry . <EOS> is that it ? <EOS> can you see ? <EOS> oh , here . okay . <EOS> so what happens it doesn't work ? <EOS>
mm-hmm , okay . <EOS> so uh <EOS> we discussed an <EOS> excuse me . <EOS> so <EOS> we would like to propose battery instead of solar cells <EOS> and it would be problematic uh to have enough energy with the solar cells <EOS> and so we would like to just use simple battery . <EOS> and also we want to go for titanium design instead of rubber or <EOS> and <EOS> well <EOS> the problem is with this design we found that we can't use double-curved shapes . <EOS>
yeah , teletext . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> and there's also a <EOS> and other other less important things are screen settings , audio settings , and channel settings , <EOS> but yeah , <EOS> they are less important , <EOS> but i think they should be there , <EOS> or not ? <EOS>
yeah ? if you can mix it it's okay . <EOS> mm-hmm . yeah . <EOS> yeah . that is my question also <EOS> because like new new functions <EOS> yeah . <EOS> well <EOS> i think that is the user requirements . yeah . <EOS> requirements part . as to what they want . uh do they want all those functions on that small <EOS>
so , just one second , <EOS> when you say double curve , what do you actually mean ? <EOS> you reckon you could like draw us a thing on the , on the whiteboard <EOS> 'cause i'm not sure <EOS> double curve is , you have curves on both the sides if i'm right . <EOS> so it's symmetrical kind of thing , whatever it is . <EOS>
well actually that that no that sample speaker is not we we're not using that , <EOS> we're just using the the very beep simple beep , <EOS> that s that sample thing is like the voice recording and everything . <EOS> so <EOS> the beep . <EOS> uh-huh . <EOS>
uh i think , and i think that uh <EOS> mm . <EOS> all this technology like i guess some people must be interested in using it <EOS> but i can't imagine finding it any more useful than like looking at someone's notes , <EOS> or like i dunno . <EOS>
yes . mm . <EOS> okay , <EOS> i'll uh hand over to agnes . <EOS> just gonna close this . <EOS> t <EOS> uh where are you , here ? <EOS> mm participant three . <EOS> participant three . <EOS> nope , <EOS> here <EOS> okay , <EOS> so i'll yep . <EOS> okay . <EOS>
mm yeah . <EOS> i don't know . <EOS> you decide . <EOS> you're the project manager . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> w he says <EOS> well yeah , if the technical functions have to be designed , i i've gotta know for what kind of machines they will be . <EOS> or do we use it a text screen ? <EOS> or uh will it be with uh with bluetooth or <EOS>
um . <EOS> i mean a power button's obviously <EOS> yes . <EOS> this i was thinking . do we need a power button at all ? <EOS> should should shouldn't we do it like sleep mode after five minutes of not using it ? <EOS> because generally <EOS> uh required . <EOS>
hmm . <EOS> for the uh both yeah user interface and functional design . yeah . <EOS> one thing it goes on to talk about , which is interesting , <EOS> is the <EOS> hang on a minute . <EOS> because if there are many numbers and we need to select to to constraint uh our design based on what is more important . <EOS>
ooh . <EOS> cool . <EOS> wow . <EOS> um did we decide on a chip ? <EOS> let's go with a simple chip ? <EOS> okay . <EOS> simple chip . <EOS> yep . <EOS> we are done . <EOS> thank you everyone . <EOS> oh <EOS> i di <EOS> these are already in our shared folder , so . <EOS>
do we want this thing to be able to be found easily ? <EOS> i think so . <EOS> what do you <EOS> sure , yeah . <EOS> a finding kind of device or <EOS> yeah , ho homing device . <EOS> and <EOS> i need <EOS> we we need a like homing device . <EOS>
that's stupid . <EOS> we'll see . <EOS> okay . <EOS> i don't agree . <EOS> mm . <EOS> sorry . <EOS> yeah , you had two choices . <EOS> that's gonna be draw . <EOS> or not . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> too bad . <EOS> i'll put it here . <EOS> you are going to put it there . <EOS> then
mm-hmm . <EOS> the finder feature yeah by whistling or whatever . <EOS> uh if you have the finder feature then you can also have <EOS> okay . <EOS> uh at the same time as and general voice commands if you want yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> so i think it should be a package in that case . <EOS> uh <EOS> so the user interface will consist of two parts . <EOS> one is the voice command part and on one is the actual buttons part . <EOS> uh and th the buttons part would be uh a set of buttons for choosing devices , a set of buttons for special navigation in space , <EOS>
hmm . <EOS> so , if we're trying to keep costs down , then maybe sacrificing the display is a way to go . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> i mean it depends on how much putting a display costs and what it would be used for <EOS> very specifically what it would be used for , <EOS> 'cause if it's only used for one little thing , then putting in a big display case or a big display that's probably expensive just to do the training on the chip for the speech recognition or whatever , may not be the most cost-efficient way to go , <EOS>
mm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm . <EOS> that does get annoying . <EOS> we're interested in in something more general , <EOS> but they suggested uh , you know , going i a little bit into a a niche , <EOS> like either gearing our remote towards kids , <EOS> where you could have lot of colours um , the keys might be you know , funny or or , <EOS> or uh something for the elderly , where the remote's very large and the buttons are very large and there's only a few buttons . <EOS> but you know we can we can discuss this , <EOS> but it sounded like from our last meeting we really wanted something that was general , but done well . <EOS> uh um <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i think we can just go to my presentation then . <EOS> we can wind up . <EOS> or we could uh come to some f uh final conclusions . <EOS> so the marketing made an evaluation criteria <EOS> and these were some of the findings , <EOS>
um , badger . <EOS> uh it's it's got nice contrast with black and white and uh <EOS> i feel they're underdog kind of status <EOS> and they're , the <EOS> mm and why ? <EOS> uh-huh . <EOS> oh right <EOS> uh my my wife says my beard looks like a badger's arse <EOS> 'cause of the the white streaks in it . <EOS> kendra . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> mm . <EOS> whatever , have to buy one every half a year ? <EOS> okay so yeah , <EOS> so we want it to be sturdy , <EOS> we want it to to hold up to somebody's child , you know , throwing it across the room <EOS> or , as you said , <EOS> people kinda throw it , <EOS> so ball-shaped , uh you know , if it were ball-shaped maybe , <EOS> then it <EOS>
less important . yeah , <EOS> should be there , <EOS> but not press <EOS> yeah , sub-menu , yeah . <EOS> a sh <EOS> but in a sub sub-menu or something like that . <EOS> uh i think it's also important to uh make it possible to um how do you call it in english , uh , to not use batteries , <EOS> and use ac uh bat uh batteries to uh to be <EOS> yeah yeah sure . indeed . <EOS> so uh you can mount uh the the the uh <EOS>
no . <EOS> so maybe you have to ask her . <EOS> yeah okay . well , <EOS> maybe we can just open images there , <EOS> and i'll paint and paint . <EOS> okay . yeah . <EOS> that's probably <EOS> i'll be able to do a better job . <EOS>
i would say <EOS> five ? <EOS> four is fair . <EOS> okay . <EOS> four . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> very non-committal , four . <EOS> okay , <EOS> the second one . <EOS> did we make it simple for new users ? <EOS> it's very intuitive , i think yeah . <EOS>
they're graceful . <EOS> sleek . <EOS> yeah they're sleek <EOS> and they look intelligent <EOS> and i don't know , they're <EOS> i guess it's the whole like binocular vision thing . <EOS> i don't know how intelligent that one looks . <EOS> yeah he he doesn't look that smart . <EOS> he's a i dunno um they're <EOS> i think it's cool the the um the interaction that or the th things that the reasons people seem to like you know <EOS> you get ex you know people are sitting on the beach and p they're like oh look there's dolphins and it's kinda like <EOS> but they're you know they jump around in the water and they're happy and they're mammals , but they swim . <EOS>
that would 've speech recogn right . <EOS> so , <EOS> we're looking at <EOS> um well <EOS> again , we don't know the relative proportion the relative numbers in the age groups . <EOS> yeah , that's true . <EOS> if we wanted something different , truly different , then the buttonless remote control w would be it . <EOS>
something i was wondering about was the power . <EOS> um , is it worth considering like having like a charging unit as opposed to just regular batteries ? <EOS> i mean is that something we really want to go into , do you think , <EOS> or should we just consider running on regular batteries ? <EOS>
no . <EOS> then a little uh thing about the last meeting . <EOS> uh these are the points um we agreed on . the requirements and the target market . <EOS> uh requirements are uh teletext , docking station , audio signal , small screen , with some extras that uh button information . <EOS> and we are going to use default materials . <EOS> um does somebody have any comments on these requirements ? maybe ? <EOS> no ? <EOS> these are just the the things we thought of , <EOS> so maybe if you figured something else or thought of something else , just let me know . <EOS> and maybe we can uh work it out . and we're going to target uh sixty to to eighty year old customers . <EOS> so <EOS> now everybody knows what we're do we're doing , <EOS> um i suggest let's get started with the presentations . <EOS> so <EOS> shall we keep the same uh line-up as uh last time ? <EOS>
um besides that we would advise um to bring two editions , one with a wood-like colour and maybe feel , and one with a grey-black colour . <EOS> the wood-like for the more uh exclusive people . people with more money . <EOS> uh the grey-black colour for well people with less means . <EOS>
right . <EOS> also when it comes to the ergonomics of the whole thing , if you wanna make it square for the looks of it , then maybe to make it more comfortable to hold the whole thing , you add a little bulge down here . <EOS> just <EOS> which maybe from an engineering point this could be holding the the batteries and so on . <EOS>
oh . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> oh , okay , that would be cool . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> ah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> just nice feel , but i hate spongy . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> c that's e that would be kind of oh , <EOS> you know , usually like the touch pad things are kind of a hard plastic typ mouse type , you know , thing . <EOS> but what if we ha what if we had like a spongy sort of like stress balley kinda <EOS> so you're like <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah maybe we could come at some say five , six des designs <EOS> and then choose which are whichever appeals the most like , <EOS> that could be the most common design . <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> okay . <EOS>
now the most important feature i would like to have in my remote would be the speech recognition feature . <EOS> it's an integrated progra programmable sample sensor speaker unit . <EOS> so a remote can be th can be uh designed which can have the voice recognisers , you can record your own voice <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> but is it a significant price on the whole remote control ? <EOS> because we can afford up to twelve euros for the price of the remote control . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah <EOS> i i th <EOS> so will will will this with uh including all possible things , so buttons , wheel and the chip , be uh lower than twelve euros to produce ? <EOS>
yeah , that's our target . yeah . <EOS> it's our main target . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> lower than forty years , i think <EOS> it was . <EOS> well <EOS> and how about my idea uh of making it um with one single curve ? <EOS>
uh the s the screen is okay , but the board , uh that's the problem . <EOS> well what what would you guess as a shape ? <EOS> or what what would be the shape ? <EOS> mm . <EOS> i think i think their being uh large or small is not important . <EOS> the only important thing is to be able to take it in uh inside hand easily . <EOS> so let's say an average size , okay , <EOS> and it should not be very heavy also . <EOS> and i prefer to is it shouldn't have a uniform shape , <EOS> so in the middle it should be a little bit thinner , maybe maybe . <EOS> so we c it's like like some joysticks . <EOS> you can take uh some some joystick you can take inside hand easier because it's it's designed for your f uh taking into account your finger shape and your palm shape . <EOS> so the general shape should be like this . <EOS> i think uh seven centimetre by seven centimetre is a little bit large . <EOS> so uh seven not seven but let's say five by ten it's i think it's that's my opinion . it's easier . <EOS>
hmm . <EOS> yeah , it smells funny doesn't it . um <EOS> and some play-dohs are actually i think edible <EOS> aren't they ? <EOS> no , all play-doh is edible . <EOS> yeah like the stuff for <EOS> i think it has to be , yeah . <EOS> i think they're all non-toxic 'cause it's aimed for like two-year-olds . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah , okay . <EOS> yeah , scale model , yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> um and <EOS> um then the buttons . <EOS> yeah kind of self-explanatory , just buttons whenever you need them . <EOS> tried to keep it simple . <EOS> oh that's the charging base prongs at the bottom . <EOS> we used those . <EOS> and um then the big red button in the middle is the on and off one . <EOS> it's not in the traditional place , <EOS> but um it's quite an obvious place . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> oh , that's not gonna work . <EOS> oh , alright . <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> um alright . <EOS> uh , uh , um . <EOS> i'll just put that there . <EOS> uh as you all know we're here to create a brand new fantastic remote . <EOS> uh i'm nick debusk , <EOS> i'm the project manager . <EOS> uh we'll just get started with everyone kind of letting each other know who they are and what you're doing , what your what your role is um . <EOS> go ahead . <EOS>
this will think this will take more time to develop also . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah of course of course . <EOS> and um <EOS> but for a standard one this is really easy . <EOS> it's a question of one month and so on s <EOS> soon . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> what is a double-curved shape ? <EOS> like you can have two curves . <EOS> uh-huh . <EOS> why ? <EOS> uh it's i think in manufacturing i guess it's problematic . <EOS> so , <EOS> we want to go for simple push buttons <EOS> because it need a simple chip <EOS> and it's really lesser uh re really less expensive compared to l_c_d_ <EOS> which are <EOS> uh which needs advanced chip technology <EOS> and it's more expensive , <EOS> since we want to put some other features such as speech recognition <EOS> we want to reduce uh cost . <EOS>
yeah , <EOS> but you need a receiver to recognize the gestures and the voice . <EOS> but it will be embedded on the t_v_ and not on the remote control , <EOS> so . <EOS> that's true . <EOS> yeah <EOS> d <EOS> okay . <EOS> i dunno . <EOS>
yeah <EOS> but <EOS> but you have extra buttons . <EOS> so people can get confused . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> that is true . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> especially if they have the same writings on it . <EOS> see um yeah . <EOS> or we have to make a left uh for lefties <EOS> and <EOS>
manual controllers , eh . <EOS> no , <EOS> more expensive maybe . <EOS> how much ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> because i suppose we need to do research to have something working . <EOS> no no <EOS> we we d we we just are use um <EOS> uh if you if if you use the basic <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> like y so you're either in that mode or you're in the mode where like it just has like the four like you know this is channel that way , that's that way and volume is up and down . <EOS> yeah but it knows for some reason . <EOS> the ipod knows . <EOS>
well each unit is is sell uh twenty five euros . <EOS> yeah <EOS> but how many yeah . <EOS> how muc how much do you get how much do you if you buy one million units <EOS> h no , one hundred thousand units . <EOS> eh chips . <EOS> we're gonna need chips right . <EOS>
yep . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so does anyone have any overall <EOS> well uh what comes up for me is that if we're gonna if we're gonna be marketing a product that is going to be uh having no teletext , people are very comfortable with the idea of having teletext and using teletext , and so we're not we're gonna be a new product without something that people are very comfortable having right now . <EOS>
curves , curves . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> you've more there as well . <EOS> yeah , okay . <EOS> it wasn't very small one . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> very simple . <EOS> that is for elderly . <EOS> so <EOS> we have to make a decision , <EOS> what kind of form it's gonna have t going to have . <EOS>
and so it's like <EOS> couldn't we do that all through one button , <EOS> something , a menu button , that pops up with a menu on the t_v_ that says , you know , audio , video , whatever , language , <EOS> you know ? <EOS> i don't well , i don't know . <EOS> right . <EOS>
okay <EOS> what is your email ? <EOS> at participant one . okay . <EOS> participant one at ami . <EOS> okay . <EOS> so see you after lunch break . <EOS> 'kay thank you . <EOS> well during lunch break actually . <EOS> so next time we should have a fight . <EOS>
okay , <EOS> so that's a one . <EOS> you know , <EOS> where that's <EOS> totally . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i'd say we're doing well there . <EOS> okay , <EOS> that was good . <EOS> easy to use interface , buttons menu , menus <EOS> that's <EOS> yeah <EOS> that's good . <EOS> 'kay <EOS> that's <EOS> we're not doing so badly . <EOS> um easy to use <EOS> oh okay , <EOS> let's forget that one . <EOS> fancy looking . <EOS>
we put the fashion in electronics . <EOS> there you go . <EOS> mm . <EOS> i think i think we have to carry that mental . <EOS> so it's kinda gotta look it's gotta look new and s you know something fashionable . <EOS> if if remote control well , if telephones can be fashionable , then maybe remote control units can be . <EOS>
no , i don't uh i don't like it . <EOS> no . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> so <EOS> and then yeah we saw the the pla display , in the the ipod . <EOS> they can put the basic buttons , one , two , three , four . and uh f above ten . <EOS> and i think <EOS>
mm . <EOS> gosh , <EOS> must be some telly addicts out there if they get r_s_i_ from their television remote , is all i can say . <EOS> but uh yeah . <EOS> it also asked um if we would if people would pay more for speech recognition <EOS> and younger people say they would . <EOS>
. <EOS> a hundred people were tested in a usability laboratory <EOS> through just their habits to n know <EOS> their habits were observed and questionnaires were given out . <EOS> um , the findings in in some cases matched what we were talking about . <EOS> custome customers and users don't like the way remote controls look , <EOS> they don't like the way they feel , <EOS> they don't think they match their operating behaviour , <EOS> and an example is what we were talking about , the buttons , they only use ten per cent of the buttons , <EOS> so later on there's a study of the buttons that they use most <EOS> and i think we should design according to these buttons . <EOS> easy to lose , and r_s_i_ . <EOS> i don't know what r_s_i_ means . <EOS> um the person that did the questionnaire obviously did , i don't have a clue . <EOS>
. <EOS> i don't know . <EOS> well , i think we should set the the points to to drive the project and uh <EOS> mm . <EOS> b did you send us an email about this ? <EOS> uh , not yet , <EOS> but if you want <EOS> yeah , we we received an email about this uh d designs . <EOS>
okay . alright . <EOS> guess we're getting straight back into business here . <EOS> um the selling price for our remote is going to be twenty-five euro , <EOS> and our profit aim is fifty million euro . <EOS> we're going to make this an international product marketed in the states , in europe , in asia . <EOS> and um our production cost to make that profit is gonna be a max of twelve fifty euro per remote . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> usually what's done is you have this big booklet full of different possi <EOS> you'll have all of them sort of programmed in to the uh remote , <EOS> and you'll have this little booklet of codes <EOS> you then find your um ma uh find your manufacturer <EOS> and try the different codes <EOS> that <EOS>
right . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i guess i'll find out . <EOS> you'll be looking you'll be looking at the user interface concept , <EOS> on something conceptual <EOS> and you're watching trends to see how we go <EOS> and surely voice recognition'll fall off the map or something that <EOS> um we'll keep keep our options op hmm ? <EOS>
uh how mm-hmm <EOS> how are we going to achieve this high-end product if <EOS> well we h something has to go to the tune of two point t three euro , <EOS> so <EOS> let me see , <EOS> what are we <EOS> i mean <EOS> oh yes <EOS> sorry , <EOS> four point three . <EOS> my maths is all out . <EOS>
mm , mm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> right . <EOS> 'kay . <EOS> be good . <EOS> so <EOS> generally , all remotes are sort of quite similar in their appearance . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> do we want <EOS> so they're kinda like long and rectangular . <EOS> do we want something crazy ? <EOS> you know , <EOS> we want something new that's gonna stand out . <EOS> a m a modern so our remote should be <EOS>
i think it's a pig . <EOS> ah okay . <EOS> a pig ? <EOS> i can make <EOS> a dog . <EOS> no , <EOS> it's a dog . <EOS> or a dog . <EOS> um <EOS> a sheep ? <EOS> uh we d only have twenty five minutes , <EOS> so . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yep . <EOS> sure , <EOS> we can discuss that maybe after the next one . <EOS> do you want to <EOS> yeah . <EOS> cool . <EOS> do you wanna give me the little cable thing ? <EOS>
right . <EOS> okay . um okay , <EOS> so c_ . <EOS> are are we admitting defeat on c_ <EOS> or are we saying we're gonna stick a locator on the t_v_ ? <EOS> there's a locator . <EOS> cool , <EOS> so that means you need a that does mean you need a little speaker on it though , <EOS> doesn't it ? <EOS> to make it beep . <EOS> or a buzzer . <EOS>
good morning , again . <EOS> one question . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> choose a number ? <EOS> send . <EOS> submit . <EOS> yep yep yep yep . <EOS> all set ? <EOS> good . <EOS> okay . <EOS> mm . yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> let's see what we can find here . <EOS>
i think between the two , somewhere between the two is true . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> i'd <EOS> it's more true than false , about a two . <EOS> okay . <EOS> so <EOS> we say true . <EOS> um technologically innovative . <EOS> i d i don't think that's what we're aiming at with this concept . <EOS> i think we're using simple components that are gonna be robust but not particularly innovative . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> i think maybe just draw on the kind of fruit and vegetable shape . <EOS> and what else did you say about fashions ? <EOS> what was trendy ? <EOS> okay , okay . <EOS> uh the fashion trend shows that fruits and vegetables , <EOS> like people uh now <EOS>
yes . <EOS> yes . yes . <EOS> one man one vote . <EOS> s so who thinks the the l_c_d_ disply display should be i should be in it ? <EOS> okay . <EOS> i th i'd like t it to be in but i can't see it happening . i can't see it fitting in . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> you can get a lot more information on it . <EOS> to browse more easily the teletext . for instance through uh through your remote control . <EOS> so what would what would appear in the in the l_c_d_ ? <EOS> so you could have the name of the programme , you could have um the start time you know where it's up to . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> uh <EOS> genetically modified mushroom i will say , but <EOS> keep on speaking . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay , <EOS> yeah , so next slide . <EOS> so there are several key features of our pr prototype . <EOS> the first is that it is fuzzy . <EOS> i'm sure this would be the unique design the market . <EOS> yeah , so it's a fuzzy design , and a unique design . <EOS> um , and uh <EOS>
that kind of annoys me though , when it's zero six when you have to press <EOS> i don't know why . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah but you don't have to press zeros . <EOS> you could just press six enter , <EOS> or one two enter . <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
like trendy no like f for earlier we saw maybe it should be something trendy you know . <EOS> maybe it should different colours or materials or you know . <EOS> um so yeah shapes right , you know , <EOS> like kidney shape feels better in your hand or something , you know . <EOS>
and uh now with david . <EOS> mm 'kay um . <EOS> i think i'm cool . <EOS> it's a shame the cable wasn't just in the middle of the table , <EOS> huh ? <EOS> just um <EOS> i know it'd be handy , wouldn't it . <EOS> oops . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> okay . <EOS> so , what are we doing with the settings ? <EOS> because settings <EOS> if we want to do settings we need buttons for that <EOS> and we want less buttons , so . <EOS> maybe with the l_c_d_ we can do something with less buttons , but <EOS>
no . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i think you you have to make it a bit flashy and and popular . <EOS> and uh then the usability is not that required , <EOS> because the like in the mobile phones , usability is not that good i think . <EOS> but uh some of you had uh something to read about um uh speech uh recognition . <EOS> about you said one and the television turns on one . <EOS> is that reachable maybe ? <EOS> that's very that's fancy . that's cool . <EOS> twelve and you've got twelve . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> just in time . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> and if we if we're just having buttons and the speech then we're getting our cheapest option of chipping . <EOS> right , right . <EOS> that's good . <EOS> uh woah . <EOS> okay , we're we're kind of uh we're kind of um <EOS> excuse m <EOS> i've just deleted that whole thing . <EOS> um we're kind of running out of time , <EOS> so if you could <EOS>
but the <EOS> remember the management said that it it had to be prominent . <EOS> not in <EOS> whoops . <EOS> oh it just had to be on there i guess . <EOS> should just not touch it . <EOS> this time it's the three i killed . <EOS> i was just wondering if it should be like flatter . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> and also for people who are a bit colourblind . <EOS> colourblind yeah . <EOS> yeah . true . <EOS> no so that's mostly red and green i believe . <EOS> which which uh colour should the buttons be ? <EOS> that's adjustable . <EOS>
sorry . <EOS> uh . <EOS> on my agenda . <EOS> s um <EOS> presumably there's clay somewhere . <EOS> um . <EOS> four . <EOS> yeah , that's great . <EOS> whoops . <EOS> light , light , please . light . <EOS> right , there you go . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> uh rem <EOS> so <EOS> just flip it a hundred and eighty degrees around <EOS> then you get here . <EOS> if you can have this one , you turn it like this . <EOS> and then flip it upside down . <EOS> yeah <EOS> but this place um <EOS> uh it's <EOS> yeah <EOS> i dunno um <EOS>
one remote . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> um yeah . <EOS> got uh many functions in one uh remote control , <EOS> um but um yeah <EOS> you can see , this is uh quite simple uh remote control . <EOS> um few uh buttons <EOS> but uh this uh re uh remote control got a a lot of uh buttons . <EOS> um uh people uh don't like it , <EOS> uh so um <EOS>
oh right , okay , you've got more , okay . <EOS> sorry uh . <EOS> it didn't bother to tell me that on this <EOS> yeah , yeah . <EOS> oh , you got a presentation , <EOS> sorry . <EOS> oh ok <EOS> s <EOS> thing . <EOS> is it ? <EOS> okay . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> so that means no locator , does it ? <EOS> i mean does <EOS> what else does it need ? <EOS> well the speaker uh the sample speaker is is expensive , <EOS> but we could just have some some very very easy device that just beeps . <EOS>
yes <EOS> if it was something as simple as you couldn't change the channel , <EOS> but i mean for if there were any more <EOS> or are we absolutely definite it's only gonna be for t_v_ and video , <EOS> we're not gonna put any <EOS> okay , just a thought . <EOS>
you don't need to every five minutes to keep it alive . <EOS> uh probably . <EOS> okay , so we should keep this button . <EOS> i mean based on our usability studies again , um pe um people said that the power button was v a very relevant button . <EOS> um , you know , it was nine out of ten <EOS>
we're all about that . <EOS> okay , so we could have keys that are like a b like a broccoli key and a uh and an avocado key on them . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> rubber things . <EOS> i wanna watch the pineapple channel . <EOS>
well if it's a trendy original , um , aspect we're going for . <EOS> i mean , you're the designers , you c , you can um decide what kind of , um , direction you wanna go in , <EOS> but at this point in the , in the first meeting it can be any ideas that we just throw out there . <EOS>
. <EOS> you get email , . <EOS> i dunno from who . <EOS> from the account manager . <EOS> you have received the same email , right ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , from the account manager . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i think it's for your guys to how to design it all the aspects so you need that information . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> good point . <EOS> this is , it's <EOS> the up and down buttons are used for scrolling up and down for a list of choices . <EOS> you find the choice that you want <EOS> and you press uh you press the right button uh . <EOS>
we'll be available . <EOS> but do we have to <EOS> we'll work together , <EOS> but do we have to stay here , <EOS> or do we <EOS> well <EOS> i i'd say just wait uh for email and uh find out . <EOS> i don't know . <EOS> okay well <EOS> that was what i had to say , uh , <EOS>
okay . <EOS> and u_i_d_ , the technical fun functions design , <EOS> making sure it does everything that we need the remote to do , the functionality of it , operating all those different things . <EOS> okay . <EOS> and the marketing person , that's courtney , is going to do the user requirements specification . <EOS>
right . <EOS> mm . <EOS> and they slide . <EOS> yes . <EOS> well <EOS> and do we wanna consider like an ipod screen <EOS> which isn't a touch screen <EOS> but you're still scrolling through menu options , <EOS> in p <EOS> think then we're hitting our cost issue again . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so we we can check into the financial feasibility of incorporating this . <EOS> my personal preferences would be like , <EOS> as already uh marketing department , they want something to do with fruit <EOS> so i wouldn't say the design should be like a fruit , <EOS> but yeah we can take inspiration from fruit colours , like the vibrant colours , uh red chilli uh <EOS>
look and feel de <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> mm sounds interesting . <EOS> mm-hmm <EOS> um and i as always your personal coach will send you specific instruction . <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> thanks . <EOS> so , <EOS> can we highlight the specific features of our <EOS> yeah , so so <EOS> we want the speech recogniser <EOS> and we want some kind of buttons <EOS> and we want some themes like fruits or vegetables , <EOS> that's <EOS> we want to follow general trend . <EOS>
the one on the right is a lot more basic . <EOS> it's just got the essential functions of the t_v_ changing the channel , play , stop , volume . <EOS> it would be a lot quicker to learn to use it , <EOS> but again th it's it's swings and roundabouts . <EOS> there are disadvantages , <EOS> you can't use it say to to freeze the television picture . <EOS> uh there's a lot of features that are missing from that remote control . <EOS> so we've got to to find our find a way of striking a balance between the two . <EOS>
oh no , yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> um , s hang on . <EOS> then you can connect this one or this one <EOS> yeah . <EOS> you can connect this one . all to your computer . <EOS> yeah . well . <EOS> so these are important numbers <EOS> that matthew and i need to take into account for our functional um <EOS>
that's true . <EOS> so we can make it small if we have a l locating device . <EOS> if we do a voice-activated locator , though , we're gonna be looking at a more substantial chip . <EOS> so <EOS> yeah . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> so i that's the other thing , <EOS> it's like you know <EOS> are we gonna have certain chips that are gonna require bigger size period ? <EOS>
okay . <EOS> okay , i accept the minutes . <EOS> and uh <EOS> okay . <EOS> is that what we're supposed to say ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> good . <EOS> um , then we'll move to the three presentations . <EOS> yeah , i do . <EOS> okay ? <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> so , <EOS> that about finance . <EOS> and uh now just let have some discussion about what is a good remote control <EOS> and uh well keep in mind this this first point , it has to be original , <EOS> it has to be trendy , <EOS> it has to be user friendly . <EOS> um , maybe someone can mention some additional uh prerequisites for a good remote control . <EOS>
technology . <EOS> well , we are making the chip . <EOS> so , i mean <EOS> hmm . <EOS> but , i guess , we have to look at w what our production cost is for the chip itself anyway . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> and it is a growing trend , the higher technological , like <EOS>
um and did you try to make a new design , <EOS> or what were you trying to do ? <EOS> yeah , <EOS> i tried to copy that one , <EOS> but it didn't work . <EOS> it didn't work . <EOS> so we could fix it like tha that it's like this . <EOS>
oh yeah yeah . it'll be really cheap . <EOS> or maybe you can like have a a smell-o-rama , <EOS> you know you push a button and it s puts out a stink . <EOS> you can <EOS> maybe not <EOS> . makes your living room more fresh as you watch . <EOS>
so for the first one , we need to decide , did we solved the problem of the users who complained about an ugly remote ? <EOS> . <EOS> i think it's definitely different than anything else out there . <EOS> so if they think that what is out there is ugly , then yes i would say , i would say most definitely . <EOS> it's bright . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> oh well , potato , mango , fruit and veg . <EOS> we we were we were thinking about <EOS> yeah . <EOS> it's mango . <EOS> it's mango . <EOS> potato's fine . potato's fine . <EOS> yeah . totally . <EOS> it's really adaptable . <EOS>
sure . <EOS> um . you're participant <EOS> s <EOS> i'm number two . <EOS> two ? <EOS> that's it . <EOS> do you want the mouse , <EOS> or do you want me to <EOS> i'll do the notes . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> thanks . <EOS> so um well <EOS> i i figured uh we should um identify some user requirements , <EOS> and from my experience , i wanna uh , and from research i did , uh the the device has to turn the television on and off the first time you press on the big button , <EOS> you can't uh can't have like uh waffling on this point , you know . <EOS> really have <EOS>
mm . <EOS> okay , alright . <EOS> so so the most functional des mm <EOS> the most important function is to ch choo buttons to choose the content . right ? <EOS> we agree on that , right ? <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> uh , uh first one is to uh buttons i or it could be anything with buttons . uh to choose uh content s or channels . <EOS> so we have both . <EOS> the user can choose w which one they want , right ? <EOS>
do you <EOS> would you a argue that that we're better going for the higher cost than bringing it down into twenty f five as we probably could , but lowering our profit margins ? <EOS> that that would be uh that would be i think a decision best made by corporate <EOS> um i i m <EOS> for my evaluation , based on what our competition is , i th i think that that we can go after this <EOS> and and and go after more of the uh exclusivity sense than the mass market sense . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> but if you can imagine that in like a s just a maybe uh a kind of pale metallic-y finish or something <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> a metallic-y finish we were thinking . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> well i know know it's for rubber . <EOS> i mean diff if you can visualise this in nice colours i think it would look quite fancy . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> hey , <EOS> . <EOS> um yeah . yeah <EOS> the the young people do like uh scroll uh yeah . <EOS> use the scroll . <EOS> yeah i think so too . <EOS> so why not , on on side . <EOS> yeah ? you do like it ? <EOS>
okay . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so we'll have to evaluate the uh your proposed remote control , <EOS> and um have an idea of the price that uh this thing will cost . <EOS> 'kay . <EOS> and in case <EOS> if we're we all agree on the fabrica of um building of this remote control , we'll evaluate the um production . <EOS> so <EOS> maybe i will let the our two designers talk about so their <EOS> you have s <EOS> oh , sorry . <EOS> oops . <EOS>
it's maybe a little bit expensive . <EOS> it's cheap , yeah . <EOS> no , i <EOS> i'm not so happy about the fruit shape , you know . <EOS> wh really ? <EOS> it should be it should be fine , you know , actually . s <EOS> okay . <EOS>
we just diske discuss it as you designed it <EOS> and then we will will try to get it in the budget . <EOS> okay . <EOS> so the cost for these were <EOS> what was the cost for the first one ? eight euros ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> and i think , i think there would be a good market for it . <EOS> so <EOS> that's the <EOS> if we're able to really bring an innovative product . <EOS> now you're talking about sixty to eighty for example . <EOS> yeah the really <EOS> yeah . <EOS> sixty . <EOS>
we can just keep doing that ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> fifty f uh <EOS> seventy five per cent of users say they s zap a lot . <EOS> so mm we have to have a remote control uh very um out for that . <EOS> uh the buttons have are to be um uh uh like you say resist resisting to to shocks . <EOS> um and fifty per cents of users say they only use uh ten per cents of but of the buttons in the in the remote control . <EOS> so all the buttons we we have to put are have to to have um a use a real use <EOS> and not only or <EOS>
well uh <EOS> what i was reading on the page . uh a remote control just sends commands , basics commands to uh the television . <EOS> so <EOS> switch to channel six . <EOS> so uh <EOS> button six says says six . <EOS> and if you make favourites , it can say six six six in a row . <EOS> just numbers . <EOS> that can be in the in the <EOS>
look at it . <EOS> that is a piece of work . <EOS> wow . <EOS> marketing director says yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> fashionable chic people will . <EOS> you're kidding . <EOS> no , no . <EOS> no , marketing has to actually create the desire for it . <EOS>
it's quite sweet . <EOS> i think batteries sound good . <EOS> what does everyone else think ? <EOS> it it seems a little weird for a living room anyways . <EOS> the dynamo would be interesting . <EOS> no . but dynamo the the fact with dynamo is , the moment you move it , it c it creates energy on its own . <EOS>
yes . <EOS> sounds good . <EOS> okay . <EOS> we didn't come to any sort of decision on the functions though . <EOS> well <EOS> i think i went over the functions <EOS> and wrote them down <EOS> and marked them . <EOS> um that's what i went over and nobody was objecting to them . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> okay , <EOS> this <EOS> just to give us a rough idea of what we're meant to be doing for the next stage . <EOS> i'm pretty sure that you got that anyway . <EOS> this is the conceptual one . um . <EOS> mm . <EOS>
but but is it inc does it include a a homestation or <EOS> no , that's not on the list . <EOS> but that shouldn't be . <EOS> can we make that for uh h twenty cents ? <EOS> yeah , we can uh <EOS> probably . <EOS> i just <EOS> the b the button supplements , i didn't i d i was wondering if this special colour maybe was <EOS> i'm not sure . <EOS>
just copy the one on the left . <EOS> no <EOS> um a scroll <EOS> well , <EOS> like four buttons , up , down , left and right with enter in the middle , that will correspond to a menu on the screen . <EOS> which i think technically is just push button <EOS> and uh i'd certainly support that that <EOS> that brings the cost down quite a lot <EOS> and it's something that we're an ex the company's an expert on . <EOS>
well you told us when to start and when to end , and that's all that matters . <EOS> i think you were fine . <EOS> you did a good job leading . <EOS> yeah , well i'm never gonna do a management position , i know that now . <EOS> um yeah , i thought we all worked very well together . <EOS>
i think the scroll wheel um <EOS> also the display's for something else which we decided against . <EOS> um but that bit <EOS> okay . <EOS> and note that the push button just requires a simple chip , <EOS> so that would keep the price down . <EOS> down . <EOS>
calculator . <EOS> yeah . true . <EOS> true . <EOS> right . <EOS> right . <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> what do you think ron ? <EOS> okay i'm willing to agree with everything that's been said . <EOS> uh i have to say though that um another idea's come up in my head . <EOS> if we're really not uh handling the remote control to a great extent we could possibly get away from the idea of having a hand-held remote control <EOS> and maybe kind of have a round remote control <EOS> that kind of looks like a paperweight or something like that , kind of a sleek little uh neat thing that sits on your table or something . <EOS>
'kay uh . <EOS> yeah , there you go . <EOS> right . i just have to there's a few little bits and pieces i have to write down , but <EOS> take your headsets off , kick back , smoke 'em if you got 'em . <EOS>
hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i mean the thing is we do need to develop our technology of i mean actually how to program the menus <EOS> and what sort of , you know , text box is gonna appear at the bottom of the screen , <EOS> but we do definitely think that it's a viable option . <EOS>
yeah , we can relate it by advertising or <EOS> okay , so double-curved , single-curved , what do we feel ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> or we can do something , we can design two three shapes and we can have a public survey , let the public choose what they want . <EOS>
well , you have to make it work . <EOS> that's the that's the big thing . <EOS> yeah of g of course . <EOS> that's alright . <EOS> yeah , it should be easy to work with . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> we can think about an interface with uh well <EOS>
you got to go through . <EOS> it's either that or we only had forty minutes to discuss what we just discussed <EOS> and don't know how long that took . <EOS> i think we are pretty going in a clear direction now . <EOS> is everyone happy ? <EOS> okay . <EOS>
mm-hmm <EOS> oh , yeah . <EOS> right . <EOS> right . <EOS> yeah , mm-hmm . <EOS> okay . <EOS> mm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> right . <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> and um just a clarification before we finish this . <EOS> uh does c is our controller is it have the option of being um on a standard uh frequency as all of the other equipment , <EOS> so that the one controller can control several pieces of equipment ? <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> this cord's <EOS> uh . right . <EOS> actually i haven't thought of anything yet . <EOS> uh <EOS> it's a pig . <EOS> so i'm thinking we should design a remote control that's <EOS> water resistant , strong and furry . <EOS> what do you think , yeah ? <EOS> this is <EOS> yeah , well like a cat , you know , soft yeah . <EOS> although <EOS> uh i'll just put there . <EOS> right . <EOS>
yeah , idea . <EOS> but you're <EOS> if you look at the way remote controls are now <EOS> yeah , they're all the same . <EOS> and if you make it look like the ipod <EOS> but i it is it is it is already fancy . because of the lights on the bottom of it . that's already fancy . <EOS> uh maybe maybe make the the mm the wha what's it called uh scroll wheel . make it in in yellow or something . just like the colours of real reaction . <EOS>
i feel like <EOS> does it feel good ? <EOS> uh the shape of it actually does uh . <EOS> and it's i it is very ergonomically designed . <EOS> it's gonna be curved . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> it's gonna be thicker . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> depth . <EOS>
excuse me . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> sure . <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay <EOS> so that's like an okay button , right . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> oh we've discussed how h high it is , but how wide is it ? <EOS> i don't know . <EOS> okay . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> uh one two <EOS> so like three to five centimetres , <EOS> i dunno exactly , but . <EOS> okay . <EOS> so if we use s solar cells , um where is the sun if someone's watching t_v_ inside ? <EOS> s <EOS> uh d doesn't need to be sun . it it's just the daylight , you know . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> right . <EOS> louder , <EOS> tha that should be relatively simple . <EOS> s so <EOS> right . okay . <EOS> o <EOS> y you'd maybe need a code word . <EOS> do you know what i mean ? <EOS> so like when you say change , except that's being said quite a lot on t_v_ , <EOS> so maybe like , you know , remote . <EOS> i mean how often do people say remote on t_v_ ? <EOS> although i only watch charmed , so really i wouldn't know <EOS> but like so you'd just say remote five , you know , remote ten , remote one two nine . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> we have batteries . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> regular . <EOS> okay , <EOS> the case is just a plastic one . <EOS> yeah th yeah , the chip is the the regular one . <EOS> you have the simple one , regular and advanced . <EOS> so it's b should be regular uh the second . <EOS>
right <EOS> w welcome to the the first meeting of uh real reaction's uh um development meetings for our our new television remote control . <EOS> uh this follows our very successful entry into the the consumer market over the last year or so <EOS> um which we want to to build on , <EOS> taking advantage of the uh the the latest developments in in technology and the uh the latest uh uh feelings in in consumer design and and demand <EOS> and uh we want to make this the the very best product th that's possible for everybody , <EOS> uh one that everybody wants , <EOS> uh at a good price for the consumer and at a good price for the company . <EOS> uh and to that end we need all to work together uh to do that . <EOS> um and uh b in no particular order because ev everybody is uh just as vital to this project <EOS> um i'll just go round th the table , <EOS> andrew , marketing , <EOS> um m kendra with the uh um designing the the the user interface <EOS> uh uh and kate with the the industrial design . um . <EOS>
aye right . <EOS> uh-huh . <EOS> okay . <EOS> research i have here is on fashion style , okay , <EOS> which as we've agreed is a priority . <EOS> uh top european fashion trend um that i read about says there's this emerging theme of fruit and vegetables , okay , <EOS> especially in clothes and furniture . <EOS> and when i first saw that i thought hmm , well do we want to actually try and think about this trend and how we add something to it , <EOS> or we get right into it , <EOS> or we completely steer away from it , <EOS> do you know what i mean ? <EOS>
oh <EOS> we probably have to get going , <EOS> don't we ? <EOS> uh-huh . continue with my pres presentation . <EOS> um i've one more slide before we close , <EOS> but in that slide is when we need to make decisions about this these kinds of things , <EOS> so i'll just bring that up and show you all <EOS>
if we had a yellow <EOS> sure . <EOS> oh , <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> alright , so <EOS> i think it it's <EOS> fruity , so fruity . <EOS> so <EOS> it was inspired by the potato , <EOS> so i think it's pretty fruity . <EOS>
you know your job ? <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> good . <EOS>
and the other thing is timing is really gonna be as important as money , <EOS> because if we're gonna sell this thing , i think the best time to sell it is as a christmas present . <EOS> twenty five euros makes a nice little present , <EOS> and we want it to be an impulse purchase , <EOS> we want somebody to see it and think it's , gee i just gotta have that . <EOS> and take out their wallet and buy it . <EOS> so it's gotta be really attractive <EOS> and it <EOS> but it's gotta go to market by september , <EOS> 'cause anything that you don't already have out there in september showing it around , isn't gonna sell for christmas . <EOS> um and then i'll be coming to you as the user interface person to try to tell me from your point of view what are the most friendly features that we could put on it <EOS> and try to prior help me with that prioritising of uh of the features and of the the look and the colour <EOS> and i'll be coming back to you to help weed out those suggestions from that point of view . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> you know , the number of things you buy these days , which you know , have a a a lithium whatever battery in , <EOS> that's uh , you know never needs replacing . <EOS> um perhaps we should have the the disposable remote control , <EOS> uh um you know , <EOS> one some sort of typical usage . <EOS> you know , <EOS> the the the battery will last <EOS>
more likely . <EOS> uh people also complain because they they they all have the same size of the buttons for buttons who w which are not very use <EOS> like f uh memorising channels or or this kind of actions which are not very often <EOS> but they they shouldn't they shouldn't have the same importance in the in the uh in the remote cont in the remote control . <EOS> also the z the design should fit the hand shape . <EOS> so it may be interesting to to think in a in both prototypes , for right and left handed people . <EOS>
uh just a left uh <EOS> okay . <EOS> so um i looked at existing designs <EOS> and also um the information that raj gave us was very useful about what people like , what people dislike . <EOS> um and what people fashionable , because we said people between twenty five and thirty five were the main um buyers of of our t_v_ i think . <EOS> so um what they like and what they find fashionable . <EOS> and ergonomics , <EOS> we said um , <EOS> i don't know i haven't actually been able to do any of this myself , <EOS> but um maybe that comes up , <EOS> i don't know . <EOS> and the findings , well <EOS>
mm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> so , i think this should be a good idea , to put this features . <EOS> and the fourth one was the teletext in various languages . <EOS> we we just have to find a mean how to to add a m a a a microphone or uh well yes a microphone into the the remote control , so <EOS>
yep . <EOS> two . <EOS> number of components you plan to use . <EOS> do i just put quantity being one battery , or <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> but if it's a <EOS> do you wanna go for <EOS> this is where we need to make a final call on if it's a lithium or do we wanna go triple a_s , <EOS> 'cause triple a_s we're gonna have t do more than one battery . <EOS> oh , let's just go for a lithium . <EOS> what do you say ? <EOS> i think uh <EOS> i think the people who purchase this are gonna be technologically <EOS> right . <EOS> okay , down to the electronics um section . <EOS> we're gonna need this kind , correct , if we do the voice sensor , <EOS> so one of those . <EOS>
what's a double curved one ? <EOS> you know , kind of more ergonomic , that kind of suits the palm of your hand , that kind of thing . <EOS> so <EOS> okay . <EOS> um then the case material itself , so it can be uh uh either plastic or latex , uh rubber , wood , or titanium . <EOS> and th for each of them you have uh cases where for example titanium , you can't use it for if you if we're choosing a double curved case , we can't choose titanium . <EOS> and if we are choosing um solar cells then we can't choose latex for the case material , <EOS> so we just have to take that into account . <EOS> but if we're choosing just the flat case then we can go for anything . <EOS> and i think we discussed earlier on the r_ s_ i_ problem thing , so we could uh <EOS>
um personal preferences that i was thinking through <EOS> here's what we've been talking about all through , fashion and simplicity . <EOS> so if we're going for fashion in our cases , i think that what we're gonna wanna look at is a curved or a double-curved case , probably with a variety of design elements . <EOS> maybe titanium , <EOS> maybe some wood . <EOS> we're gonna have to investigate that better when i get specifics of the actual materials , <EOS> but that's sort of what i have in mind . <EOS> and we wanna go for simplicity . <EOS> probably pushbuttons , <EOS> but i'm sort of intrigued by the idea of a scroll scroll wheel , if anyone has anything <EOS>
yeah . yeah . <EOS> alright . <EOS> but i mean it <EOS> do we have any other ideas about that ? <EOS> um <EOS> we could tr <EOS> i don't know . <EOS> think the critical ones came out to be yeah that one . . <EOS> batteries easy to insert for some reason , <EOS> which can be easily <EOS> i think that's not a problem any more . <EOS>
no . no <EOS> no p spec <EOS> it's 'cause we have to find out cost on it . <EOS> do you wanna take an action item to go find out ? <EOS> okay . <EOS> sorry about that . <EOS> um , no that's no problem . <EOS> i'm here for the pushing it after it's made . <EOS> i will market it . <EOS> once we get a price on it then we can market it . <EOS>
yeah , <EOS> but if you u if you do that , you know that you're uh sending a signal . <EOS> and it's you also know which button you p <EOS> no , y yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> but then have to be on the in the all uh remote control have to be leds . <EOS>
there you go . <EOS> wow . <EOS> um right so <EOS> moving on to not fun stuff <EOS> uh project finance . <EOS> um basically <EOS> what we're trying to do is sell this remote for twenty five euros . um . <EOS> this is what the finance department has told me , the c_f_o_ <EOS> but i don't know , <EOS> i'm not sold on this , <EOS> it's pretty dear , <EOS> i mean <EOS> twenty f <EOS> that's like you know forty bucks for a remote . <EOS> it would have to pretty much like do my laundry for me . <EOS> um so <EOS> what <EOS> we can maybe work on that a later <EOS> but we're gonna make a lot on it , <EOS> the profit aims to make fifty million euros on it . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> thank you . <EOS> so <EOS> that brings us to the discussion about our concepts . <EOS> mm . <EOS> 'kay . so <EOS> these are the points we have to discuss . <EOS> um first i think we can talk about the energy source , <EOS> since that's um has a pretty big influence on production price , uh and image . <EOS> uh so <EOS>
uh-huh . <EOS> okay , <EOS> yep , <EOS> right . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> but it's also e e easier to put on versus like mobile covers <EOS> you actually have to screw them on and stuff <EOS> and you kinda sometimes have to get someone to do that for you . <EOS> this is very much you should be able to stretch it over yourself <EOS> and it'll be fine . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> mm . <EOS> did uh did you guys get the email i sent you ? <EOS> oh that's alright . <EOS> i was wondering if that got there okay . <EOS> okay , um so um to s to <EOS> to summarize the teamwork issue , saying that if we could communicate outside the meeting , you know just like quick questions , quick thoughts , whatever , it probably would be bit easier . <EOS>
i did my best . <EOS> not yet . <EOS> and at the end of the day we should have a prototype drawn up . <EOS> uh we have available the smart board and the whiteboard . um <EOS> yeah . <EOS> uh we should take some practice . <EOS> i have some instructions now to do that . <EOS> uh well <EOS> you know how to the documents work . <EOS>
oh no it's it's okay . <EOS> so we kind of want the girlish <EOS> yeah . <EOS> that's included . <EOS> yeah okay . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so the pl the plastic plastic buttons also help uh because of um they are only lit during interaction . so <EOS>
okay . <EOS> just that my method was to look at the , well , my my inspirations , <EOS> which was a big collection of lots of different models of remote controls and other things that use a similar sort of thing , including m_p_ three players , uh like you know , hi-fi remotes , not just television and these things . <EOS>
what's it gonna <EOS> yeah , what's it gonna look like . <EOS> okay . <EOS> i ki i kind of like your idea about the retro phone dial , <EOS> and that the central button could have , maybe our logo on it ? <EOS> um . <EOS> it might be the four way scroll , too . <EOS> i mean if <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
uh yeah . <EOS> i think 'cause if you turn that into a hundred it would be about <EOS> twice that , <EOS> about thirty one . <EOS> about thirty one , <EOS> and then invert that , it's <EOS> so yeah ab well yeah about sixty nine , seventy percent yeah . <EOS>
um gauge our team response to these questions . <EOS> so , <EOS> on a scale of one to seven , one being true and seven being being false . <EOS> seven being a nice round number to work to . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> and then at the end just take an average <EOS>
my turn ? <EOS> okay , <EOS> it's alright . <EOS> participant two ? <EOS> four , <EOS> sorry . <EOS> four . <EOS> four , i think . <EOS> trend , <EOS> yeah . <EOS> no uh <EOS> yes . <EOS> okay , so <EOS> i'm going to talk about trends <EOS> and um i hope this can help us to to understand l how we should design our remote control . <EOS> so , <EOS> next slide please . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> what's up ? <EOS> lefty loosey . <EOS> uh . <EOS> never heard that before , <EOS> that's good . <EOS> oh yes . <EOS> i'll think of that every time now . <EOS> it's gonna stick in your head . <EOS> yeah , that's a good one <EOS> it'll stick with you . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah yeah of course mm . <EOS> th they either these with the uh the the charger any <EOS> in either versions you they they ha they use the same charger yeah . <EOS> with the remote control . <EOS> okay <EOS> so the price of the charger included in the <EOS>
glowingness . <EOS> okay , great . <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> so back to your idea about um incorporating the idea of like fruit and veg , and the corporate colour , and things like that . <EOS> um i mean what does everybody think about <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> uh marketing expert uh have to go to product evaluation . <EOS> okay ? <EOS> i wo what about adding the this word spotting , keyword spotting recognition saying volume up volume down ? <EOS> it's too difficult . <EOS> it's too difficult but people like innovation and that's really uh innovative <EOS> and i don't know if it would cost a lot , just a few five words . <EOS>
okay can we go to the next slide please ? <EOS> alright i i already did a little bit of research after our first meeting where we threw out some ideas <EOS> and it looks to me that within the budget that we're looking at the uh the whole house idea really isn't gonna be possible . <EOS> so i'd like your suggestions to come back to the other slide where i was saying we we could suggest anything . <EOS> i'd like the suggestions to be really specific , so that we'll have a list of things we can cross off , not something like you know whole house control <EOS> what'll be <EOS> and then i found on the internet from from my research that some extended electronic entertainment control should be possible . <EOS> at the budget that we're looking at and at the price point we're looking at , we should be able to make it work the t_v_ , the v_c_r_ , the stereo set um maybe something else cute like a coffee pot or one other appliance or maybe a lamp . <EOS> i have to wind up ? <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> cool . <EOS> oh , the thing we forgot was like a mute button . <EOS> uh no , we we'd not put <EOS> so on on the cover we have the the bare essentials . <EOS> a mute button . <EOS>
yes <EOS> i'm i'm no i'm no i'm not sh sure . <EOS> well <EOS> it's <EOS> you know <EOS> this curve like this so , it's w there is only yes i kno undes i understand what you mean , yes . <EOS> is is is there is nothing like y you know in the other stuff there are yeah concave . <EOS> so i think we can put um <EOS>
okay . <EOS> mm . <EOS> okay . <EOS> oh , this is nothing . <EOS> this is just my notes on what to use . <EOS> and uh my personal preference is yes , i would like also preferably to use r_w_ circuit , <EOS> but from the point of view uh of the design and price , i would stick to i_r_s . <EOS> that's my opinion . <EOS> uh i mean if infra-red uh circuit not not the radio frequency . <EOS>
uh that should be alright , actually . <EOS> ri <EOS> what f_ do you have to press , <EOS> five ? <EOS> eight . <EOS> i just keep pressing lots of 'em . <EOS> well , <EOS> i don't know how relevant all of this gonna be . <EOS> if anything , the that they gave me . <EOS> alright . <EOS>
ah so it's optional with the okay . <EOS> it's an optional . <EOS> it's optional yeah , <EOS> since well according to this study uh people more likes more to have a spongy uh remote control than <EOS> i think it will be i think i <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
oops . <EOS> so , hello everyone . <EOS> we're here to have a kick-off meeting for the design of a f for the beginning of new project um uh remote control for the design for a new remote control . <EOS> i'm the project manager christa pavlov <EOS> and okay let's begin . <EOS>
uh well those instructions will be uh in the email you will receive uh shortly , i hope . <EOS> right . alright . <EOS> me too . <EOS> and of course you have your own uh expertise . <EOS> well uh that was what i had to say . <EOS> uh are there any more questions ? <EOS>
yep . <EOS> yep there we go . <EOS> okay this is uh the working design , <EOS> presented by me , the uh industrial designer extraordinaire . <EOS> 'kay , this is where i went a bit mad with powerpoint so . <EOS> what the first thing question i asked was what are we trying to design ? <EOS> well , a device which basically just sends the signal to the t_v_ to change its state , <EOS> whether that be the power , or the channel um or the volume , everything is just um some sort of signal to change the state of the t_v_ or other appliance that it's sending the signal to . <EOS> um , so i decided i'd have a look at what th other people have designed <EOS> and try and take some inspiration from that . <EOS> but uh although we will want to be taking ideas from other people , we wanna make sure that our design stands out <EOS> and i thought that was something that well it wasn't really my area <EOS> because
uh you should explain uh with different colours and with different pen widths . and you should explain why you draw that particular animal . <EOS> so , <EOS> julian . <EOS> okay . <EOS> don't take up too much space . <EOS> um yeah . <EOS> different pen widths , how do you do that ? <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah , uh <EOS> and for all the person of the family maybe , <EOS> so , <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> if if if if you're if you ar if you already have a product it works one hundred percent reliable , would you replace it with another one ? <EOS>
yeah yeah yeah yeah . <EOS> so the scroll wheel , in or out ? <EOS> mm pr my personal preference is out . <EOS> i don't think the cost is justified for a little bit more uniqueness when we already have that , <EOS> and i don't s think it's obvious and natural how it would be used . <EOS>
yeah . maybe something like that . <EOS> or using the names and the keyboard <EOS> i dunno . <EOS> ah yeah . <EOS> uh . <EOS> or <EOS> maybe <EOS> oh i don't know . <EOS> or something . <EOS> oh . <EOS> maybe we could have key buttons , like uh discovery channe like documentary channel , and movies channel and <EOS>
uh but uh they found out the most important aspect for remote controls happens to be a fancy look-and-feel , instead of the current functional look and feel . <EOS> so it's very important for us to create something new . <EOS> so <EOS> what michael just said , <EOS> it must be uh some very different from ordinary uh remote controls . <EOS> fancy stands for an original look-and-feel of the case and interface . <EOS> uh this uh aspect is the most important one . <EOS> uh it came out of the research . <EOS> it uh is twice important as the following . <EOS> the second uh most important aspect is that a remote control should it uh technological innovative . <EOS> uh that stands for uh uh new technical uh features . <EOS> and then uh that uh this is a point of discussion , <EOS> because we just decided that we don't make use of uh l_c_d_ or uh speech recognition . <EOS>
single . <EOS> this one is <EOS> oh <EOS> the the <EOS> it's not going to work uh people . <EOS> we have rubber . <EOS> this one is curved like this , <EOS> right . <EOS> it's curved like this . <EOS> i'll just fill it in . <EOS> no no no , <EOS> single curved is like this . <EOS> uh that's the only curve you made , <EOS> not th uh curved like that . <EOS> that's uh <EOS>
so we can now um <EOS> we can now have a little look at the the excel sheet and price listing , <EOS> and see if we need to <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> um if we need to rethink anything at all . <EOS> so um <EOS> for this first part here power-wise , have we got battery ? <EOS> do we have kinetic as well ? <EOS> no . <EOS> okay , <EOS> just battery . <EOS>
and how did you feel about the whole the whole process though ? <EOS> oh , overall i mean i thought we did a good job like <EOS> we got to choose basically we had control over <EOS> minus it being just merely a t_v_ remote we got to choose what we wanted to do with it . <EOS>
but when you are left-handed , that's that's a problem . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> uh yeah . yeah of course . <EOS> yeah then w then you would have to to make it like this . <EOS> like like you drew here . <EOS> maybe can design two versions . <EOS>
no . <EOS> yeah , that's right , <EOS> it <EOS> but you actually got to write on the paper . <EOS> you really got to write on that paper . <EOS> sorry ? <EOS> yeah , <EOS> i know , <EOS> but i d i i thought it would be just in in in uh typed words in word , <EOS> so that's not <EOS> just <EOS> it's just a picture . <EOS> so <EOS> it's not that cool as i th thought it would be . <EOS>
yeah , <EOS> bring to <EOS> i gotta bring it home . <EOS> to my exave executive <EOS> my executive uh big room with the with the panting . <EOS> a big office . <EOS> yes . <EOS> aye . yeah . okay . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> okay . <EOS> the next item is evaluation . <EOS> no , okay . <EOS> uh if that's <EOS> if you're finished . <EOS> um <EOS> uh yeah , we're finished . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> shall i take your uh power ? <EOS> oh sorry . <EOS>
d do we have actually any concept of what the difference is between a simple chip and an advanced chip ? <EOS> yes <EOS> the difference is , with a simple chip a simple chip will operate <EOS> oh why doesn't this scroll up ? <EOS> previous previous , okay . <EOS> a simple chip is required to operate push buttons . <EOS> um an advanced chip is required to to operate um the l_c_d_ display , <EOS> and it didn't say specifically , but i i have a hunch that a regular chip is gonna be the scroll wheel and the multiple scroll wheels . <EOS>
and there is a <EOS> like <EOS> i would say three . or maybe four . <EOS> okay . <EOS> well <EOS> we have reduced the keys actually you see . <EOS> three is fine with me . <EOS> consensus ? three or four ? <EOS> three , i would . three . <EOS>
yeah , <EOS> uh uh <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah , i i mean <EOS> th th this needs going t into the technology a bit . <EOS> i mean the the actual time that a remote control is actually operating <EOS> mm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> i would think is i is is probably , you know , no more than minutes in its entire life . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> and that's it . <EOS> look at look at this one . <EOS> in fact <EOS> oh <EOS> that's really nice . <EOS> almost impossible to misplace or l or lose . <EOS> might take up your whole living room . <EOS> uh just something else i need to bring to your attention <EOS> is have you have you seen these on a remote ? <EOS> this is actually the volume up and down , <EOS> but they both say v_ on them , <EOS> which , when you first look at it , you expect that to be the down , <EOS> because it looks like a downward pointing arrow , <EOS> but it's actually the v_ to indicate that it's the volume , <EOS>
i've used kinetic in terms of watches <EOS> and it's very very uh handy , <EOS> you don't even notice um that it's there . <EOS> it sounds great . <EOS> i've never come across it before , <EOS> but it sounds fantastic . <EOS> sounds like it could be g a really good economical <EOS> it would make the whole thing a lot lighter , more convenient . <EOS>
i only have three , i just have like our three . yeah . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> that's what i have as well , r rose <EOS> so . <EOS> okay . <EOS> you don't have mine ? <EOS> no , <EOS> but that's 'cause i think yours is in the e-mail separate , <EOS> like it's not on the server . <EOS>
mm uh <EOS> oh <EOS> i got an email uh <EOS> and it says uh the chip can be uh simple , regular or advanced . <EOS> and um <EOS> they say uh a display requires an advanced chip . <EOS> and this is more expensive than all the other chips . <EOS> so <EOS> it's m the most expensive . <EOS>
i don't think you should be able to mould it , <EOS> but <EOS> or <EOS> no . <EOS> or or wh <EOS> what's something harder . <EOS> no no no <EOS> but but you have to <EOS> like like like a a eraser or something . that's the bit you can press it in , <EOS> or something harder . <EOS>
well the the problem with that is we may end up with a whole bunch of inventory of a of a poor design you know . so <EOS> yep one over another . <EOS> yeah , okay , i hear that . <EOS> yeah , complicated but <EOS> um but what we could do is some kind of <EOS> well i mean <EOS> yeah we we need to , i mean , have a few designs to look at <EOS> and then come up with something that i think we all agree is , you know , the best fit . <EOS> i think w what's really important is it has to look good , <EOS> it has to feel it has to feel good in your hand , <EOS> it has to be durable , <EOS> it has to a and i think it's really important that it doesn't look cheap . <EOS> i think i think we have to make sure people look at it an and feel like it its like a quality remote . even though the cost may be low . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> it's <EOS> there's something to be said , i mean we we got that thing earlier from you about um not wanting it to r_ r_ repetitive stress injuries and things <EOS> and and <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> something grippable , <EOS> i mean we don't we don't we don't wanna go spongy , maybe . <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
alright , okay . <EOS> alright , okay . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> bu <EOS> yeah but um on on that again i just thought 'cause you can get those key chains now and you whistle and then it'll let off a loud noise to let you know where it is <EOS> so i thought that could be quite a <EOS>
you can have an l_c_d_ screen . <EOS> um but therefore no rubber will be used . <EOS> alright ? <EOS> so plastic yes , titanium yes , but this will of course influence the form . <EOS> with plastic , as i understand it , you can use any form . <EOS> um latex <EOS>
yeah , then it's <EOS> yeah yeah yeah . definitely . <EOS> no flipping or <EOS> you wanted the flipping so <EOS> no flipping ? <EOS> yeah i guess <EOS> but uh i mean most votes count right ? <EOS> but if you if you <EOS> if you drop it it it just breaks . <EOS> and it has to be very strong because of the . yeah kind of <EOS>
right yeah . yeah . <EOS> mm . course . <EOS> um uh my personal preference is that we make some adjustment in the cost , either lower <EOS> or develop an integrated new technol technology . <EOS> that's that is the next step , <EOS> there's technology and then there is technology , which we're moving into the next phase . <EOS>
in the beginning , yeah . <EOS> probably would have <EOS> mean we could have come up with a lot more solid design in the end , <EOS> i would have to agree . <EOS> it is very much a pity to um get so far into the stage and then find out that maybe some of your ideas are just a bit too expensive . <EOS> always hard to tell until you know the costs . um . <EOS>
and uh are we gonna have it il being illuminated from inside onto the buttons or <EOS> um the that i mean that's <EOS> no , <EOS> because we've got so few buttons <EOS> that it that actually makes that redundant . <EOS> yeah , i think so too . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> and especially for making them so like different and <EOS>
yeah , <EOS> and so that's where the difficulties lie . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> but <EOS> yeah , <EOS> this <EOS> so that's the thing you have to weigh against each other . <EOS> do we want to use a few options and might not be so or original , or uh multi-purpose as we thought , <EOS> or do we want to use um many buttons . <EOS> so um <EOS> weighing those factors . <EOS>
um now you can all give your presentations . <EOS> we can talk about the requirements <EOS> and hopefully come to some decisions . <EOS> right , forty minutes for this meeting , <EOS> so a bit more time than the last one . <EOS> here's the additional points <EOS> i just wanted to put those in there to see if you guys had any comments on them . <EOS> uh did you all receive that email ? <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> it's not so bad <EOS> so . <EOS> the only thing i can draw , <EOS> because it's very simple . <EOS> okay . <EOS> i go . <EOS> what ? <EOS> oh . <EOS> so what else ? <EOS> this was my favourite one , <EOS> but <EOS>
mm . <EOS> mm mm mm mm mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> 'cause sometimes <EOS> look at this computer , th this laptop , it's all black , <EOS> and uh it's quite conventional , <EOS> and sometimes people don't like too much flashy colours like this one presented here . <EOS> so maybe we could do like in the range the set of what we propose a black one , very standard one , that meets the the requirements of th such people that want really standard uh things . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> ju just a thought . <EOS> you could simply have a slightly ovoid shaped joystick <EOS> that could then just be turn uh twisted round , <EOS> so that the uh sticky uh so that the bit that sticks out a bit more is on one side or the other . <EOS> but as you as you see with the uh with holding it in the left hand , the l_ uh the l_c_d_ is nowhere useful , <EOS> so that would need to be articulated uh if we're going to retain ergonomic design . <EOS> um now <EOS> i i got your note about uh keeping the cost down . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> well yeah <EOS> these , i think , we can <EOS> so we talked about the layout in my presentation <EOS> and what i didn't mention yet really is is the sort of like the ergonomic design . <EOS> i t i think we can make big improvements over these two that you see here , i mean . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm , <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah , yeah . <EOS> and i guess that point about the room not being r very friendly to that , i think that's a very big thing , <EOS> and i think the fact that we're wearing these things restricts <EOS> i feel it 'cause i wear m my glasses , right , and that but that irritates me right <EOS> it it it does actually you know affect how , w whether you feel comfortable to communicate . <EOS> i feel like i'm hiding behind the equipment , rather than the equipment is helping me , and you know . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> a recharger maybe . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> we have to make sure to uh <EOS> yeah okay . <EOS> yeah <EOS> but <EOS> we still want to have a recharger , don't we ? <EOS> is that still the <EOS> yes . yes . <EOS>
. <EOS> okay , that's it . <EOS> thank you . <EOS> okay um i'll do some <EOS> i'll rub the features <EOS> and let the drawing stay . <EOS> 'kay <EOS> um my name is gaurav . <EOS> um <EOS> my favourite animal <EOS> one of my favourite animals is a cow . <EOS> i've got no idea how to draw a cow . <EOS>
yes . <EOS> yes , indeed . <EOS> so uh well <EOS> i think w when we are working on the international market , uh in principle it has enough customers <EOS> uh so <EOS> when we have a good product we uh we could uh meet this this aim , i think . <EOS>
mm mm mm . next . <EOS> . <EOS> alright so <EOS> i thought a little bit about the interface . uh how it should look . <EOS> and uh uh we uh determined that will not be no buttons , but only an l_c_d_ screen , <EOS> so i had to uh look on that . <EOS> and the design is therefore based on what we just uh uh thought of . <EOS>
yeah , yeah mm . <EOS> ecologists , <EOS> yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah , yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> alrigh <EOS> in fact , having them both will <EOS> if we want to have battery , regular battery and and the solar energy battery it could be it'll it will add a little bit of the price , <EOS> but it will be an added value also <EOS> that will be compensated , <EOS> so hmm . <EOS>
i will go . that's fine . <EOS> very good . <EOS> alright . so <EOS> this one here , right ? <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> okay . very nice . <EOS> alright . <EOS> my favourite animal is like <EOS> a beagle . <EOS> um <EOS> charac favourite characteristics of it ? is that right ? <EOS> uh , right , well basically um high priority for any animal for me is that they be willing to take a lot of physical affection from their family . <EOS> and , yeah that they have lots of personality <EOS> and uh be fit and in robust good health . <EOS> so this is blue . <EOS> blue beagle . <EOS> my family's beagle . <EOS>
hmm . <EOS> so <EOS> each person in turn , i'd like us to go up to the whiteboard , <EOS> the pen's just underneath it there <EOS> and draw your favourite animal <EOS> and then tell everyone what the f your favourite characteristics of that animal are <EOS> and while you're doing that tell us your name , what your role is and perhaps how your animal relates to the role that you're taking in this project . <EOS>
industrial designer , yeah . <EOS> industrial designer . <EOS> component component , yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> and florent to work my subject . <EOS> and so specific instructions will be sent to you by your personal coach . <EOS> yep . <EOS> okay . <EOS> it's okay ? <EOS> i think the um session is closed . <EOS>
yeah , you can have the number going around in the corner . <EOS> yeah . okay . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay so we have this like scrolling sort of button . <EOS> oh that's gonna <EOS> is that like on on a mouse pad where like kind of <EOS> okay . <EOS>
and even possibly a timer to so that people can program their favourite uh uh program on th right from the remote . <EOS> yes . <EOS> uh are we all in agreement that that's about what we discussed last time ? <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yes . <EOS>
mm mm mm . keep k keep in mind i it's a it's a twenty five euro unit , <EOS> so uh uh the the very fancy stuff uh w we can leave that out , i think . <EOS> so <EOS> twenty five euro you expect a quite , well normal but good functioning user friendly remote control . <EOS>
contrast contra well . <EOS> yeah , no th the material's cheap but it's just uh the the glow in the dark material needs some light to charge it you know , <EOS> and then uh if you're , if you're sitting in the dark for too long it uh it won't glow any more . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> so i think if it's so then it's cool ? <EOS> so , i dunno what you think , bob , <EOS> but it would be great for users i think , and very good for marketing . <EOS> i think for sure . definitely . the softer the better . <EOS>
this is the one that i made . <EOS> uh-huh . <EOS> it is uh curved , easy to hold , hand-held , nice and small with big easy buttons . <EOS> this is like a scroll , <EOS> but they are push buttons <EOS> and they enter takes you into the different menus . <EOS> of course we need someone who's experienced with the television . <EOS> i mean this is the infrared thing <EOS> that's gonna zap at the television . <EOS> uh i'm not quite sure how to make that , <EOS> but i'm sure it will work . <EOS> uh this is on off switch , <EOS> 'cause i think we do need that , <EOS> and i think it gives it a nice balance . <EOS> and it's gonna have the logo imprinted on it uh in there . <EOS> um as for what it's actually made of <EOS> well <EOS> the function of these buttons is up , down , left and right in the different menus . <EOS>
you don't feel free to answer this ? <EOS> no . <EOS> maybe you can make <EOS> uh uh mm <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay , so <EOS> thank you . <EOS> see you . <EOS>
uh i yeah , <EOS> just a simple experience . <EOS> i uh i prefer um remote control working with radio waves , <EOS> because remote control working with infra-red rays you should you should you should keep it in a specific direction and then try it hard to tune . <EOS>
so <EOS> uh this for toolbar . you see it next . um <EOS> we have a pen . <EOS> and we can use this pen to perform . <EOS> yes . <EOS> so <EOS> operations . <EOS> it doesn't always work . <EOS> yes . <EOS> okay so <EOS> you can
now is would this be considered just a standard uh um <EOS> i think any des <EOS> this is not this is not cutting edge technology we're talking here . <EOS> we're talking about existing technology . <EOS> nothing is being modified or upgraded or new discoveries . <EOS> no . <EOS> right <EOS> i think <EOS> yeah <EOS> this is just this is just a basic layout of ev of all the components that w w are gonna be absolutely necessary f to have a working remote . <EOS> we can add things in like if we wanted some voice recognition , <EOS> i mean that i mean that you can kinda say would would fall under the user interface and the digital signal processing chip . <EOS> but
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm . <EOS> at uh yeah . <EOS> i forgot to tell you there is only a single button there , <EOS> b this button <EOS> yeah alright . <EOS> this button is like the mouse is like a joystick , <EOS> you can move in three hundred and sixty degrees of direction <EOS> so you can make a turn <EOS> and it the additi functions associated to all the actions <EOS> you ma you have a click you have a double click all in a single button . <EOS>
doing that . no , <EOS> it's okay , you uh cut the l_c_d_ screen <EOS> and introduce two more buttons . <EOS> just <EOS> okay . so <EOS> l_c_d_'s out , <EOS> is speech rec out now ? <EOS> we've <EOS> the speech recognition is out . yep . <EOS>
okay , the the yellow banana like thing is i think is okay . <EOS> si <EOS> it's got a curve to it . <EOS> right <EOS> five . <EOS> is that sound reasonable ? <EOS> am i <EOS> do you think i'm stretching the uh the use of the banana ? <EOS>
uh o okay . <EOS> okay , so . <EOS> um can you put all these reports in the project documents folder if they're not already in there as well . <EOS> so , it just helps me summarize them . <EOS> and um i'll put any <EOS> i'm i'm putting anything i do in there anyway , <EOS> so uh <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> yep . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yep . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> um <EOS> what else <EOS> uh any wh i do <EOS> i'm not really sure what they're looking for when they say new ideas found . <EOS> um i don't know is <EOS> could you think of like anything else that would have been helpful today at all ? <EOS>
mm-hmm <EOS> but uh do you already have like a functional design or a technical design or <EOS> uh for the moment not yet . <EOS> oh for the moment not yet , okay , <EOS> but uh what's what's your uh <EOS> do you have some project plan , something with you or <EOS>
so <EOS> that's something we have to decide on . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> we have to keep it simple . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> we have to decide this this lecture , or this this this uh fifty minutes , yeah , how it is gonna look . <EOS> what we're gonna do . <EOS> okay . <EOS>
from their <EOS> i'll just use it from their website . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> okay ? <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> right . <EOS> thank you . <EOS>
i don't think it would come through a sentence in a television . <EOS> if somebody's speaking on the se the television , they're not gonna stop and say remote , <EOS> okay . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> so i think that uh something could be designed to recognise single word <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> s s we could we could make it dual function voice recognition and still have buttons on it um <EOS> 'cause we're <EOS> oh , we could , yeah . <EOS> we c <EOS> yeah , <EOS> we could even have it as like a yeah the buttons control this <EOS> and the voice functions control the f things that you would do all the time , <EOS> so . <EOS>
um we are really gonna sell this . <EOS> ta-da . <EOS> for something that looks cool and also has what i want it to b do technologically . <EOS> and that's your right brain taking over , w wanting the artistic , the fashionable , the hip , you know . <EOS> if we all just went out and bought useful things , i don't think i mean that's not what technology . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> spongy . <EOS> i i only speak for myself though . <EOS> and i'd never heard of the kinetic energy before , <EOS> so . <EOS> good work as a design team , <EOS> because we <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , i think we're a good team actually . <EOS> i'm not sure all the wires are really great though . <EOS>
good . <EOS> that we know what we're going to make uh th what the product is going to like look like . <EOS> uh first i have the notes of the last meeting , <EOS> so i showed uh show them to you . <EOS> oh , sorry about that , <EOS> i just escape this one . <EOS> how do i escape this ? <EOS>
yeah i like also this one . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> the point is w <EOS> maybe we need to also to make a decision on how how how big we want to be <EOS> and how many buttons like n we should dec decide numbers or <EOS> yeah , mm . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> and i maybe you will transform it . <EOS> i i think the user the user interface design is he will design how the user will you know the relation between the user and you know the remote control so <EOS> use it . <EOS> make make <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
we've been giving simple questionnaires in different areas <EOS> because th obviously we have to see what the com consumers are looking for today , <EOS> 'cause uh trends change very very quickly . <EOS> in six months maybe this idea is already gone out the window , so it's gonna be a question how fast we can act . <EOS> uh they already erased the rest of mine , huh . <EOS>
i thought they would give an option of flat buttons or a <EOS> you <EOS> you see , you can still get it does you still get repetitive strain injury , whether you are pressing a button or pressing a flat bit of screen . <EOS> it's the v it's the fact that you are pressing the same doing the same movement . <EOS> it's not actually what you are doing . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> quite disposable . <EOS> okay . <EOS> oh okay . <EOS> alright , okay . <EOS> uh-huh . <EOS> okay . <EOS> fashion . <EOS> cool . <EOS> mm 'kay . <EOS> fruit and veg , well there you go . <EOS> just what i think of when i think of a remote control . <EOS>
yeah , <EOS> you wanna navigate the channels quickly i guess . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm . <EOS> um takes too much time to learn how to use a new remote . <EOS> i think especially for uh the older generation . <EOS> i know my grandmother doesn't like mobile phones , <EOS> takes ages to work how to use . <EOS> anyway um <EOS> and they also remotes often get lost in the room , so nobody can find them . <EOS> so maybe tracking devices is a good idea . <EOS> um personal preferences . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> here is a simple tool bar . <EOS> it's what i just said , <EOS> it's save , print , move back or forward one page . <EOS> you can switch between the different drawings . <EOS> and then we're going to try out the white board . <EOS>
no ? <EOS> components ? <EOS> yes sure . <EOS> so there is a_s_r_ decoder which could be there , <EOS> and then there could be another scroll button scroll scroller , <EOS> and then there could be buttons , <EOS> and all of them they will just do the decoding and put it in the math put it in the proper message format . <EOS> and then there is there is the chip which is sitting , the green one , <EOS> and it converts it into bit codes , and that bit codes are sent by the infrared device to the receiver . <EOS>
yeah 'cause that's . <EOS> and so uh we're gonna have some new technology to enhance the marketability . <EOS> yeah uh again i'm not sold on the product <EOS> because we don't have a product in my opinion yet . <EOS> mm . <EOS> so i need a product . <EOS> i need a product to market . <EOS> and i just whatever product you guys put together , we'll find a way to market it . <EOS> tha that i'm not concerned with . <EOS>
might be <EOS> but it and it's something that they will be experiencing in a lot of different places soon . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so , should we maybe say f a five <EOS> and say it is intuitive , <EOS> but it's different , <EOS> so , do you know , i mean it's obvious how to use it , <EOS> but you might have to think about it first . <EOS> so we give that one a five , you think ? <EOS> yep . <EOS>
no . <EOS> and besides that , they're not very critical <EOS> so <EOS> i mean they don't really care what the remote control is like . <EOS> they'll just pretty much take the first thing they see and which looks acceptable . <EOS> but don't you think that if we make a remote which is uh typically made for this market , that people think the people think that's the the device i've looked for although i didn't realise it . <EOS> so <EOS> let's try it . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> slightly curved , curved . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> g uh so what happens is you don't have to press your thumb too down like . <EOS> so it's already curled up so your thumb doesn't <EOS> y yeah <EOS> so we can have a s like you know moulded according to your <EOS>
'cause this is you were using it o upside down . <EOS> still that <EOS> that's our boss . <EOS> nah , i'm i'm not convinced of that at all . <EOS> i've been wor i've been wondering about that all day , <EOS> but see these look like they're <EOS> that looks the oth that looks like it would be that way around , <EOS> but it feels more comfortable , wh what you call upside-down . <EOS> i don't care . <EOS> uh okay so that data might be slightly invalid . <EOS> what new ideas have we found ? <EOS>
why ? <EOS> it'll tell you when you flip the channel on the t_v_ . <EOS> yeah the the television can tell you . <EOS> can . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> oh yeah yeah no i see what you're talking about . <EOS> yeah that's kinda cool . <EOS> how would you program it though ? <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> okay <EOS> and if you disable speech recognition system then ? <EOS> so <EOS> w w i'll i'll come to that point later on . <EOS> mm hmm hmm hmm hmm hmm . <EOS> so norman will explain to you . <EOS> and we will we will serve the charger with this ? <EOS>
could they be smelly ? <EOS> i is it supposed to be shaped like a vegetable ? uh like uh i dunno , like uh carrots or something . <EOS> oh god . <EOS> i don't know . <EOS> or carrot shaped , <EOS> mm . <EOS> maybe , <EOS> or <EOS>
okay . <EOS> yeah , that's true . <EOS> alrighty . <EOS> i feel like a robot . <EOS> okay . um , <EOS> well i guess i had the most time to think about it . <EOS> i'm going to draw a butterfly , <EOS> because i saw a butterfly yesterday , that seemed to be like the symbol of spring arriving . <EOS> and it was actually the prettiest butterfly i've ever seen out in the wild , <EOS> and i though that was pretty cool in scotland . <EOS> it was like , well it was a little pointier than that . <EOS>
um , okay so we've got battery . <EOS> the inside components is pretty standardised across the board isn't it ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so there's not a really a decision to be made there , um . <EOS> the buttons <EOS> what did you give us as our <EOS> the bare-board l_c_d_ or <EOS>
yeah , <EOS> but the <EOS> yeah but yeah <EOS> but the same can happen even with it you know this kind of remote control <EOS> because the <EOS> yeah , <EOS> it's very interesting . <EOS> yeah <EOS> but this <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i don't think it <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> oh okay , yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> okay , <EOS> so we we could p what we could probably do is to keep also to keep uh keep the l_c_d_ and all the buttons and stuff , <EOS> we could make it like a opening opening style that if you open it you are you just turn on the t_v_ and if you close it , it will <EOS>
especially when it's made of soft rubber like this . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> you understand ? <EOS> yeah , i understand . <EOS> yeah <EOS> i would think about colours like uh red , yellow , green , blue , <EOS> just <EOS> yeah o of course . <EOS> the fruity colours and the autumn colours , like red and brown , dark red and brown . <EOS>
as i say it only specified that we need a more advanced circuit board for the scroll wheel , <EOS> it didn't <EOS> the voice recognition came as a separate piece of information . um . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> no <EOS> the scroll wheel required the regular , <EOS> so the <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> some of tho <EOS> anybody see anything that they liked in these ones ? <EOS> well , some of those buttons though are blue-based . <EOS> um well , a lot of those buttons are blue-based . <EOS> well , kind of . <EOS> um and then if v we do have them illuminate upon contact , they could illuminate yellow . <EOS> like if we <EOS> like the one all the way on the left , <EOS> uh you ca you can see it on your computer better . <EOS> um where the button is actually blue , but the number itself is clear or white or whatever so if you pressed it would illuminate yellow . <EOS> so we'd have blue and yellow for the touch buttons . <EOS>
so <EOS> yeah . <EOS> no n not specifically . <EOS> more to how to get them <EOS> and <EOS> no ? <EOS> i got some uh requirements <EOS> it has uh it has to be user-friendly . <EOS> uh really easy to use buttons , <EOS> not not uh very small buttons , <EOS> but not the the also the big big buttons , <EOS> but just normal buttons . <EOS> it has to be a small unit . <EOS> it has to be uh <EOS> yeah , <EOS> you can take it with you uh everywhere in in your house . <EOS> so it has n has not to be l yeah , gigantic uh machine . <EOS>
too wicked . <EOS> mm . <EOS> a minute please , <EOS> my uh laptop is uh <EOS> oh , <EOS> there it is , <EOS> thank you . <EOS> so <EOS> welcome back . at the functional design meeting um <EOS> the plan is uh that uh each one of you , so not me but only you uh will uh present uh the the things you worked on uh the last uh half hour . <EOS> i will uh take minutes <EOS> and will put uh the minutes that i have uh at the end of the session in the shared folder . <EOS> also the minutes of the previous session are also in the shared folder now , <EOS> so you can read that uh now or afterwards . um <EOS> uh i had an email from the from the management board <EOS> uh , i don't know if you a al also uh received it , <EOS> but there were four points <EOS> uh which uh i think are very important . <EOS> first one is uh they think that uh teletext teletext becomes outdated <EOS> uh and internet will be the the main uh focus . <EOS> uh second one is also important <EOS> uh , because it's one of the discussion points of the previous session . <EOS> uh the remote control shou should onl only be used for the television , <EOS> so it uh not gonna it's not gonna be a multi-purpose remote control , <EOS> so uh that's one thing to keep in mind . <EOS>
a speaker and uh <EOS> indeed . <EOS> but if that's better than language for the for the remote . <EOS> yeah , yeah yeah yeah <EOS> . yeah . <EOS> so we want to uh yeah it's international uh okay . <EOS> then it's yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS>
yeah because th th the evaluation project <EOS> which is different . which is different . <EOS> none of us will buy it . <EOS> no it's people in in in milan and uh in paris that are gonna buy it . <EOS> we're n <EOS> yeah . <EOS> we're not in milan or paris . <EOS>
right . <EOS> what size battery and <EOS> well , the other thing is like even if it's got a few buttons , so we want it to be bigger than this , <EOS> 'cause it still fits in your hand , so you still wanted something that's comfortable and substantial , but not necessarily full of buttons . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> bu but even even in the case of twenty five to thirty five it's quite popular , right ? <EOS> so mm uh are are are <EOS> yeah , i d well we've we've got quite a d decent t_v_ . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> we're still <EOS> yeah . <EOS> or w maybe we can just kind of uh uh <EOS>
just <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm , mm . <EOS> it's quite <EOS> what do you guys think of the pens ? <EOS> it asks about that . <EOS> they're pretty cool . <EOS> they're kinda hard to write with though . <EOS> mm . <EOS> i wanna s <EOS> yeah <EOS> and i i've f forgotten once or twice to check the box . <EOS>
put fashion in electronics . <EOS> absolutely . <EOS> the carrot banana remote . <EOS> yeah , isn't it fashionable ? <EOS> yeah , sure . <EOS> it's the maximum fashion . <EOS> fruit fruit and vegetables are fashionable these days , so . <EOS> so , we give it seven , <EOS> and we write <EOS>
very big success . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> uh . i think so as well . <EOS> mm . <EOS> change our focus on the project , <EOS> and i think we can uh we can sell this . <EOS> uh i simply think um <EOS> uh that the new products we are gonna make , uh spef specifically design , are designed for uh younger people , <EOS> uh so maybe we can focus ourself on the elderly people . <EOS> and i think we have to um see what requirements we need for those um remote controls . <EOS> 'cause what you told is the channel selection is important . volume selection , power and teletext . <EOS> okay . um <EOS>
mm-hmm . mm-hmm . <EOS> um obviously into the design , while also making it quite different from anything else that's there . <EOS> we could look in at that <EOS> i mean look at the mobile . <EOS> but mm . what we were talking is to make it more rather than like sea-shells , <EOS> logo could become as <EOS> you could put a logo in the corner of uh the model , <EOS> rather than you know , trying to make it like a sea shell or whatever you were ta telling like . <EOS>
i don't know . so <EOS> are there any fruits that look like broccoli , no ? <EOS> uh . <EOS> not that i can think of . <EOS> rhubarb . <EOS> i think that broccoli is my favourite actually . <EOS> uh despite the <EOS> rhubarb . <EOS> these obscure fruits . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> i think we did well . <EOS> i think ya' did . <EOS> did you work well together in there , and <EOS> 'kay . <EOS> yep . <EOS> well , no , there was there was scratching and fighting , but no . <EOS> minus that one fight . <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
no . <EOS> no . <EOS> so . <EOS> so <EOS> i think it would be very hard to actually gain on the competition here . <EOS> 'kay . <EOS> so <EOS> we can <EOS> that would that would cost a a big marketing expedition <EOS> yeah . that's right . <EOS>
colours were under format <EOS> right ? <EOS> let's see . <EOS> how am i gonna do this ? um <EOS> makes new paper . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> orange . <EOS> mm uh . <EOS> a rabbit i think . <EOS> kangaroo . <EOS> kangaroo . <EOS> not quite actually . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> mm . just the casing . <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> back to the uh the cost the material . <EOS> we have to ask whether we're going to include a certain number of face plates with the package ? <EOS> that's something i w for <EOS> say we're including three or four face plates , it's gonna drive the cost up . <EOS> and the other question is , if we do include them are we really in a position to evaluate that market ? <EOS> we haven't done any tests on face plates and whether <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> cool . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> honestly speaking , i cannot imagine it , so far , <EOS> but it will be terrible . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> um . <EOS> mm . <EOS> and setting buttons hidden in . <EOS> mm , other remarks , or something , or . <EOS> something we didn't talk about yes yet , or . <EOS> i think we are almost there . <EOS> uh maybe , how can we , if we have a soft thing , like this , and to open it we have to attach it somewhere , i dunno how to do that technically , or . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> like a rubber sleeve almost , yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> something like <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm . <EOS> alright . <EOS> that could be a good idea . <EOS> mm . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> it could <EOS> it would be comfortable to hold on also . <EOS>
yeah . awesome . awesome . <EOS> well the thing is , if it was had an alarm system , <EOS> i mean , when it when it lights up as we i mean it could light up when the alarm went . <EOS> but if it was hidden underneath the cushion or something , there wouldn't be any point . <EOS> so you can't see the alarm , but it would light up . <EOS>
hmm . <EOS> it seems also like with the speech recognition , yeah , it's a great feature , <EOS> but if you're watching t_v_ , there's a lot of ambient sound , <EOS> and it's words . <EOS> it's not just , you know , noises like something hitting . <EOS> it's actual speech , <EOS> so then you have to make sure that the speech recognizer is good enough to filter out the t_v_ speech , and the the user's speech . <EOS> otherwise , you can say remote . <EOS> but if someone on the screen is saying the same thing , all of a sudden , you have someone in a movie saying off and your screen dies , <EOS>
um we have <EOS> we'll discuss that <EOS> and then i just wanna mention some new project requirements that came in . <EOS> um , teletext is apparently outdated , so due to internet popularity , so that's off the list . um , <EOS> also our remote should be used only for television , um , <EOS> no extra internet kinda fancy things , just the remote and the television . <EOS> um and also we need to incorporate our corporate image onto this , <EOS> so um the phrase is , we put fashion in electronics , <EOS> so let's be fashionable i guess . <EOS> um if we have something <EOS> i mean silver and and gold or yellow are our colours , <EOS> so if we had a like a kind of silver one like you saw , and yellow writing , something like that . <EOS>
yeah , <EOS> but those are more fancy functions , not not really many features or something . <EOS> right , <EOS> that that that <EOS> those are features . <EOS> no . <EOS> it has relatively few features , <EOS> with <EOS> it's three features , basically , <EOS> the l_c_d_ touch screen is feature . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> some things . <EOS> then we did some research to the most relevant functions . <EOS> channel selection and volume selection um both got a ten on a scale of one to ten for relevancy . <EOS> the power button got a nine . <EOS> and teletext got a six and a half . <EOS> so these are the most most uh important functions on a remote control . <EOS> then there are some one-time use function . <EOS> that's what i like to call them . <EOS> that uh audio settings , video settings , and channel settings buttons . <EOS> which are not really used very frequently , <EOS> but are still considered to be of some importance . <EOS> um channel selection was also indicated to be used very frequently . one hundred and sixty eight times per hour . <EOS>
well <EOS> don't we need plastic , and <EOS> provided , okay . <EOS> the wood ? <EOS> oh , <EOS> i guess it was rubber rather than latex . <EOS> i mean the rubber . <EOS> it was rubber and special colour , <EOS> right ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
yeah , press them . <EOS> and then w be patient . <EOS> yeah , here we go . <EOS> tada . <EOS> and if you want it to go into slide show mode , it's that little button there . <EOS> can i not just uh do each one in order ? <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> okay . <EOS> so want something that looks good and is easy to use , <EOS> big priorities . <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> so you know just c looking at what what craig um craig's i uh ideas are s sorta tell me that maybe what we wanna do is try and um separate the different things that we wanna include in this . <EOS> so if we do say well we want there to be all the technology will we try and make that almost be like optional technology . <EOS> you know , it's like like i find a lot of t_v_s these days , something really like about 'em is if you wanna just turn 'em on and off you can , <EOS> but they have little panels where you click and there's just like tons of features you go through . <EOS>
fantastic . <EOS> and um it would uh y you'd <EOS> you could throw it at things <EOS> if if the t_v_ didn't turn on and off , you could use it for something else . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> let me uh interrupt you uh <EOS> if you can add other facility , other feature , like uh unbreakable . <EOS>
i have the mo mi i have a blinking light on my phone . <EOS> and i can change the colour of it . <EOS> okay , cool . <EOS> just make it some different colours . blue , red and green , or something . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> i dunno . <EOS> maybe it's too expensive , <EOS> but it i th i don't think so . <EOS>
uh second , and i think that's important for the marketing uh expert , <EOS> uh the current uh customers uh are in the age group group of uh forty years and older , <EOS> but with this uh new remote uh they uh will uh would like to reach uh a group uh younger than uh forty . <EOS> uh and uh <EOS> i think to keep in mind , but not really uh for now <EOS> is that they uh want the the the slogan and the and the logo uh to uh to be recognised more in the remote . <EOS> so , <EOS> we have uh forty minutes , <EOS> so i think uh not more than ten minutes uh uh per presentation uh each , <EOS> and please uh use uh all the the the facilities so that you have either smartboards , the the word files , what you uh whatever you want . <EOS> so uh <EOS>
oh . <EOS> well i don't mind , <EOS> we can further define that . <EOS> i th <EOS> um <EOS> i wouldn't have thought it'd be a problem that it went to channel six first , in like on the way to channel sixty five . <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
right . <EOS> they might see yeah , they might see this pointing down and think right that's gonna turn the volume down , <EOS> whereas the actual button's pointing up , so the function is to turn the button up . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> so , be careful what you put on the buttons <EOS> and be careful of the shape that you make them , <EOS> because they might be kind of two um
yeah , <EOS> like the volume or something . <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah , 'cause you do need um kind of brightness and contrast and everything as well . <EOS> my dad was watching a film the other week <EOS> and it was too dark , <EOS> so i had to go through it and turn the brightness up . <EOS>
paper size a_ four . uh screen size . in this directory . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> n oh . <EOS> oh yeah , <EOS> it's not connected to the <EOS> you all uh have the the questionnaire again about uh the after work . <EOS> to our p_c_s . <EOS>
we've got a battery , <EOS> one or t two batteries , or not ? <EOS> nee <EOS> one battery , with two small batteries . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> but it's it's more about the energy source , <EOS> huh ? <EOS> do you use a hand dynamo , a battery , kinetic or solar cells ? <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> oh yeah . <EOS> uh-huh . <EOS> mm-hmm , hmm . <EOS> yes . <EOS> also so you have uh uh browsing the channels , actually <EOS> so you can go up and down the channels , <EOS> uh , if you have a video or something you can forward , back . <EOS>
exactly . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> true . <EOS> right . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> the locator'll definitely be more expensive . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> um need to look into whether we can do that <EOS> but uh i think we we have some m mobile phone-based products <EOS> uh checking quickly our internet . <EOS> we really need to finish up here . but uh <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> that's it's less than a second , um . <EOS> yeah . yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> well <EOS> that's right , <EOS> and and i i don't i don't even know whether the i don't even know whether the s the signal lasts as long as you actually keep the button pressed , <EOS> or whether it's just a <EOS>
yep . <EOS> sorry . <EOS> uh . is yours the <EOS> um , try second one maybe . <EOS> try it , <EOS> yeah maybe . <EOS> oh <EOS> sorry . <EOS> okay , right . <EOS> yeah . okay . <EOS> oh , i thought i put in my last name , <EOS> i guess not , <EOS> but . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah <EOS> and if <EOS> yeah if you if you had if you had one of those uh just coming back to your other point about pressing the button and setting off the bleeper in the room that could uh <EOS>
oh it's very costly , microphone array . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> and uh so this remote control comes up with its charger . <EOS> how much does it cost this one ? <EOS> well this this prototype is um made for about uh well fi fi fifteen fifteen dollars <EOS> fifteen dollars , <EOS> but uh well it's not it's not uh <EOS> yeah , <EOS> but uh it's just a prototype <EOS> and if we uh if we optimises the um the uh voila . <EOS>
'kay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> uh position , i presume that just means right right on it , easy to see . <EOS> the main feature of it is just a simple design , simple , <EOS> lack of uh buttons all over the place . <EOS> right ? <EOS> form curved , kind of smooth , hand-held , <EOS> makes it feel nice to hold . <EOS>
maybe , if if it's possible , yeah . <EOS> mm <EOS> huh . <EOS> maybe i think even we can keep two switches and then we can uh only make one working . <EOS> on off ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> we can adapt only one switch , <EOS> suppose here like we can make two switches <EOS> and if i'm left-hander i use this switch to follow the main operations . <EOS>
impersonal , mm-hmm . <EOS> special for <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> and i if you we want to put fashion in electronics maybe we can try to do something with wood . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah , even if it is not completely wood , but just a part of the , you know , will be wooden , in wood <EOS> and it can be interesting . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> but but if you compare with these ones , uh i think they scored a one or two . <EOS> not very relevant , so <EOS> hmm . <EOS> if if there are good reason not to put teletext it's okay <EOS> but just know that people find it somehow relevant . <EOS>
yeah , <EOS> but market share fro for for forty years and younger is higher than that of sixty five and younger . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . alright . <EOS> okay , <EOS> what else does our remote need ? <EOS> um <EOS> a mute button . <EOS> mute button . <EOS>
mm-hmm <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> that's for the main functions i think <EOS> and uh then we can ask uh ourself uh what people don't have that may be useful . <EOS> for instance i think net <EOS> next slide . <EOS> one of the thing the trend uh that uh you are probably aware of is the possibility the eventual possibility of having speech recognition in your remote control , <EOS> so you wouldn't have to tap tap in your buttons <EOS> but just tell your remote control or whatever you need you have what you want . <EOS> so we've conducted a survey about uh whether people would like or not to have uh this kind of uh functionality in their remote control <EOS> and as we can see it really depends on the age . <EOS> young people , probably because it's a buzz word , find it very relevant . <EOS> and uh as the age goes up the the relevance goes down . <EOS> so now it really depends on the kind of uh targeting uh wha who are we targeting with this remote control ? <EOS> i think if we are targeting young people then uh it's probably something we have to consider . <EOS>
good design . <EOS> we only have a few minutes left . <EOS> is twenty-five euros a mid-market price for a remote ? <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah <EOS> for for multi for a multi-function remote , that's a mid-market price . <EOS> in a discount right now you can buy 'em on sale sometimes for about about uh eighteen , nineteen euro , <EOS> and that's for the multi-functions , uh d_v_d_ , v_c_r_ , uh catch-alls . <EOS> and and they have 'em in a little box in the middle , <EOS> and and this is the consciousness that most people have about replacement remote controls . <EOS> so to me , to market this a t only a television remote control we have to change consciousness . <EOS>
so <EOS> if you've got a settings , if you <EOS> yes . <EOS> but you have it's f uh <EOS> we have five or four or something . <EOS> you have a lot of options , <EOS> because when you use <EOS> yeah <EOS> you get w when you use uh the settings menu for example to look up some uh uh some channels on your uh on your television , you should scroll scroll down uh on a menu which probably does not fit on your screen . <EOS> so then it's uh very handy to to scroll down , <EOS> you make just a rubber just like uh on your mouse or . <EOS> just put it on the side and it's very easy to use . <EOS>
twenty four . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> want to get the feeling this is a twenty five euro project uh pr um <EOS> per remote control , <EOS> yeah ? <EOS> per project . <EOS> product . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yes . <EOS> okay . um <EOS> more interesting for our company of course , p uh profit aim , about fifty million euro . <EOS> so <EOS> we have to sell uh quite a lot of this uh um things . <EOS> uh we will try to uh <EOS>
uh twenty five . <EOS> yeah <EOS> mm let's say i am uh on channel eight now . <EOS> you know these days we have hundreds of channels , <EOS> that's not so easy to go just next next next when you have hundreds of channels . <EOS> or is it ? <EOS>
no . <EOS> with two batteries , the whole print plate and t and top , and if you're holding it quite a lot i think <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i think yeah , the battery should be in here , <EOS> because it's just nothing , <EOS> so if you could <EOS>
i don't know if it makes sense , but <EOS> mm-mm . <EOS> yeah , for instance , mm . <EOS> mm-hmm , mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . mm mm mm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> so adaptable <EOS> yeah something <EOS> yeah . <EOS> adaptable . alright , good , <EOS> so how many actions do we need to implement in it ? <EOS>
it could be an ape . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> 'kay . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> i'm gonna plug in here real quick . <EOS> if i could . <EOS> sure . <EOS> hang on . <EOS> there you go . <EOS> like i said we have to make a decision on a couple of these items here . <EOS> um <EOS> ow . ow . <EOS>
well right i think the two big th points that we have so far are the having the cradle <EOS> and also having uh the um the actual design of the uh case itself having like this like rubber shell maybe with a plastic interior , <EOS> having it look really nice <EOS> um and also be really durable . <EOS>
uh-huh . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> could our design involve a series of colours so that it's more of like a line where we have like sort of the , i don't know like the harvest line or the vibrant , <EOS> i dunno the <EOS> whatever <EOS> just some theme and then we have different tones , lime green , lemon . <EOS> it's just discussion . <EOS> i mean obviously we can just abandon this , <EOS> it's fine . <EOS> i'm just thinking about what we originally set out to do . <EOS>
but i didn't i uh <EOS> yeah , <EOS> i used it to y to <EOS> yeah , <EOS> it did work pretty well . <EOS> i used it too , <EOS> but <EOS> oh well . <EOS> i didn't use . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i don't think why you would want to use it actually , <EOS> but it it does work . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> bit of light . <EOS> you can <EOS> what we should do i think is is make kind of a see-through plastic button , with uh one coloured led behind it . <EOS> so that the whole button will shine <EOS> bit of light and attention . <EOS>
yeah but you can u <EOS> completely pointless yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , unless you know , you like having conversation with your remote control . <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah but the can we use it for saying okay , channel fifty , channel twenty ? <EOS>
it's pretty good uh <EOS> you have an artistic uh inner middle . <EOS> an artist . <EOS> uh a graphical user designer , so <EOS> hmm . <EOS> hey . <EOS> think you uh picked the wrong uh function . wrong job . <EOS> oh . <EOS> no . can work together . ah colour . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> mm yeah . okay , <EOS> i th i think we can do that too . <EOS> as you can see uh the minutes from the second meeting , this one , are uh are done . <EOS> done . <EOS> uh i've uh added the this uh four things from the management board just to keep in mind . <EOS> um each time i uh i had a sort of uh summary on what you told and uh what you personal think . <EOS> uh so that can be uh can be read out . <EOS> uh a f a few things i uh i noticed uh were um <EOS>
mm . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> okay so your basic components are buttons , <EOS> okay and you have a wheel available , like a mouse scroll wheel , <EOS> okay there's an l_c_d_ display , <EOS> um i think these are quite standard things . <EOS> right . <EOS> mm . <EOS>
yeah <EOS> . yeah . . <EOS> you wanna close down huh ? <EOS> yeah . that's okay . <EOS> yeah . already . <EOS> yeah . alright . <EOS> how m how long is the lunchbreak ? <EOS> i don't know . <EOS> we have to ask . nobody told me . <EOS>
yeah , yeah , you can draw the picture , of course . <EOS> yeah go ahead . <EOS> okay , so . <EOS> um . <EOS> okay , american , um . um . <EOS> i would use the bird . <EOS> so i tried to sketch it out . <EOS> i had to first uh write it down because i am not absolutely sure if i can draw it , but ah . <EOS> can you recognise it as a bird ? <EOS>
yeah <EOS> but but i mean if it's usually plus or min above each other or next to each other on a normal remote . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> uh <EOS> so not how much n not how often it's used , but <EOS> w what's what's usual or normal . <EOS> yes <EOS> i'm looking here . <EOS> but here's it's below , <EOS> here also , <EOS> and now here's here's next to each other . <EOS>
ah <EOS> cool . <EOS> okay . <EOS> so <EOS> if you hold it , it gets powered . <EOS> if you hold it . <EOS> but normally you put a remote control on the table or on the couch . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> i don't think it will work , <EOS> and <EOS> or we can also use solar cells . <EOS> but you mostly use it indoors , <EOS> so <EOS>
mm . <EOS> well i i mean <EOS> i th <EOS> i think that what we're suggesting ought to address all three of those . <EOS> uh exactly , yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm . <EOS> okay . <EOS> i s that out of sequence ? <EOS> uh yeah , <EOS> sorry . <EOS> uh yeah , and uh <EOS> from the fashion watchers from milan and paris have said fruit and vegetables are an important theme for clothes and furniture and shoes , et cetera . <EOS> uh sorry , <EOS> clothes , shoes and furniture <EOS>
okay . <EOS> um and no teletext . <EOS> i'm not sure what teletext is <EOS> but i'm assuming you guys do , <EOS> so we don't wanna include that um in this particular design . <EOS> for reasons that i don't really know . <EOS> there's <EOS> but it's the board so there you go . <EOS> so basically um <EOS> given those guidelines which will have some effect on how we design <EOS> we'll discuss it later <EOS> i mean <EOS> 'cause it's television only <EOS> we'll be able to change our <EOS> uh um well <EOS> we can s sacrifice more function for a better television remote . <EOS>
hmm . <EOS> many functions , <EOS> but well , <EOS> your thumb is a little bigger than th it than this . <EOS> you have to be very careful what you push , <EOS> and um if you're looking for teletext you'll be uh searching for half an hour <EOS> from <EOS> uh um yeah well , <EOS> where is it ? where the hell <EOS> he here i guess <EOS> and , yeah , when you have to uh use something else . <EOS> so just keep it simple , <EOS> make clear buttons , easy to use . <EOS> for example if you want to use a play and back and stop , <EOS>
well , <EOS> we had a dog , a few years ago . <EOS> and and it , <EOS> yeah , <EOS> when it died we didn't get a new one or something . <EOS> but uh <EOS> uh , it's p <EOS> had a dog ? <EOS> yeah ? <EOS> ah . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> make some mock-ups , some some general ideas . <EOS> and and then we can plan <EOS> ah okay . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> we can plan further , i think . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> but maybe , because uh you are working on the user requirements , <EOS> you are working on the technical functions , <EOS> we uh must uh have a little or kinda uh uh uh <EOS> how do you call it ? uh <EOS>
and the reality is you know , for me from an ideological stand point , i'd like to stick with the uh the solar cell , <EOS> but i h kind of have to throw myself in the in the business structure model here <EOS> and uh you know i think i think that i think that we need to come to a compromise here <EOS> and maybe move ahead with the project , without the solar cell . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> okay . <EOS> but then if you think about a watch , it's on your wrist so it's on your whole bod it's on your body the whole time <EOS> so you're walking around , you're doing things , <EOS> it is moving a lot of the time <EOS> . if you'd <EOS> i mean you switch the t_v_ on , then you put it on the side , then you pick it up to change it and then you put it on the side . <EOS> is it really gonna be enough ? <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> because we're projecting projecting the buttons on the l_c_d_ screen . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> and a touch screen makes it uh possible to uh to get the co-ordination of your finger on the screen . <EOS> and the case , yeah we already discussed the case , <EOS> we wanted to make it from rubber <EOS> and uh <EOS>
well , it's it's gotta be chew proof . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so <EOS> so it's rea it's quite <EOS> it's quite like um user friendly <EOS> and also for different families , like like family use as well , <EOS> so for little kids and for old ki like teenagers will like it , i think . <EOS> especially maybe younger girls if it's in pink they'll be like pink remote control for their room something . <EOS>
so voice activation . <EOS> so and this was what we came up with . <EOS> then if you look fifteen to twenty five <EOS> this is age , sorry , age groups . <EOS> so fifteen to twenty five said like ninety two ninety one per cent of them said yes . <EOS> um <EOS> so basically the majority except for the forty five to fifty five year olds for some reason didn't want a voice activated one . <EOS> and neither did the older generation , <EOS> but the younger generation who we are catering for , like who have most of the money nowadays , do want a voice act speech recognition in a remote . <EOS>
i think you just said at the start it was a television remote control , <EOS> so maybe we should just stick to that unless we get told otherwise . <EOS> television remote control . <EOS> right . <EOS> okay cool . <EOS> 'kay . <EOS> that's true , <EOS> 'cause during during the course of our day we might make decisions based on information or meetings that would change where we're going . <EOS> but at this point in time i think you're right that uh shall we make it just a t_v_ . <EOS> okay ? <EOS>
okay . <EOS> we <EOS> oh you're just explaining why it's not on the prototype . <EOS> but yeah , it'll be there . <EOS> so we can we could say that <EOS> yeah . yeah . it w yeah . <EOS> sorry . <EOS> oh okay . <EOS> whoo . okay . <EOS>
a also i in the case i'm not sure that you will evaluate this as a curved surface , <EOS> because it's just rubber , so it's probably a flat surface rubber . <EOS> uh i mean uh um yeah . <EOS> uh-huh . <EOS> okay , yeah . <EOS> right , so we need one fifty off . <EOS>
yeah , <EOS> it's worked for the last fifty years you know . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> one question i have , <EOS> and i don't know how much control we have over this is um , <EOS> as far as the infra-red signal , do we have control over , you know , how far away you can be from the receiving unit , the the t_v_ , and still have it be operational ? <EOS> i mean , maybe we want one with a strong signal stream . <EOS>
i think triple a_ , it'll be lighter . <EOS> two ? <EOS> could it run off of two <EOS> i mean more more come in a package . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> well , that depends on what the energy is needed . <EOS> i think , well , we could d r do two <EOS> or we could do one small lithium , <EOS> 'cause you know the lithium batteries are doing quite well in most other electronic products , right ? <EOS> so they're more widely available now . <EOS> and they also have a longer battery life than most batteries . <EOS> but if you only have to replace it every five years . <EOS>
yeah , i guess . <EOS> and then use it . <EOS> solar can do that . <EOS> we may be talking quite heavy then . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> m yeah , that would be too heavy <EOS> and it'd cost too much . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> no , <EOS> but just a rechargeable internal battery would probably i mean it might cost more to at first to develop and to install , <EOS> but for long-term use it'll be so much more convenient and economic than fiddling around trying to replace chunky a_a_ batteries and not having any in your kitchen drawer <EOS> and <EOS>
yeah , <EOS> not a problem . <EOS> fifty million was uh prof <EOS> ah now it's fif fifty million euros we've gotta uh we've g <EOS> gotta make profit , <EOS> so we're making that at twelve and a half euros a time . <EOS> as a profit . <EOS>
it's not a one though . <EOS> one would be the whole thing <EOS> no . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> because it's only got what , these parts are the grips and perhaps the back side the bottom the underneath on the back . <EOS> to fold and stuff . <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
so it feels like the whole thing's spongy , <EOS> but actually you're not damaging anything by squeezing it . <EOS> plastic inside . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> because i mean you could just get carried away with the with the tac <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i'd i'd need to talk to manufacturing again about whether that's actually possible , <EOS> but i agree , it's uh sounds like a nice idea if it is . <EOS>
but you can't push it , <EOS> so you have to tap . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> if you can't push it you have to tap the the options window uh button here and then uh scroll down with the d with uh with uh the button . <EOS> yeah , alright . <EOS> so normal scroll wheel ? <EOS>
two . <EOS> two . <EOS> two . <EOS> okay . <EOS> um spongy material ? <EOS> yeah well you have that , kind of , sort of . <EOS> we have some spongy , yeah . <EOS> yeah as much as as needed , i think . <EOS> 'kay . <EOS>
well my question is what would the scroll wheel do ? <EOS> function-wise , what does that do that <EOS> oh but that was in your presentation <EOS> so wh what would you imagine it doing ? <EOS> yeah wh wh what's the wh <EOS> yeah . well it's it's just another way to do the exact same thing that the buttons do . <EOS>
yeah you can let them to do that . <EOS> and uh isn't that too difficult <EOS> for the we want w <EOS> i don't know if we still want the um r_c_ to be easy to use , <EOS> that's the compromise . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> n no <EOS> but the if you give <EOS> it d depends on the easiness like the user how much effort he can put . <EOS> like for example uh i would like to store in certain way , <EOS> so if you want to give the full freedom to the user <EOS> or you want to keep some constraints and let the user use it with that constraint . <EOS> so it de <EOS>
tu tu tu tu <EOS> hi , good morning . <EOS> we will do some stuff , <EOS> get to know each other a bit better to feel more comfortable with each other . <EOS> um then we'll go do tool training , <EOS> talk about the project plan , <EOS> discuss our own ideas and everything um <EOS> and we've got twenty five minutes to do that , <EOS> as far as i can understand . <EOS>
yes , i'm francina . <EOS> yes , sure . <EOS> am i supposed to wipe off that or <EOS> okay . <EOS> in <EOS> no , no . no , that's okay . <EOS> no , okay . <EOS> i don't know , <EOS> we'll get to that later . <EOS>
v line thing may be something we can look into . <EOS> different skin options , <EOS> or if we can't afford this touch plate thing , or touch face screen interface um , maybe having the b images be specific , <EOS> like you could choose your menu bullets to be <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , which i think it's it's probably best actually on the on the underneath of the the device , <EOS> so you have <EOS> turbo button . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> on the th yeah , maybe here . <EOS> and the and the wheel a a at the level of the thumb for instance . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i suppose , if we're he heading to have it , like make a huge profit out of this , it needs to be quite a universally accepted thing . <EOS> like , a novelty thing might only sell a few things rather than , like , a general kind of more acceptable <EOS> but we don't wanna go towards boring , 'cause that wouldn't sell either . <EOS> so , hmm . <EOS>
uh-oh . <EOS> uh-oh . <EOS> oh , <EOS> he is the artistic design . <EOS> i'm gonna design a remote uh remote control animal . <EOS> remote control animal . <EOS> exactly . uh <EOS> oh . <EOS> sorry . <EOS> well <EOS> with the interface , it might be easier to ha to draw here and display there uh . <EOS>
uh thank you . <EOS> three like this , actually , and uh uh four five six like that and uh you can have keys like this in form like mm-hmm . <EOS> uh keys like that okay . <EOS> how much longer have we got for the meeting by the way ? <EOS> 'cause we haven't talked about demographic at all <EOS> and it's a very important issue . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> uh . <EOS> i honestly can't draw for toffee . uh . <EOS> really ? <EOS> oh that's a <EOS> yeah . <EOS> no <EOS> no <EOS> uh <EOS> a prairie dog ? <EOS> oh a squirrel ? <EOS> that's exactly what it is . <EOS> uh not a very good one <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> okay . <EOS> so , we'll meet when the we'll discuss on the further meeting . <EOS> it's okay ? <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> thanks for coming . <EOS> would you mind um at the conclusion of our meeting could could you send us a copy of your slides ? <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> there is a lot of functionality in there that is not used ninety percent of the time , <EOS> but will be used ten percent of the time , yeah . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> so <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> yeah it seems like there's like there's sort of a tension between two ideas , <EOS> i mean , you want you want one remote that maybe can work uh all all of the functions of t_v_ <EOS> and if you have whatever associated with t_v_ the d_v_d_ player , or something like that , <EOS> but like at the same time you don't wanna really busy remote with a thousand buttons on it or something . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> i think um f especially for older peo elderly people use standard buttons . <EOS> so you have that uh <EOS> a ten plus <EOS> or <EOS> yeah , the ten plus button . <EOS> just uh one one pressing , or quickly after each other . <EOS>
uh-huh . <EOS> okay . <EOS> right , yeah . <EOS> great . <EOS> and the characteristics ? <EOS> um the favourite characteristics of the cat um the whiskers i think , um <EOS> because they're the easiest to draw . <EOS> in fact , i'll give it some more <EOS>
the remote . <EOS> a fair amount . <EOS> which you could <EOS> but that's what makes it uh original though , <EOS> isn't it ? <EOS> mm . i think if we remove the the l_c_ display then there was absolutely no point to any of these meetings <EOS> and we just we could just put our branding on any other remote control . <EOS>
yeah , i think infra-red . <EOS> yeah , yeah . <EOS> sure . <EOS> so , uh about the user interface , so we are going to use l_c_d_ . <EOS> in the last meeting we talked about uh hidden buttons . <EOS> i don't know what we are going to do with that . <EOS> you talked about the buttons on the side <EOS>
and the uh the material like the plastics and so forth , we were discussing that being uh using like a rubber kind of softer feel , <EOS> um you know <EOS> li lik <EOS> if you feel the the tip on this pen it's a bit gives just a bit . <EOS> you know <EOS> something where it's uh a a more advanced f form of plastic that has some kind of a tactile response to it . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> 'cause simple buttons . <EOS> if you put one above it , it's clear . <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> so <EOS> that's it for toda for <EOS> we're going to have a lunch lunch break . um <EOS> how long is lunch break ? <EOS>
i guess we've got them all . <EOS> uh i think i go to have volume , mute but i yeah . very slow . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> the zoom buttons . <EOS> and for a t_v_ ? can you zoom in a t_v_ ? <EOS> yeah , <EOS> b <EOS> wide screen , high screen , different things you have , <EOS> yeah <EOS> different uh <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
uh yeah , crazy . <EOS> okay so you s you give <EOS> oh yeah yeah i know i know . <EOS> so you say two . <EOS> f i d i say five . <EOS> i can say , maybe there is a market for it , i dunno . <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
so that's false . <EOS> better , more intuitive buttons , yes . <EOS> true . <EOS> ugly . <EOS> no . <EOS> no . <EOS> no . <EOS> people don't respond well to ugly . <EOS> mm . <EOS> okay . <EOS> we're a little over halfway through the meeting <EOS> and the next big thing is the finance . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> uh it seems seems to me there are a number of fundamental decisions to make <EOS> before we um <EOS> i think your point about the the big energy source is uh a very valid one . <EOS> um i don't suppose we've got any statistics on the the life expectancy of uh remote controls , particularly sort of independent ones . <EOS> um given <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> oh , okay , yeah , sure , uh <EOS> yeah yeah yeah . <EOS> oh , yeah yeah , <EOS> sure , that would be possible , yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> now we uh just connect uh the t_v_ type uh to a set of options , in just just in the memory , <EOS> so that if you <EOS> yeah , like profile , <EOS> so that if you uh touch in like uh one four one zero kind of t_v_ uh <EOS>
right . <EOS> that's impressive . <EOS> that's <EOS> yeah . <EOS> that's pretty impressive . <EOS> cool . <EOS> oh dear . yes . <EOS> i live um i live right across the street from an open space in california . <EOS> we have coyotes howl all the time . <EOS> so i really enjoy their their singing , <EOS> you they're really beautiful animals . mm . <EOS>
speech recognition . <EOS> well , uh <EOS> training is always an issue with uh commands . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> so um <EOS> might <EOS> uh we can perhaps um do it if the user is willing to spend some time in the training process , <EOS> uh it could reduce th th uh the overall um cost . <EOS> not sure how . <EOS> but um anyway , um i i think also that uh this might impact the battery life . <EOS> and um so , <EOS> maybe what we'll have to do is um add something where you can um recharge it wirelessly <EOS> so that uh y you know sen send power to it . <EOS> so uh <EOS> or maybe uh set it out in the sun <EOS> and it uh , you know , gets uh , from the light , um a a solar cell inside there <EOS> so that uh you have enough uh juice to do all these fancy things . <EOS>
yeah , <EOS> okay . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> this this kinda touches on your comments there , david . <EOS> these are the age groups which we have information on <EOS> and these are <EOS> this is a table of h what people would pay more for a certain feature . <EOS> just gives us a rough idea of where the w the will to spend money on t_v_ equipment is . <EOS> mostly focused around the twenty five age group . <EOS>
one is most . <EOS> i <EOS> uh-uh . <EOS> um . <EOS> well , <EOS> we can choose what we want . <EOS> okay , <EOS> let's say that seven is the best . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> or maybe we can say s <EOS> seven is the best mm . <EOS>
okay okay <EOS> or it won't . <EOS> okay we'll have to deal with it like this then . <EOS> alright . um . <EOS> okay . so um . <EOS> so that was the opening . <EOS> the first thing we'll do is get acquainted with one another . <EOS> if everyone could go around and explain their role and um , and their name . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> no , it's it was uh not enough . <EOS> you see this beautiful presentation . <EOS> okay <EOS> let's get started . <EOS> yeah . very nice . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> uh i sort of prepared this . <EOS> uh opening acquaintance , tool training , uh how to use the things here . uh project plan discussion , and yeah then the rest of the meeting . <EOS> um we're supposed to develop a new remote control , <EOS> that's both original , trendy and user-friendly . <EOS>
most people <EOS> yeah . <EOS> in fact in in one uh remote control that i've seen , instead of doing that d you could just say these are the cha ch channel three , twenty eight , forty eight and uh sixty four are those that i want to by cycled with my next button . <EOS> i uh <EOS>
mm . <EOS> um , and then we could then keep our ideas sort of building on that . <EOS> i know that people who design cars and you know in aviation they quite often just have a simple like fibreglass prototype <EOS> and it's completely you know um abs abstract from the final product , but they use it as a kind of a context to sort of walk around and puzzle and and point and discuss <EOS> and and <EOS> and in a way everybody's as we discuss things in the in theoretically and out of our notebooks , <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> i think it depends , <EOS> i mean i think it's a good idea , <EOS> but we need to really think about how useful it's gonna be <EOS> because theoretically with the t_v_ you already have a big display right in front of you . <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> so <EOS> we got <EOS> some the bad stuff we got , <EOS> remotes are often lost . <EOS> i often lose my remote control , the back of the couch , some place , <EOS> and even if it's not lost permanently , it takes me a few minutes to find it . <EOS> most buttons are not used any more , <EOS> like you said , teletext is outdated now . <EOS> i remember trying to load a d_v_d_ player recently , <EOS> and there were so many buttons , <EOS> it took me i don't know maybe ten minutes to to go through each button , <EOS> 'cause you have to press the shift button to access the yellow buttons , <EOS> you know <EOS> there's just a lot of stuff that no one really uses . <EOS> and if they do , not very often . <EOS> takes too long to master the remote control . <EOS> i've seen some remote controls that are big , <EOS> they have a lot of buttons , <EOS> you have to hold down more than one key at one time to do something , <EOS> they're just not great to use . <EOS> we just got a lot of bad complaints about remote controls , <EOS> people do not like remote controls . <EOS> some of the good stuff we got . <EOS> between the age of uh fifteen and twenty five , most people would be willing to pay extra for voice recognition software . <EOS> now don't get excited yet , <EOS> i've got more to say on that . <EOS> most people'd be willing to pay for that <EOS> um most people want remote controls to be pretty , <EOS> they want it to be fancy , <EOS> th they they want it to be different , <EOS> everybody has a white remote control with black buttons , and a red button and a green button , <EOS> not everybody wants that . <EOS> finally , my opinion . <EOS>
oh , brilliant then . <EOS> well , if they've just developed the sample sensor , sample speaker , it's a brand new chip . <EOS> why not introduce it in this way ? <EOS> no . <EOS> yeah , good point . <EOS> mm 'kay . <EOS> uh and what size batteries , double a_ , triple a_ ? <EOS>
yeah i always lose my <EOS> yeah , so so i if it is a universal one i can use it with my t_v_ , so it would be <EOS> okay . <EOS> one thing i like is the shape , because you know it's not like the uh the remote controls you can put in your pocket , on uh in your jacket . <EOS>
s <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> huh . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> you know , i've seen some remotes that where you just hold one , <EOS> like if you hold one down it's it's a different colour than the other buttons but that turns it on . <EOS> so you don't actually have a separate power button , it's just <EOS>
uh <EOS> they more want these fancy features like <EOS> i think i <EOS> yeah <EOS> i it's again in this uh <EOS> what i said first <EOS> it has to be fancy <EOS> so i think if nobody else pro provides currently a remote control with that kind of stuff and if we can provide it i think it's a good sell for us <EOS> because we have it <EOS> and others don't . <EOS> it's fancy . <EOS> whether it's useful or not doesn't seem to be very important . <EOS>
so what does m_e_ means ? <EOS> m_e_ the user requirements ? <EOS> or that's uh that's for us ? <EOS> market expert . <EOS> marketing yeah . <EOS> mm . <EOS> uh that's me . <EOS> oh , of course yeah , <EOS> the user requirement specifications , <EOS> uh-huh , yeah . <EOS>
so this is our project . <EOS> what we're aiming to do is to create a new remote control for a television . <EOS> um we want it to be something original , something trendy and also something user friendly , <EOS> so it has to be quite intuitive that people are able to use this product . <EOS> the method that we're going to use to complete the project , that has three components as such . <EOS> there's the functional design of the the remote control . <EOS> we're going <EOS> the way we'll do that i think is to to work individually initially <EOS> and then come together for meetings to to work on that . <EOS> um similarly with the conceptual design , <EOS> we'll start off by working individually with our own expertise on our own laptops <EOS> and then we'll bring what we've done together . <EOS> um and then the detailed design will come after that . <EOS> we'll pull it all together . <EOS>
yes . <EOS> right ? <EOS> we were able to do it with that kind of chip . <EOS> oh right , <EOS> the <EOS> we could do it with the chip , yes . <EOS> it wasn't <EOS> we have no reflection of it on the prototype , <EOS> but that's because it's only two dimensions , really . <EOS>
'kay i'm i'm listening <EOS> i'm just trying to incorporate the logo into the the thing , so i'm playing with the play-doh as well . <EOS> oh right , okay . <EOS> just in case you're wondering , why is he still playing with the play-doh ? <EOS> huh . <EOS>
should we change that tha that that's a one if not , <EOS> or not ? <EOS> could you copy it ? <EOS> and make it uh <EOS> mm yep . <EOS> we dropped the scroll wheel . <EOS> and the rest is the same , <EOS> huh ? <EOS> y yea the scroll wheel is dropped . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay , <EOS> so fewer buttons maybe would be good ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> f not many buttons , and uh and uh uh u useable buttons . <EOS> okay . <EOS> but what kind of remote controls did you look at ? <EOS>
mm . <EOS> oh . <EOS> just something like keep in mind when we start actually dealing with this stuff <EOS> but that would be really cool . <EOS> uh let's see . um . <EOS> i like the idea of the uh multi plate . <EOS> in in <EOS> yeah yeah okay . <EOS>
yeah , like you have one , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight , nine , zero . <EOS> well , we definitely need those . <EOS> how how , <EOS> yeah , <EOS> how would you leave those out ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
when i think of it uh <EOS> i think the main idea uh of this remote remote control is uh <EOS> not that much . <EOS> to make it user friendly . <EOS> so uh <EOS> i think uh when p uh when uh the customers will buy this remote control , they already have uh the remote control which uh companies uh uh with uh the the standards uh remote control with which comes uh with the television . <EOS> so uh <EOS> it only has to have uh the most used buttons . <EOS> you don't have to integrate the buttons to search the channels on your television . <EOS> in those in that <EOS>
can you fit any uh for example a t_f_t_ or any electronic device in a spongy thing , or is there any problem for that ? <EOS> for example , put electronic card on a spongy thing , i can i can imagine it could be a problem . <EOS> a all these things in in uh in this box are okay to put in in any shape , basically . <EOS> but we have to take care of the t_f_t_ . <EOS> well , sponginess . maybe it a good feature , since it takes if it's around the t_f_t_ then it's good , because it's just keeps it safe , <EOS> i dunno . <EOS>
bluetooth would , for example , enable you , i think , to um um connect for example you if you get a w call on your mobile phone , but your mobile phone is downstairs or something , you would get on your television you're being called by this person right now . <EOS> things like that . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> cool . <EOS> so um <EOS> b b <EOS> kate and kendra now go away <EOS> and uh pa play play with a bit of plasticine or play-dough , <EOS> whatever it is on the other side of the atlantic . <EOS> um and actually put what we've discussed into something uh i was gonna say concrete , <EOS> but that's a slightly inappropriate word <EOS> um to something that we can we can see <EOS> and um andrew n can go away and th th think about how we can uh actually market this as a concept and not j not just a uh um a a simple remote control . <EOS>
the ma the management has had it's own thoughts on this and uh the they don't necessarily agree with with what we uh we thought . <EOS> um and and then we'll <EOS> as a result of that we will then talk through the the functions that we see the the device um actually b carrying out , <EOS> and we have uh forty minutes to do this in <EOS> and i uh <EOS> anyway . okay . now , <EOS> the n the new requirements are um the the management team see that um teletext is no longer of any importance given the uh the rise of the internet . <EOS> um and and they want it only to cover televisions . <EOS> um now , <EOS> what is not q quite clear from their directive is <EOS> whether they mean th they don't want it to cover teletext <EOS> or whether they don't want it to cover , you know , videos , d_v_d_s , um satellite boxes , <EOS> which uh i mean we saw as being fundamental to the uh to the exercise . <EOS> the um the actual wording of the directive is that it should cover television only . <EOS> um and on that basis um i i think we we need to bear that in mind , <EOS> um but possibly uh keep at the backs of our minds that the reality that people even when they uh no longer they don't look at teletext anymore , they certainly do look at other things . <EOS> um the device has to incorporate the company logo and colours . <EOS> um the the logo uh being at b the bottom of the screen there , the the the two r_s in grey against uh a yellow background . <EOS> um now <EOS> this doesn't necessarily mean that we have to give up some of our ideas about making it attractive to the t to the market . <EOS> but uh do do introduce some some constraints as to how we might do that . <EOS> um it also has to be simple , <EOS> which to some extent goes along w with the first one , <EOS> and that we've already said that it must be simple <EOS> 'cause that's what people want anyway . <EOS> um but they also want it to be simple to get it to the market quickly , <EOS> which um mm uh is is is their choice , <EOS> but uh um we we need to talk that through . <EOS> um okay , so uh <EOS> after the meeting it'll be summarised <EOS> and uh <EOS>
oh , a d a dynamo ? <EOS> yeah , . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , i like that , yeah . <EOS> yeah , like with those watches that you kind of twist . <EOS> yeah that's quite cool . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay . so if it if it's not working , i guess people's natural reaction anyway is to just shake the thing . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> and these might've made us more willing to like take notes than to like write up them here , <EOS> 'cause we all needed them separately , kind of on the whiteboards in this room . <EOS> mm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> because we're all gonna be working in different places . <EOS> we <EOS> if we were all gonna stay in here all the time , then having the notes up on the whiteboard would've been alright , <EOS> but everyone needs their own , like specific notes , i guess . <EOS>
um i don't think we ne really need the scroll whe wheel . <EOS> i mean it might be nice for changing the volume . <EOS> uh but <EOS> oh . <EOS> it would be nice for changing the volume , <EOS> but i don't know how useful it'd be for changing the channel . <EOS> 'cause you don't have control over numbers <EOS> or <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah , one is high . <EOS> ah , okay <EOS> so yeah , two or three . <EOS> 'kay <EOS> okay , <EOS> it's upside-down . <EOS> let's go with two point five then . <EOS> okay , um <EOS> control <EOS> high tech innovation . <EOS>
mm , mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> uh if we look at this data how how uh h how what are the problems the consumers are facing with the existing remote controls in the market . <EOS> they find that thirt uh thirty five percent uh thirty four percent of the consumers they find too difficult to operate a remote control . <EOS> so it should be in such a way that it should be easy to learn how to operate these remote controls <EOS> and we should provide pl uh spe uh proper manuals for its use also so as that people consumers could easily learn . <EOS> they need not to have any , much technical knowledge to see uh to know how to operate these remote controls . <EOS>
yeah , okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> i like the whole sort of remote feedback thing . <EOS> um so i think rather than <EOS> and that also kind of takes out the speech recognition in terms of the interference of it not working very well and things like that , <EOS> so i th <EOS> yeah and expense and the time . <EOS> so i think if we're going to go <EOS> well i mean like the thing about the there's the problem with the t_f_t_ or the l_c_d_ kind of thing is if you're also wanting the the kind of <EOS>
it can't be curved . <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> right . <EOS> okay . <EOS> right can i <EOS> uh question on <EOS> can i ask a question ? <EOS> yeah well yeah <EOS> it's just i'm quite keen to get the discussion going with the time we've left so <EOS> but yeah you c ask away . <EOS>
i think that's probably a question more for <EOS> is that for over here ? <EOS> okay , alright . <EOS> for this guy here , yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> well it's kinda both of us . <EOS> us us user interface . <EOS> is it ? <EOS> okay . <EOS>
thank you . <EOS> . <EOS> oh . oh oh <EOS> i think you ga <EOS> oh , um , <EOS> you can clip them to your belt . <EOS> do we take them off ? <EOS> oh right , <EOS> okay . <EOS> you should also l um have your the lapel mic on as well . <EOS>
what are we doing ? <EOS> adding them up ? <EOS> we're gonna average them ? <EOS> okay . so seven fourths . <EOS> about one point f one point eight . <EOS> oh . <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> oh i see . <EOS> yeah round it up to two . <EOS> so trends . <EOS>
y you should make uh a sideways uh view . <EOS> yeah . the sideways view , <EOS> uh that that that ma <EOS> it will be , i guess . oh , we can <EOS> ho <EOS> not that pen . not that pen . <EOS> oh <EOS> g i would smart board . <EOS> uh can i draw here or uh <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> uh let's um specify the target group . <EOS> because are we talking about elderly elderly people or people from forty to eighty . <EOS> because i think what we're going to design now is for people above sixty , maybe . <EOS> mm . yeah . <EOS>
device . <EOS> and that's not normal at the uh normal remote controls . <EOS> 'cause i think learnable is a l a less than um easy to use . <EOS> because easy to use comes after learnable . <EOS> i i think it a three or something . <EOS> but <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
fashion into electronic . okay . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah , that would be best , yeah . <EOS> yeah . yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> you don't buy a t_v_ every week , new teev so . <EOS> okay , <EOS> let's uh save this in the meanwhile uh <EOS> no no . exactly , so <EOS>
oh . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> i got it at my home , like . <EOS> oops . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> ah it's <EOS> mm-hmm , so <EOS> let's to think <EOS> s so that <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i think that could be in the component uh concept uh . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> yeah and then . <EOS> and then you can have um <EOS> if you actually just want to zap , you can have like a thing like that , and that , and then it can just be plus and minus . <EOS> okay . <EOS> so like it's like a little part of the circle that <EOS> or it <EOS> oh so it's just a region of the circle that you can <EOS>
big and a long tail . <EOS> okay , <EOS> do y do you wanna do some write <EOS> you wanna just write some words about it ? <EOS> why ? <EOS> because um cuddly . <EOS> and usually cats are very friendly . <EOS> usually . <EOS> and they're healing as well . <EOS> they heal . <EOS> and they can feel when a human's got problems so <EOS>
mm-hmm yeah . <EOS> oka <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> okay . <EOS> uh well , just to to wrap up quickly on this this little section <EOS> have i just lost <EOS> oh no . <EOS> um , uh do you think maybe that's the only kind of uh essential requirements , <EOS> and then maybe just things that would be nice if it could do would be things like audio set up and display set up and things like that , <EOS> maybe like a mute button , <EOS> that sort of thing . <EOS> any of you anything to add to that at all ? <EOS> no . <EOS>
hmm . <EOS> well <EOS> we're selling so many units of this . <EOS> this is gonna be a mass marketed product , <EOS> we can afford to have two or three different designs at least . <EOS> hmm . mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah a range of uh yeah , a set of three , four different aspects . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> i th i th honest uh <EOS> my personal view is that if it's not there , people wouldn't use it anyway um . <EOS> mm i suppose , <EOS> but t there is the off chance that , you know , th the brightness is wrong on your t_v_ <EOS> or the contrast needs changing . <EOS>
um , as you can see , the different roles have uh different tasks . <EOS> and there's a ping . <EOS> is it my laptop ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yep . <EOS> stop the meeting now . <EOS> ah well <EOS> that's good , <EOS> five minutes and uh the meeting's over , uh right on schedule . <EOS> um the marketing expert will uh will take a look at the user requirement specification . <EOS> the user interface designer will work out the technical functions design . <EOS> and this was the interface designer ? <EOS> or the interaction designer . <EOS> or what was it , i_d_ ? <EOS> interface designer , okay , <EOS> first guess was right . <EOS> uh will take a look at the the working design . <EOS>
yeah , f it depends what what you feel about that . <EOS> you have a heart attack . <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah but we can we can think of these things afterwards , <EOS> but if you have some more notes on that . <EOS> yeah <EOS> so you can <EOS> do you have something ? <EOS>
. <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> mm . yeah i really like that idea . <EOS> so <EOS> what functionalities do you suggest for that ? for facing this problem ? <EOS> so <EOS> it it it's like <EOS> it limited one . <EOS> in the present market i saw it that says something like they are looking for eighty word thing , eighty word , <EOS> which shouldn't be th that difficult to implement , like eighty to hundred word . <EOS> basically you want you don't want to store all the channels in the remote control , <EOS> you want to st store your favourite channel . <EOS> yeah some ten twelve channel information . <EOS> you know <EOS> you don't want to st store all the hundred channel information into that . <EOS>
mm . mm . <EOS> mm-hmm . mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> w you get those ones where you can , if you like , whistle or make a really high pitched noise they beep . <EOS> there <EOS> i mean is that something we'd want to include , do you think ? <EOS>
okay . <EOS> right . <EOS> right . <EOS> 'kay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> come on . <EOS>
i'm designing the user interface . <EOS> okay . <EOS> you can uh . <EOS> okay . <EOS> so maybe i can switch slides when you whenever you ask , <EOS> that will be more convenient . <EOS> so okay , <EOS> functional requirements . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay so you can you can go . <EOS> okay so <EOS> in our usability lab we observed the remote control use among one hundred subjects <EOS> and the subjects also filled a questionnaire <EOS> okay ? <EOS>
open . <EOS> okay . <EOS> how to make it big ? <EOS> slide show . <EOS> five . <EOS> slide show . okay , <EOS> thanks . <EOS> it should work , <EOS> so you can . <EOS> okay . <EOS> oh so i will speak about working design . <EOS> that's the first slide . <EOS> uh what uh i have to do ? <EOS> a look at what the other company <EOS> okay so uh presently i am looking what is possible to use , <EOS> what circuits to use and stuff like that <EOS> because uh i didn't work uh with these uh circuits so far <EOS> so i have to look what what is a v a v available on the market for for the communication for the i_r_ circuits and so on , <EOS> so i'm currently looking what is available on the web . <EOS> and uh i wanted to ask you m maybe afterwards , after after our discussion , if we have some contacts in some companies , so , which can report on what is going on there , <EOS> so , i would be glad if you can tell me about them . <EOS> so , you know . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> uh can you go to the next slide please ? <EOS> uh components uh the main components we need for uh it ha like buttons and uh underneath that there should be switch . <EOS> and uh bulbs . <EOS> like uh we can have a bulb like whenever we are operating a remote controller or uh whenever the t_v_ is on suppose , <EOS> then the remote controller should automatically have a b s light . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> so and in this way our product is good . <EOS> and the second thing , now people don't want any complicated or bulky products and ours is quite simple and quite handy . <EOS> so that is also ef that also <EOS> our product meets the f the fashion uh trends of the market . <EOS> and yes . <EOS> it is cus spongy also . <EOS> so they can play with it , it's quite good . <EOS> so then i think , maybe i can give it two . <EOS> so four five ten thirteen thirteen . <EOS> so we can <EOS> is it fine ? <EOS> so what about company strategy ? <EOS>
oh , like overlap between what you said ? <EOS> oh well , for all you know that that'll happen . <EOS> mm hard to know what where your role ends , yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> um function f_ eight . <EOS> uh pr yeah , press function and f_ eight , yeah . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> tadada . <EOS> we have to sum up everything . <EOS> twenty . <EOS> thirteen uh , twenty , twenty six point five , uh seven , thirty two , thirty six . <EOS> that's that's okay ? <EOS> thirty . thir <EOS> six . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> okay , uh . so um . <EOS> does anybody want to uh <EOS> uh <EOS> andrew do you want what do you want to say about um the uh yeah the evaluation <EOS> where where you know well where where we're where where we're at ? <EOS>
the major ones , yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> right . <EOS> okay . <EOS> what we have to do now is to go back to our little places , <EOS> complete our questionnaire <EOS> and some sort of summarisation , <EOS> which y you'll get immediately by email . <EOS> send me your presentations so that i can use them to make the minutes , <EOS> and then we've got a lunch break <EOS> and after lunch we go back to our own little stations and have thirty minutes more work . <EOS> um i'll put the minutes in that project documents folder , <EOS> but i'll send you an email when i do it , so that you know . <EOS> it should be on your desktop , <EOS> so on the <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so i'll put it i'll put them there as soon as i've written them . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm , mm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> but also er ergonomics as we're saying with the different designs , ergonomics <EOS> uh there's sort of physically different things <EOS> 'cause um if you've ever seen the x_ box they had to make two different sized controllers <EOS> because people in japan wouldn't buy it <EOS> because the controller was physically to big <EOS> because um
so users have different i mean they have their own interests , colour interests and so okay . <EOS> so ? <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> so we can just if they want they can just pay another two euro . <EOS> uh-huh , okay , <EOS> so <EOS> you you propose something with option i that increase the price if we if you want o more colours on l_c_d_ , <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> so but i think that's something we need to to work on next time is really finding out more about the target market . <EOS> yep . <EOS> any any new ideas we could uh we could investigate next time ? <EOS> dunno , oranges ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> the cost of the thing can be made more than might be . <EOS> because i think it's just the optimal , what we have done for the cost which we are looking forward to . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah <EOS> i think we have like and it's not very usable <EOS> and it will bring down the robustness of the whole thing , <EOS> 'cause it's it it breaks down easier . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> for me i think the scroll wheel actually might not be so bad . <EOS> i don't know exactly what the increased cost is gonna be , <EOS> but i think he does have a point , <EOS> i it might push somebody over the edge when they're looking at our at our remote versus something else , when they see this one has a scroll wheel to go up and down on the channels . <EOS> i think it might be kinda neat to be able to do it like that . <EOS>
can you with a small lithium battery ? <EOS> alright . <EOS> moving along . <EOS> oh , <EOS> we're closing the meeting . <EOS> next meeting is gonna start in thirty minutes . <EOS> here's what we're going to do . <EOS> um the i_d_ , <EOS> which is who ? <EOS> okay , <EOS> you're going to think about the working design . <EOS> what do you think that means ? <EOS>
that's like mine it was like , would you prefer an l_c_d_ screen or a multifunction remote control ? <EOS> and then it didn't have like any kind of table , <EOS> like <EOS> awesome , <EOS> i'm glad they asked that question and didn't report the result . <EOS> it's really interesting though . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> um i'm actually gonna be bold and go oo go straight for rubber um for reasons i'll go into uh in more detail . <EOS> okay . <EOS> i also have a preference for rubber . <EOS> okay , <EOS> well um <EOS> based on my research . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> okay , and second <EOS> as already discussed with william , <EOS> we are going to have m maybe a g_ g_u_i_ interface in the f in the middle of the flip-top <EOS> and g graphic user interface <EOS> basically which is what we d do in computer , have icons or touch pad or whatever , <EOS> which is <EOS>
oh right , okay . <EOS> we've w definitely talking some type of <EOS> um . <EOS> but didn't they just say it's just for t_v_ , <EOS> or are we gonna <EOS> it's just for t_v_ , <EOS> but for <EOS> different . <EOS> programming it to use your t_v_ , you might hook it up to the p_c_ . <EOS> i i'm not sure , but i'm thinking maybe that the additional cost of the u_s_b_ might be prohibitive . <EOS> we don't know unless it would make sense to . <EOS>
um what we are gonna talk about in this meeting is um <EOS> now that we know what it is that we are doing , now we know that it's a t_v_ remote and stuff <EOS> and you guys have just been off doing some some uh r_ and d_ for that , <EOS> that's research and development for those that haven't heard that before , <EOS> see i'm learning all sorts of new technologi terms in technology today . <EOS> um yeah , we're gonna hear your uh th three little presentations , <EOS> whether they be on computer or on the whiteboard or whatever you want . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> mm . <EOS> uh . so uh <EOS> so i will ask you all to do the same . <EOS> just to get used to the whiteboard . <EOS> okay . <EOS> so probably i would try to try to draw the animal . <EOS> well sh should i draw the picture of the animal ? <EOS> i i th i think i should . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> well i mean we could make a <EOS> yeah . <EOS> well , si since we're going for the uh the k the sort of company colours , i think your lemon wasn't that far s <EOS> and if it doesn't work you know , we've just made a lemon . <EOS>
tha <EOS> yeah , <EOS> i mean we that's we we <EOS> yeah . <EOS> this is the remote control tomato . <EOS> well <EOS> i can say in this country , you'll get , you know , lots of people wanting something really funky and cool . <EOS> like <EOS> and kids will be walking in with their parents saying , mummy i wanna buy that one . <EOS> and uh parents will see the will see the pro as well , because it's um <EOS>
uh . <EOS> oh <EOS> it wasn't in the way but yeah , whatever . <EOS> no , don't worry about it . <EOS> sure . <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so <EOS> have we decided that we are gonna go with different style cases for different people ? <EOS> or are we just going to go with one ? <EOS>
um . well , <EOS> i guess it's kind of dra uh <EOS> you don't necessarily have to have it sort of clearly identified as a fruit just to have that kind of fruitish shape , <EOS> yeah ? <EOS> no . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , then only we can relate it with something . <EOS> yeah . exactly . <EOS>
i <EOS> w yeah , but <EOS> we have tactile buttons . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> i see , you have microphone array embedded . <EOS> you have <EOS> that's good . <EOS> no , that's good . yeah . <EOS> oh , yeah . <EOS> yeah , th that's another really good point . <EOS> maybe okay . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah yeah . <EOS> i think it's <EOS> that's right . <EOS> i think so . <EOS> and if we we keep the rest in a format that is durable <EOS> because th th the whole product's gonna need to be more durable th thus <EOS> because you're not going to be ditching it as often . <EOS> it's gonna need to be more expensive because of the cradle . <EOS>
yep . <EOS> okay . <EOS> so <EOS> well maybe it can have two shells , a hard shell inside and a spongy shell outside . <EOS> so <EOS> okay . <EOS> maybe put electronic in a box and a spongy thing around . <EOS> maybe after . <EOS> well , it's maybe related to the u_i_ . <EOS> a yeah , that's all from me . <EOS>
ah is that what that is ? <EOS> or uh or a high speed train . <EOS> right <EOS> and having personally worked with all these products uh i have a great deal of experience with uh with industrial design of these . <EOS> well that's cool . <EOS> if you if you can build space craft you'll have no problem with a remote control , yeah . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> the size and the the shape . well well mm . <EOS> be before ta talking about the money and what's possible and what is not possible , maybe anna you can uh give our uh give us your um <EOS> mm-hmm . okay . and maybe we run the evaluation on both of the products , both of these two . <EOS>
x_ marks spot . <EOS> and the menu is avail that is available is easy to use . <EOS> i think it is , <EOS> but i don't know what you think . <EOS> i think it's easier to use than a regular remote control , <EOS> because when you push on the options menu , you get the the the various options uh entirely explained . entirely explained . <EOS>
just put it on the deskt desktop . <EOS> no <EOS> on the desktop you'll find you should find that there's a project documents link . <EOS> a <EOS> well <EOS> actually just there . <EOS> yeah . that's it . <EOS> if you dump it in there . <EOS> project documents , <EOS> yeah . <EOS> what's your username ? <EOS>
yep , <EOS> they're called um disfluencies . <EOS> disfluencies . <EOS> that's a good word for it . <EOS> yeah <EOS> we like our fancy phrases and terminologies for things . <EOS> just add some prefixes , <EOS> sounds classier . <EOS> exactly <EOS> uh i will save this into the project documents . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yep , right . <EOS> li <EOS> that'll be the covers as well , yeah yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , yeah . <EOS> i mean tha it's it's a detailed point , <EOS> i just wondered i mean h how will people put these down i wonder ? <EOS> right . <EOS>
so , wha what i think for now is we don't want to have a remote control w which is wired <EOS> so uh i think we u we can use a battery for the . <EOS> then two programmable chips for both software functionalities and communication . <EOS> and the communication with the t_v_ set is uh made through uh infrared communication <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> i mean it is it's up to it's up to <EOS> yeah , <EOS> just another five euro to get <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> it's it's up to our marketing people to to ma to ma turn it into a a fashion item . <EOS> um and , you know , as as external fashions change , then we get new new covers on the market and , you know , readily available . <EOS> and um <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> okay . <EOS> so perhaps some sort of menu-based thing , or <EOS> something that's a little less crowded than this , <EOS> like i mean you know , theoretically you can do all kinds of things with your t_v_ , right ? <EOS> but what do most people do ? <EOS> they turn it on , they watch certain specified channels , you know , and then they turn it off again . <EOS> sometimes they play a movie . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> so but yeah . <EOS> yeah that makes sense . <EOS> so presentation from i guess design would go best . next . <EOS> technical functions or interface concept ? <EOS> i think <EOS> oh interface concept . <EOS> very long presentation . <EOS> yeah that's it . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> no hand dynamo . <EOS> hand <EOS> yeah . <EOS> electronics , simple chip <EOS> advanced chip , <EOS> right ? <EOS> we have <EOS> no , <EOS> we have sample speaker . <EOS> but b al but we also have sample speaker , do <EOS> on advanced chip . <EOS> yeah , yeah . <EOS>
well <EOS> we will soon , <EOS> unfortunately . <EOS> um okay , so <EOS> come on . <EOS> did you say ? <EOS> uh okay , <EOS> so <EOS> no , . <EOS> wha how do we feel in terms of is this fancy ? <EOS> it depends what what you mean by fancy really , <EOS> 'cause when i think of fancy , i think of it's got lots of extra sort of fripperies and , you know , like baroque curliness <EOS> and which <EOS>
you know , subtitles , mute , there's a lotta buttons that i've got no idea what they do , like . <EOS> well , <EOS> that's a really good point , <EOS> because i think one of the things that being somewhat computer literate , we tend to um go to menus and then make choices , <EOS> you know , <EOS> so if it's like an uh volume button , you know , you can go in and say mute or or volume . <EOS> we don't need to have like the l the numbers if we also have uh uh channel up channel down . <EOS>
an it does how feasible it is . <EOS> i- mm . <EOS> but i think if you to recognise numbers it's a well-studied problem . <EOS> i if you just recognise uh numbers is a limited you have limited vocabulary <EOS> oh we can put an limited vocabulary as in the mobile phones . <EOS> we just have the <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> okay <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> so do you think we're we're aiming at a fairly young market then ? <EOS> yep . <EOS> sort of young professional , kind of . mm-hmm <EOS> yeah , okay . <EOS> um <EOS> um do you think then uh voice recognition is something we should really seriously consider ? <EOS> what what do you think , craig ? <EOS>
you can pick sports , you can pick the news , you entertainment , <EOS> you know it's like <EOS> so anyway <EOS> so it's like a separate channel from like what you're watching ? <EOS> right . <EOS> right . <EOS> but it's becoming out-dated now , because of the internet . <EOS> nobody needs to go to the teletext channel to check the news , <EOS> and we have twenty four hour news channels now too , so <EOS> those are our new product requirements . <EOS> alright . mm-hmm . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> oh that would be nice . <EOS> ah it'd fall over all the time though . <EOS> it'd be annoying . <EOS> uh yeah , <EOS> it's less um , what's th ha . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i g <EOS> if it's weighted maybe . <EOS> details , details . <EOS> okay . so , is this a good-looking remote ? <EOS> would we wanna show it off to our friends ? <EOS>
it's on the side . <EOS> ah , you did get that in then , <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> oh okay , . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> see ? <EOS> so the volume is you just scroll , <EOS> but then once you flip it open , okay , there there you have the screen <EOS> and and you have the mm spinning wheel with options to choose . <EOS> you can move back and forth <EOS> and then if you need to m choose something on the screen , you just push the cen mm the middle button . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> but i thought we were good orally . <EOS> get crazy . <EOS> and with and with the powerpoint that we can all look at , like you can do all those things pretty much on powerpoint <EOS> as that's not as necessary to have . <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
that's a very unnatural motion to <EOS> yeah . <EOS> can you imagine you have to scroll a lot . <EOS> um it might work for volume , <EOS> and maybe some of the brightness controls and stuff like that , <EOS> but not for channels right . <EOS> if you have a telewest box you've got like , you don't have to buy all the channels , <EOS> you've about fifty channels , <EOS> can you imagine trying to . <EOS> um and i don't think having that you know too quick too slow kin it's confusing to the <EOS> i dunno . <EOS>
there we go , <EOS> i've got a bit more of the cable . <EOS> okay . <EOS> oh . <EOS> there we go . <EOS> is that okay ? <EOS> yeah <EOS> i think you can pull it out now . <EOS> thank you , <EOS> just pull it closer a little bit . <EOS>
i think unfortunately that's our best option . <EOS> mm . <EOS> 'cause we can't remove the push buttons <EOS> 'cause they're <EOS> um and we can't get rid of the uh i mean removing the <EOS> changing the case wouldn't be so much of a <EOS> it kind of <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> i like our little finished products . <EOS> can we market this as the mango remote ? <EOS> should we have that somewhere on the packaging ? <EOS> they're funny . <EOS> really cute . <EOS> i kind of want one . <EOS> i have a little r_r_ . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> that would be my feeling as well , <EOS> i think we could possibly create quite a useful user interface . <EOS> um now i mean <EOS> i don't <EOS> sure <EOS> but the idea of a remote with a menu or and a joystick i think like i h if i was in the habit of buying remote controls then i would want one , <EOS> but i think we don't have a specific audience , <EOS> you know , <EOS> like what is our target audience , <EOS> what niche are niche are we trying to market and corner . <EOS> you know , <EOS> you know what i'm saying , <EOS> like , <EOS> for whom is this intended ? <EOS> everybody ? <EOS>
l <EOS> yeah , <EOS> i it it should be soft . <EOS> you said so ? <EOS> yeah , okay . <EOS> that uh fruit and veg , or <EOS> yeah , <EOS> fruit and veg can be just the covers . <EOS> uh yeah i just just on front . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> right . <EOS> see if there if there's even interest out there . <EOS> off the top of my head it sounds kind of like a gimmick that wouldn't really go anywhere . <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay . right . <EOS> yeah <EOS> 'cause then ha you would have to who all <EOS> it's not like with cell phones like where you have a you know nokia model x_ and then ten people make face plates for it , <EOS> we'd be just our model of pho of t remote control . <EOS>
yeah <EOS> i can see by the ears . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay , right , <EOS> it's a fluffy rabbit , blue . <EOS> rabbits don't come in blue but you know . <EOS> um okay and i like it because it's small and it's fluffy . <EOS> mm . <EOS>
um looking at the needs people specified , the problem right now is that people's remotes are not matching their operating behaviour . <EOS> people are only using ten per cent of the buttons that they have offered to them on their remote . <EOS> and what people do most often is changing the channel and changing the volume . <EOS> people also zap like to change the channel , about um sixty five per cent during an hour of use . <EOS> so we really just need to focus in on those volumes and channel changers rather than things like the audio settings , the screen settings and the channel settings , <EOS> because they're used much more infrequently <EOS> and probably just complicate what's going on . <EOS>
are we are we finished ahead of schedule ? <EOS> we might possibly have done . <EOS> cool . <EOS> alright , see you all soon . <EOS> if we've if we've finished at five minutes before the meeting's supposed to finish , then that means we get an extra five minutes for lunch . <EOS>
bonjour . <EOS> it's <EOS> it won't wake up . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i was a bit early . <EOS> like <EOS> why ? <EOS> what ? <EOS> no , <EOS> i just came in . <EOS> uh normally i was one of them . <EOS> okay . <EOS> come on . <EOS>
oh . <EOS> uh , let's just enter in the um evaluation criteria . <EOS> um unfortunately <EOS> the unit we are currently going to produce minus the extra scroll buttons , uh it's gonna cost us fourteen point six euros . <EOS> mm . <EOS> oh . <EOS> so we have to <EOS> rea sorry , <EOS> i've accidentally highlighted somehow <EOS> um . <EOS> there we go . <EOS>
but i mean the yell yeah d yellow's ugly though , <EOS> depending on the <EOS> yeah that's right , <EOS> we didn't even rea <EOS> so i think we'll have to talk to our executive managers , and see if we can get away with just the r_r_ . <EOS>
you respond to whatever you get , huh ? <EOS> okay . <EOS> um , did you do your hit <EOS> yeah , <EOS> ah , <EOS> there it is . <EOS> ta-da . <EOS> okay , <EOS> first thing i want to address is um one of the points that florence brought up , <EOS> which was uh current cost of the competition devices , <EOS> similar to the ones that stephanie uh showed us <EOS> and and they're uh twenty to sixty euros , depending on uh branding . <EOS> some of them that have a higher brand recognition are on the more expensive end . <EOS> but i think that with the current um price that we're searching for , we're well within , even on the lower end , of the uh of the market . <EOS> but i'm going to move on to more interesting um more vibrant things . <EOS>
so it has to be very robust . <EOS> okay , unbreakable . <EOS> unbreakable , yeah . <EOS> uh-huh . <EOS> yeah , we have some child lock or something , yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> and uh <EOS> it has to be nice looking , <EOS>
okay , so what's the bottleneck ? <EOS> how about we change the sale ? <EOS> double curved . <EOS> double curve . we can transform the double curve into single c yeah . <EOS> f some <EOS> something flat . <EOS> yeah , but flat <EOS> s uncurved . yeah , maybe not . <EOS>
sammy benjo . i know this name uh . <EOS> we met before . <EOS> sounds uh uh-oh . <EOS> mm uh . yeah , <EOS> it is put f_ five . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> hmm . the full page presentation , <EOS> yep . <EOS> yeah <EOS> maybe in the full page <EOS> because i i spent lots of time doing this presentation , so . <EOS>
yeah <EOS> so . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> yes yes <EOS> mo <EOS> because they are already used to that , you know , product . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yes <EOS> it's recognisable <EOS> mm mm . <EOS> and and they are skilled uh by using it . <EOS>
certainly could . yeah , yeah . <EOS> so uh yeah , <EOS> if we could uh power on and channel selection and and volume selection , wouldn't have to really <EOS> mm . <EOS> the i mean the the advantage of doing away the buttons altogether is it makes the thing cheaper . <EOS>
hmm . <EOS> and uh well one of the ideas was maybe uh use touch screen , <EOS> but s i don't know in how far that is possible , <EOS> since we are sticking to uh um infrared <EOS> and and the remote cannot receive anything , <EOS> but uh we might uh consider that . <EOS> um well , <EOS> of course i i hope this is all clear to you . <EOS> if you <EOS> you can use remote like this with all the functions , <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> well the original <EOS> i i think we should just focus on one design and one concept right now.i'm <EOS> not sure that we'll have the time and money to produce a whole array of <EOS> twenty five euros <EOS> okay . <EOS> remotes . <EOS> if this was a successful remote , we might then produce a higher end version of it , i think . <EOS>
hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> so maybe the children's remote should be like a a next step , <EOS> but maybe i dunno for ours , maybe we should <EOS> anyway you could add on for an extra package , <EOS> but on this basic one i'm reckoning that we're going for the basic model to be discussed here <EOS> and that uh you would have for future reference the possibility of adding in extra features at extra cost to take care of specialist market segments . <EOS>
it just build a mould basically and uh you know . <EOS> yeah yeah . <EOS> it's it's just a s shape so it doesn't matter . <EOS> yes exactly . <EOS> as the budget we're looking at if you build one mould i don't think that's going to make a big difference whether it's gonna be square or <EOS>
yes . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> make sure in your questionnaire to put down criticisms of both the process and the um the final results <EOS> yeah , <EOS> real reaction . <EOS> and . <EOS> i do like the martian remote . <EOS> if we could choose more than one , that would be my second choice . <EOS>
uh so , so it's really the beep or , or a light should blink . <EOS> or a b <EOS> if lost uh signal with b throw signal , you know . <EOS> should ha <EOS> yeah . <EOS> a fluorescent signal , yeah . <EOS> mm 'kay . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> what's teletext ? <EOS> um . <EOS> uh , it's a british thing . <EOS> oh . oh , <EOS> so <EOS> you don't have it in the states ? <EOS> no . <EOS> it <EOS> no . <EOS> w d could <EOS> would you care to explain it ? <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> mm . <EOS> okay . <EOS> and you mean the first layer would be spongy . <EOS> so <EOS> is it is it possible to do that ? <EOS> it would be a great idea , <EOS> but is it possible technically ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> first layer obviously spo yeah , <EOS> w it's it's like silly , but the people will really appreciate it , yeah i think . <EOS>
like a very big scroll-wheel . <EOS> okay . <EOS> maybe , i dunno . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> okay , so <EOS> we have this at the moment . <EOS> i think uh you'll get a a lot of uh volume changing when it's not wanted . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> you <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> what can you do to like make the infra-red more functional , <EOS> like why would it not be ? <EOS> i'm just wondering . <EOS> i think it's a lot to do with battery , <EOS> but that's just my <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> seven is the <EOS> i will give a a five . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> sorry . <EOS> and you ? <EOS> do you vote uh christine ? <EOS> do you also vote ? <EOS> eh ? <EOS> no , <EOS> i just want to see something <EOS>
okay yeah . <EOS> okay <EOS> so we can take this into account . <EOS> so who think it would be good to go for uh like speech recognition ? <EOS> but we don't have time to market . <EOS> yeah it will . <EOS> and also how much <EOS> uh <EOS> i think <EOS>
it could . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm . <EOS> it's like more more expensive to have shape like that . <EOS> but i don't care . you know , if we fit this requirement . <EOS> well <EOS> i'd like a shaped screen . <EOS> i think that's more important than saving a bit of money on on the t_f_t_ screen . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> then we're gonna work , you know , from each of your presentations . <EOS> we'll we'll uh talk about what we actually need as a final coming together of it all . <EOS> um and then we'll , yeah , we'll sort of conclude anything else comes up at the end of it . <EOS>
interesting . <EOS> i guess i'll go next then . <EOS> okay . <EOS> don't wanna lose all my mikes , plugged in here . <EOS> okay . <EOS> this is basically just pen practice <EOS> huh ? <EOS> okay . <EOS> oh you're much taller than me <EOS> so i'm gonna write down here . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> so you have this ? <EOS> nah . <EOS> so we have three presentations , <EOS> and i think we'll go in order of participant number here . <EOS> so we can have a look at the working design first from participant two . <EOS> that's <EOS> yes . <EOS>
oh wait , um . <EOS> uh . you need to help me . <EOS> uh-huh , and then press function . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> and f_ eight . <EOS> could you just plug it back into hers because she had <EOS> oh . oh , wait . <EOS> that's <EOS> is that it ? <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> okay , i think this is more a question of of <EOS> i i think this is more a question of of look and feel . <EOS> something that should be addressed later <EOS> . we should we should go to other for the other topics . <EOS>
really ? <EOS> right . <EOS> oh really , you've seen one before . <EOS> do you think maybe we need like further advances in that kind of area until it's worthwhile incorporating it though ? <EOS> um <EOS> i think it'd probably quite expensive to put in . <EOS> sorry , <EOS> do you mind passing me my notepad . <EOS> thanks . <EOS>
and that's on the camera . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> 'kay . <EOS> mm 'kay . <EOS> okay so we basically have battery versus cradle here ? <EOS> m battery versus cradle i think is yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> i like the kinetic . <EOS> so we have battery versus cradle <EOS>
hmm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> comes on every time you turn it on and then that's it <EOS> 'cause it is a bit much to have it like engraved on the back or something i think . <EOS> mm . true . <EOS> yeah . yeah . <EOS> i'm hoping for a subliminal maybe half a millisecond as it turns on . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> aye , cheers . <EOS> yes . <EOS> thank you . <EOS> you're welcome . <EOS> we can leave the p_c_ on i think , <EOS> yeah <EOS> and return to the <EOS> yeah , of course . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> well <EOS> i bring it to my uh personal room . <EOS>
mm-hmm , okay . <EOS> do we have more than one special colour ? <EOS> yeah , <EOS> we're using we're gonna need at least two special colours . <EOS> uh well <EOS> special colours , <EOS> isn't it ? <EOS> um . <EOS> i don't know what the se the basic colour is though . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> mm yeah , <EOS> it's <EOS> yeah . <EOS> black yellow control . <EOS> maybe the sides in yellow and the the the top in black . <EOS> yeah , mm <EOS> n not that weird , <EOS> because we definitely want to make it kind of flashy , to attract a young public . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> but who will give the scoring uh we ourself or or a third party ? <EOS> you . <EOS> according to you , <EOS> no <EOS> according to you designers , <EOS> how will feel does it uh with l_c_d_ and without l_c_d_ ? <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> um we should definitely avoid the big square block look . <EOS> that's just wrong . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm 'kay . <EOS> and um we got an email uh from i think it's the the research department , <EOS> and they've said th the voice control um can now talk back if you ask it a question . <EOS> so it sh it could be good to have them um confirm any action you take <EOS>
no <EOS> nathan's fine . <EOS> it's either nathan or participant two . <EOS> mister participant two that is . <EOS> uh . <EOS> nice . <EOS> okay . um , <EOS> basically what i'm gonna have to talk to you about today is um component design <EOS> and it's been brought to my attention that we may be somewhat limited as to what we can do <EOS> because of what our manufacturer offers , <EOS> so <EOS> basically what i'm gonna be doing is talking to you about that . <EOS>
's a very bright strawberry . <EOS> so we'll come up with a variety of trendy and exciting fruit designs for the remote control . <EOS> it's been a l <EOS> and then people will be encouraged to buy three or five of them , because they'll need to switch 'em out . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> that's right . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> data functions hidden at back . <EOS> can bring out when needed . <EOS> so th the <EOS> the detailed ones would be sort of brightness , <EOS> uh sorta <EOS> yeah . <EOS> that's right <EOS> so we're dis <EOS> so you've got which ones are gonna be on the front <EOS> and which ones are gonna be on the back . <EOS> we have to decide . <EOS>
yeah , <EOS> i think isn't , this has to be something like isn't overwhelmed . <EOS> it's not overwhelmed . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , indeed . <EOS> true . <EOS> okay , <EOS> a one , <EOS> because we designed for that , <EOS> huh ? <EOS> yep . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> okay . wonderful , well done . <EOS> do you want to use the wipe the m the wiper and wipe it off ? <EOS> okay . <EOS> and mister aesthetics designer do you wanna go next ? <EOS> aesthetic yep , sure . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> okay , <EOS> okay , great . <EOS> okay . yeah yeah . <EOS> go ahead . <EOS> mm-hmm . sure . <EOS> okay . yeah yeah . yeah . <EOS> could evaluate the <EOS> okay . <EOS> so you can say fancy , <EOS> handy . <EOS> handy . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> and the third most important aspect in the ta to take into consideration is that it should be easy to use , <EOS> like it shouldn't be too much co complicated , <EOS> there shouldn't be too many buttons on this mobi uh remote control , <EOS> it shouldn't be too complicated uh like this way . <EOS> and it should be uh <EOS> and customers should be provided with manuals that is easy to understand in their local language , something . <EOS> so that they could know how to use these remote controls . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> otherwise we are just like others in the market . <EOS> so anyway that is the first , user interface could be of more than one type , <EOS> and uh yeah that means we can do the on-line changes which which cannot be done now actually . <EOS> so apart from the speech , we can have the scroll kind of thing with the buttons . <EOS> now for buttons , normal requirements like bit coding and all those things are required . <EOS> and for voice , limited vocabulary automatic speech recognition system is required and we require a microphone also to be sitting there on the remote . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> what is it ? <EOS> i think it's a it's a great animal . <EOS> it's a it's a giraffe . <EOS> a giraffe okay . <EOS> yeah <EOS> i see a long neck <EOS> but <EOS> yeah , <EOS> that's a <EOS> it's more like a dinosaur . <EOS>
that'll it literally would just be a button . <EOS> we might have to <EOS> yeah . <EOS> that's too expensive <EOS> isn't it ? <EOS> it looks like almost nothing <EOS> mm . oh <EOS> good call , <EOS> i missed that . <EOS> i i mean it's not on here , <EOS> but um . <EOS>
ah would buy , yeah . <EOS> massively , yeah . <EOS> yeah . okay . <EOS> uh you have been in milan a couple of times , so . <EOS> and you said the lowest . <EOS> actually there were a lot of <EOS> this is a battery . <EOS>
well that's the thing , i'm i'm not sure um <EOS> uh th because on the the company website , uh what does it say <EOS> 'bout putting the fashion in electronics . <EOS> uh something <EOS> yeah , <EOS> i mean do they is that something they want actually written on it , <EOS> 'cause it's quite long . <EOS>
huh not so big like yeah . <EOS> no uh , not too much buttons or mm . <EOS> yeah , not too much buttons and <EOS> should it be , y you know these uh remote controls where um they are what they call a universal ret remote control <EOS> so y you can decide that now it's the remote control for the television , <EOS> then it's the remote control for the the sound system , or for your refrigerator <EOS> whatever <EOS> i dunno if it's <EOS>
wow . <EOS> yeah , for favourite animals . <EOS> it's gonna be not my favourite one but the one i can draw . <EOS> and it's gonna be you'll try to guess . <EOS> wow . <EOS> complex . <EOS> wow . <EOS> huh ? <EOS> a cat . <EOS>
no <EOS> they will record through that . <EOS> there's a sensor over there <EOS> which is going to record the strokes that you make . <EOS> mm . mm . <EOS> but for us it's just like a normal whiteboard . <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> 'kay . <EOS>
so now uh we will have three presentations . <EOS> so the conceptual specification by industrial designer , <EOS> the specification of the u_i_ by or u_i_ <EOS> okay . <EOS> and uh the last point is uh trend watching by market expert . <EOS> abdul al-hasred is my name . <EOS>
okay , okay . yes . <EOS> i dunno if you remember what you had to say or <EOS> i can say it to you without . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> so <EOS> yeah , <EOS> maybe we can first come to <EOS> no , <EOS> i think it will be more interesting to start with uh <EOS>
okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> those really sounds very good . <EOS> nothing else to add ? <EOS> that's right . <EOS> it seems to be falling over . <EOS> i l yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i like i like it . <EOS> maybe the the thing that convince me the less is the the multifunctional buttons . <EOS> looks a bit <EOS>
and um i'm not sure about the buttons being in the shape of fruit though . <EOS> no vegetables . <EOS> yeah , i don't know how we incorporate <EOS> . <EOS> we don't have to follow every trend , i guess . <EOS> maybe make it like fruity colours or something . <EOS> some sort . <EOS>
like because there's like one interface right here and then because it's not gonna be on the same plane when you press the button . <EOS> there's gonna have to be additional signals on the sides . <EOS> so is that gonna be an extra one on each side ? <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> so so are you having the stand-by on the front , then ? <EOS> we can send out a flier with the device saying that you shouldn't leave it on stand-by . <EOS> i think you probably should . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> but a little bit smaller . <EOS> compromise . <EOS>
okay , the next meeting will be in thirty minutes . <EOS> i think you all <EOS> did you get uh notices on your computer for this ? <EOS> okay so well , you got the notice um <EOS> uh . the working design , i guess that's the function <EOS> i_d_ uh who is this ? <EOS> the industrial designer that's you . <EOS>
i'll wait until you're all um hooked up . <EOS> oh good grief . <EOS> 'kay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> oh . <EOS> put it on in that way . <EOS> thanks . <EOS> oops . <EOS> okay . <EOS> mm . <EOS> welcome back everybody , hope you've had fun . <EOS>
okay , cool . <EOS> hmm . it is not giving anything . <EOS> shared documents . <EOS> and i will tr <EOS> getting strings of um information , <EOS> i'll try and forward any specific to anybody in particular , <EOS> as soon as i get them now , rather than <EOS> i was about to sort of tell you about the changes before the meeting , and then the meeting turned up , so <EOS>
ah . <EOS> the mexican food is okay , <EOS> it's just not good <EOS> like <EOS> and yeah it's like two bucks , <EOS> like literally two bucks for this massive <EOS> i miss <EOS> yeah <EOS> good call on that . <EOS> mm . <EOS> right . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> where you from in san diego ? <EOS>
right okay . okay . <EOS> think it's ten minutes left . <EOS> ten . <EOS> 'kay . <EOS> ability to stop remotes from being lost or to find them once they are lost . <EOS> um . okay . <EOS> special colour . <EOS> special colour . <EOS> mm mm four ? <EOS> three ? mm . <EOS>
what this button for ? <EOS> this is a teletext button . <EOS> so once you press that then you get teletext <EOS> and you can use the the channel selector scroll wheel as uh <EOS> okay . <EOS> to navigate it through th through teletext . <EOS> but if you want to go to page seven hundred ? <EOS>
no <EOS> but for this one it's twelve euro . <EOS> no , for that one also . <EOS> there are twelve ? <EOS> so , <EOS> one , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight , nine , <EOS> t <EOS> yeah <EOS> that's a scroll . <EOS>
yeah maybe on the side . i mean if the if the microphone is good . <EOS> yeah but then it's possible that you cover it with your hand so <EOS> true . <EOS> yeah okay . so on the on the top is better . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i think that top is the best option . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> right . <EOS> right . <EOS> right . <EOS> um , i definitely have to agree with that last comment . <EOS> and we're still not <EOS> then we don't have to deal with this battery issue nearly as much either , <EOS> we can stick with what we've already got . <EOS>
why ? <EOS> because it's simpler ? <EOS> because because the the range where you can use it is fair . <EOS> it's okay i think . <EOS> and the price is fairly cheap for this . <EOS> well , depends . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm . <EOS> okay . it's a a price matter . <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
oh well we also have to determine in some manner how to switch between modes , between going through your favourites list and just hitting up one , up two . <EOS> making it last . <EOS> or we go directional up we go we go this we go this we go this way for one , we go this way for the other . <EOS>
count it . <EOS> you got excel to count . <EOS> the number of <EOS> oh okay . <EOS> well <EOS> i dra <EOS> uh danny , danny , i'll do that , <EOS> because i draw the uh <EOS> ah , okay , cool . <EOS> huh ? yeah ? oh , yea yeah , you design it . um <EOS>
what about um <EOS> oh , colour , yeah . <EOS> well the obvious thing is a banana , i guess . <EOS> oh i i <EOS> maybe yeah . <EOS> i thought about a a pear , for example . <EOS> you know the pear , is like that and it's it's easy to to have in in hand <EOS> and uh <EOS>
and it's just to , it's just to playback something ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so actually that was a bad example , <EOS> 'cause it doesn't actually ask how do you want your coffee because it can't really understand the response , so . <EOS> yeah yeah . <EOS> so this is not s really to do to to do control . <EOS>
kind of pull out of the side . <EOS> mm . <EOS> ooh . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> 'cause then 's like people who don't wanna ever look at them , never even have to see them <EOS> and if you like get the instruction manual that comes with it and you just don't even read it then you'll never even know that those things can pull out . <EOS> and you're a happy person <EOS> and everyone else doesn't have to have like two remotes , <EOS> one that has the easy ones and one that has <EOS>
it's not <EOS> yeah . <EOS> ah , hmm . <EOS> right . <EOS> it's been been around for a long time <EOS> it's just it's not very well advertised as to how to use it and things . <EOS> no it's not <EOS> um but i think if awareness was kind of brought to the forefront about that <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> so , <EOS> if you have questions . <EOS> oh . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> know what time is it ? <EOS> no . <EOS> no . <EOS> it's okay ? <EOS> you know your job ? <EOS> you know your job ? <EOS> yeah , it's okay . <EOS> we have an idea yeah . <EOS> i have an idea of my job <EOS> so yeah so . yeah . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> i think we'd have to decide between 'em definitely . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> to be honest , we have the capa we have the design in-house , <EOS> i mean we've we've come up with this , with this new voice <EOS> we're using it for our coffee machines already . <EOS>
oh yeah ? <EOS> i did not knew that . <EOS> yeah . if you also up on a computer in a strange position . <EOS> okay <EOS> so you we have to make it uh more ergonomic yeah . <EOS> ergonomic . <EOS> but uh . <EOS> have to say ha ha . <EOS>
one . <EOS> one . <EOS> two . <EOS> four point one ? <EOS> one . <EOS> two . <EOS> five . <EOS> two . <EOS> four point two . <EOS> two . <EOS> three . <EOS> four . <EOS> two <EOS> and four point three . <EOS> two . <EOS>
yeah , <EOS> i i would say definitely , <EOS> i mean i mean i mean <EOS> the the idea of having it sort of articulated i th <EOS> there would be basically two points of articulation . w um one below and one above the m the uh the main sort of grip . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> i in a few days you will be ha <EOS> in in few ye coming years you might even have a system where you have a separate uh sitting setup box <EOS> and uh you have uh um something like uh uh you do you do you <EOS> suppose you are not able to watch some programme and actually it downloading all the time for you <EOS> and uh you can just <EOS> you know uh <EOS> when you come back you could just switch on that thing and uh watch a program . <EOS> in that case you want to browse faster , browse slow , you want to have those kind of functionalities . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> i'd call these quite uh minimalist , <EOS> yes , <EOS> a plain , simple , clean design . <EOS> simple and plain , <EOS> but i mean i do see what <EOS> it is heavily reliant on appearance instead of pure functionality , <EOS> so in that respect it is quite fancy . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> we don't even have uh speakers here . <EOS> the <EOS> like uh <EOS> we <EOS> uh what about speakers and transmitters and stuff like that ? have we factored that in ? <EOS> mm . <EOS> uh no , we haven't , not <EOS> transmitter , receiver , speakers . plus the extra device itself that's gonna be on a t_v_ . <EOS> is that gonna be a button , or <EOS>
what do you mean by the circular section ? <EOS> like all of that bottom bit ? <EOS> j yeah yeah yeah j yeah <EOS> just this little bit <EOS> is that <EOS> i think that's still um a video remote part , <EOS> so maybe we could get rid of that as well . <EOS>
i dunno . <EOS> a different extension of a <EOS> of the actual project rather than the product ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> a project ? <EOS> is is <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah 'cause we're talking about leadership , teamwork . <EOS> so wh how we actually went round uh about doing it . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah . yeah . <EOS> i would <EOS> it would probably . <EOS> right . <EOS> okay . <EOS> i mean there's sky remote controls and everything . <EOS> they're kind of moulded <EOS> and look a bit different , <EOS> and the telewest remote controls are silver plastic , <EOS> which looks a bit smarter , <EOS> so yeah i guess that's stuff we can think about . <EOS>
it should shouldn't be . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> uh . <EOS> bit like this kind of rubber . <EOS> this uh <EOS> yeah , something like this , yeah . <EOS> but it's quite hard , this . <EOS> yeah it's quite hard <EOS> but you can press it in . <EOS> it's feels kind s spongy . <EOS>
oh okay , you made some criteria . okay , cool . <EOS> okay . <EOS> you have some usability criteria or <EOS> okay . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> uh no , uh all criterias we just argue about . <EOS> uh <EOS> oh . <EOS> in the bottom . <EOS>
um they're they're specially made for the for the mobile phones , <EOS> but they come with a charger , <EOS> i mean you could you could bundle a charger in with it but <EOS> well they la they they last quite a long time , <EOS> and if you had uh when you <EOS> th the thing that you get with mobile house phones , you sit it in its charger when you're not using it or t at night or something , <EOS> but it doesn't really matter 'cause it never really runs out <EOS> 'cause it lasts a long time once it is charged . <EOS> um , something like that should reduce the size of it . <EOS>
yeah <EOS> and i guess th th the question th th that you're being asked right now is whether is the dock enough of a unique feature to be able to go out and sell that a a as a a very different product , <EOS> or do we really need the scroll wheel as well ? <EOS> because the scroll wheel comes at quite a cost . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> so um you know it's just a matter of working out space . <EOS> so i guess three things , um cost , um complexity , and the size . <EOS> these are the three things that um will have an impact on you . <EOS> so just go through it in the components . <EOS> um these are the options that are available to you , <EOS> um i'm not very sure about the voice thing 'cause i got another email and it was in fact quite sketchy on what n the voice options are . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> okay . <EOS> would it be possible to have the rechargeable idea ? <EOS> is that is that gonna mark up a lot ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> uh . <EOS> or a little base station or something , . <EOS> yeah , yeah , we could do that too . <EOS> um , i hadn't thought of that . <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
you know ? <EOS> pro specially we should <EOS> next project we should take l like that . <EOS> so , <EOS> that's the cat . <EOS> oh . <EOS> okay . so . <EOS> it's not a cat , <EOS> it's a dog . <EOS> yes . <EOS> so . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> so , <EOS> have a scroll for volume ? <EOS> f <EOS> or for all those secret functions ? <EOS> f <EOS> when you get on the on-screen menu of all your functions that your remote could do for you without the buttons and you could have a scroll wheel to go through those menus . <EOS>
is <EOS> one point nine or something ? <EOS> i don't know these things . <EOS> um , between one and two . <EOS> it's <EOS> yeah . <EOS> between one and two . <EOS> between <EOS> okay . <EOS> um . <EOS> so that's pretty fantastic . <EOS> close to two . <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
i okay . <EOS> yeah ? <EOS> so <EOS> choose a colour , <EOS> choose a pen width <EOS> and draw <EOS> a <EOS> you don't have to change the colour and the pen width during uh the drawing . <EOS> or <EOS> save it . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> you have to save it . <EOS>
so <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so <EOS> okay . <EOS> the password may simply uh or uh i identification code may simply solve this problem . <EOS> a specific uh remote control has a specific f <EOS> yeah but we we don't have to think uh about this <EOS> because i think as a function designer that we will use the already made uh circuits which we probably bu buy . <EOS> it's worth to buy . <EOS> and they have these problems solved so . <EOS> so we don't have to think about these . <EOS>
sorry . <EOS> on a little print plate <EOS> uh which uh makes uh uh a connection <EOS> that uh <EOS> gives the chips , <EOS> uh which is uh mounted beneath those uh that plastic of a rubber button . <EOS> uh senses that a connection has been made , <EOS> and know <EOS> and knows what button you pressed , becau uh for example the the volume up or volume down button . <EOS> um uh the the chip uh makes a morse code uh like uh signal <EOS> which uh then is si uh signalled to uh several transistors <EOS> which makes <EOS> uh which sends the signal to a little let . <EOS> you know what a let is ? <EOS> okay . <EOS> and that makes uh the the infra-red lights signal <EOS> which is sent to the television set . <EOS> uh which has a sensor in it to uh sense uh the signal of the infra-red . <EOS>
and therefore um have a successful uh conclusion to the day . um <EOS> mm-hmm , okay . <EOS> and you'll be doing uh various designs uh throughout the day to meet this end . <EOS> so we've got tool training . <EOS> try out whiteboard . <EOS> uh . so we will um . <EOS> right so everyone's to uh supposedly uh draw their favourite animal over on the white board over there . <EOS> i guess this is uh make sure the whiteboard works . <EOS> so uh i don't know who wishes to go first . <EOS> do you wish to go f have a first bash at uh whatever . <EOS>
okay good . <EOS> so maybe you can go ahead ? <EOS> yeah no , it's what i already said . <EOS> okay . <EOS> thanks . um . <EOS> okay , i'll give the floor . <EOS> so you are user interface guy . <EOS> okay . <EOS> so you're three ? <EOS>
yeah but uh um <EOS> and then of course we're going to get th anyone who's older than thirty five who wants to look young and hip and trendy and has the money , <EOS> then they'll they'll still go for the same advertising . <EOS> yeah , yeah sure , yeah , yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> don't think i'd want it to feel like a banana . <EOS> well it could be like mobiles that just you just put a cover . <EOS> a vegetable . <EOS> an orange . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> if it's a small thing , you c instead of creating an object for it that looks like a banana , <EOS> which frankly i'm not particularly fond of , <EOS> um you could just have covers and then your mobile f it's like a mobile phone thing . <EOS> you know you had there was a time when they had all these different covers for mobiles . <EOS>
don't panic . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> so then i will ask the user interf interface designer to to think about the point we discussed like the number of buttons , the the fact that is lighted or not , things like that , and what would be convenient for the user . <EOS>
alright . <EOS> i dunno . <EOS> i gu i guess we'll take lunch in about uh half an hour . <EOS> or i guess we'll be taking lunch shortly <EOS> and then then in about half an hour after that we'll probably have another meeting . <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
oh <EOS> my name's andrew <EOS> i'm a i'm the market research person for this uh for this meeting and this uh project for creating this new remote control <EOS> and uh yeah i'll be uh presenting information statistics on what people want to want to uh get from this new design , <EOS> what people want to like and from a fashion point of view and the practicality point of view . <EOS>
no i imagine there'd be sort of a hatch door , <EOS> yeah um like on a normal remote . <EOS> just like any other one . <EOS> okay . yeah . <EOS> right . <EOS> so it would probably either in the f <EOS> no it can't be in the front 'cause the i_r_'s right there , <EOS> but it'd be on one of the sides probably . <EOS>
did you get my email with the slides ? <EOS> ah . <EOS> tricky . <EOS> i guess i have to change the pen <EOS> otherwise . will be completely different . <EOS> dunno . <EOS> maybe they're supposed the pen's supposed to go over the seats . <EOS> might be seat floor rather than person . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> put it back . <EOS>
yep . <EOS> that doesn't really look like him , actually . <EOS> he looks more like a pig , actually . <EOS> ah well . <EOS> i see a dog in there . <EOS> yep . <EOS> do you ? <EOS> oh that's very good of you . <EOS> now i see a rooster . <EOS>
go back . <EOS> i think we just discuss it . <EOS> discuss , sure . <EOS> previous . <EOS> alright . <EOS> who want who would like to go first ? <EOS> we think we got stifled for cri creativity by the company itself , in restricting us only to using a t_v_ remote , initially . <EOS>
great . <EOS> okay . <EOS> i don't think they're scrolling . <EOS> no . <EOS> they're just buttons . <EOS> right , yeah . <EOS> and then <EOS> yeah , the buttons . <EOS> on off switch will be here <EOS> and as you've noticed on our prototype um they've ended up with a curvature kind of , <EOS> by concave sort of thing , <EOS> except for , you know , can't see underneath . <EOS> so i'm hoping that when we get to production we can actually make them like that , <EOS> because they're very <EOS>
mm . <EOS> this is the question . <EOS> is it useful ? <EOS> probably not . <EOS> it's a questi yeah , it's a trade-off . <EOS> yes . <EOS> w in my opinion we should have only useful thing <EOS> and because apparently they want the simpler it's is better . <EOS>
yeah <EOS> but for instance when you change channels you can have you can just go to the next one or go to channel twenty five . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm . <EOS> and that's already more complex to go to channel twenty five . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> you do this ? <EOS>
yes . <EOS> divides us <EOS> yeah . yeah . <EOS> yeah . exactly . <EOS> at um twelve fifty euros per <EOS> well . <EOS> well who knows if we get a really good designer maybe we can do that . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> we certainly can try to <EOS> i agree with her that to market something successfully it should do some more things . <EOS> that's right . <EOS>
so if we go with just the <EOS> i'm sure . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay so <EOS> yeah but you know the the average frequency of pushing buttons , it's about <EOS> well it depends if it's a remote control th <EOS> it's about eighty eighty eighty pushes per hour , or something like that . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> excellent . <EOS> so , um . <EOS> rose , do you think you can give me a hand with this ? <EOS> yes , absolutely . <EOS> ah <EOS> i can never tell which way to turn these things . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> lefty loosey , righty tighty , <EOS> right ? <EOS> lefty loosey , righty tighty . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> and the led . <EOS> no , <EOS> you have uh it is <EOS> uh the current uh controllers are all black and plastic . <EOS> you have to look at that image of the ipod . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> but i i it should be round in in shape . <EOS> so <EOS>
okay , yeah . <EOS> can you explain what you want us to write there ? <EOS> sorry ? <EOS> how it how conforms to the current trends ? <EOS> yeah , again the the fashion trends , <EOS> this also like whether it it will be fashionable to have these products in the uh as a fruit shape or something . <EOS> uh . <EOS>
yeah , <EOS> and do we put an l_c_d_ display ? <EOS> because it was important for young customers if you remember . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i think it's only put on if cou have multi function . <EOS> if you do not multi function then there is no p point in having l_c_d_ . <EOS> just increase the cost . <EOS> the user does not have an advantage really . <EOS>
well , <EOS> we already have research backing voice recognition as you know fiscally solvent . <EOS> but uh i i i personally would tend to another direction <EOS> but if that's what's gonna sell i think that's what we need to go with <EOS> and maybe we can table this touch screen for our next model . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> and how <EOS> pof . <EOS> we could use velcro . <EOS> yeah , maybe . <EOS> or uh ma maybe a magnetic <EOS> yes , yeah it's a good idea . <EOS> thing . <EOS> magnetic . <EOS> ma magnetic oh . <EOS> mm . yeah or a yeah it can is <EOS> it can be a plastic cover uh sticking to the to the all the stuff like uh with magnetic p uh magnetic uh magnetic uh materials in the border , so it's it sticks like refrigerator door , completely . <EOS>
true . <EOS> making it just an option ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm . right . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i was thinking uh are we still thinking about this screen <EOS> sorry . <EOS> go ahead . <EOS> oh go ahead . the uh <EOS> if we're gonna do this touch pad screen thing , it would be still , do we know if that's an option technically right now to that ? <EOS> okay . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> um so <EOS> we've got our opening , <EOS> our our agenda is the opening , uh acquaintance which we've kinda done . uh tool training , project plan discussion and then closing . <EOS> uh grand total of twenty five minutes we have here . <EOS>
depends on the screen . <EOS> if you make the screen vertical it doesn't matter . <EOS> if you make it uh in a rectangle <EOS> th <EOS> right well <EOS> if we make it like this , i think if you <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i so it's it's it's it's <EOS>
okay . <EOS> right , who's got experiences with remote controls then ? <EOS> pretty much everybody . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , i think we've all got <EOS> uh . <EOS> um . <EOS> is this a t_v_ one we are supposed to make ? <EOS> yeah . yeah it's a t_v_ remote control . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> it migh it <EOS> it'll need uh more than a conventional one , <EOS> it won't be uh just <EOS> maybe you might use a a_a_ battery actually . <EOS> what do you say , mael ? <EOS> for this one it's a normal battery . <EOS>
without l_c_d_ . <EOS> s s oh i think it's better to have this without l_c_d_ . <EOS> and to improve the the look . <EOS> as our programme manager s pro project manager says that without l_c_d_ it is going to reduce the cost also , <EOS> and it's going to be much simpler to use . <EOS>
so <EOS> i i like i like this idea of just having buttons for the features that you use most often . <EOS> so you'd need a few buttons to select your favourite channels . <EOS> i mean most people , when they watch t_v_ , they have two hundred and fifty channels on their t_v_ <EOS> and they watch of 'bout four of them at the most . <EOS> so , <EOS> you have buttons for your favourite channel , <EOS> changing the volume , <EOS> which is something you do all the time when you're watching t_v_ , <EOS> and the button to switch it off , in case you get bored . <EOS> um other features , things like adjusting the brightness , tuning the t_v_ , <EOS> uh i don't know what else you do with a t_v_ . <EOS> um but these are these are all necessary functions . <EOS> uh you can't have a t <EOS> there's no point having a television that you can't tune or that you can't set the contrast , <EOS> so we need to find a way of including these somehow . <EOS> um and one other suggestions i'd make is to in is to include in a menu system , a bit like on the ipod . <EOS> so <EOS> we'd either have a small l_c_d_ display on the device itself , <EOS> or uh have a dis a menu display that comes up on your television <EOS> and can b be controlled through the device . <EOS> and that would allow you to access access the advanced features <EOS> uh whilst keeping a very small and simple set of buttons for the features that you use most often . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> that was something <EOS> like <EOS> in order to talk about that we would've had to have actual knowledge about circuit boards and things like <EOS> about <EOS> yeah . <EOS> well <EOS> the problem was , even when we just were creating from the excel file , there wasn't like a option to select to somehow have it included , <EOS> so there was no <EOS> we could be like yeah , it has it included . <EOS> there was no way for us to have <EOS>
but you guys felt that you could keep the , yeah , suspension of disbelief kind of like like the role and the okay ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i <EOS> except for a couple moments where it just got out of hand <EOS> and i knew we were all lying through our teeth , <EOS> other than that <EOS>
if you take your time too long i will uh eventually uh <EOS> warn you . <EOS> well , <EOS> i'm going to give a presentation abut some of the technical functions of these design and uh usability functions . <EOS> um what's my opinion about what's most important to combine the design , technical possibilities and the user friendliness in one , <EOS> so if you um going to design a remote that looks good , that shouldn't weigh over the uh if it's possible to make , of course , but also the user friendliness , <EOS> so tha that's that's some of the main points . <EOS> and another one is um the use um of many functions will will make it more difficult , <EOS> so use as as little functions as possible <EOS> or at least don't display them all at once on the same remote . <EOS> if you have fifty functions you don't want fifty buttons uh t uh to be shown at the same time , <EOS> 'cause when you visit an internet uh site you don't want fifty links uh to see , <EOS> but maybe use a hierarch hierarchy uh structure . <EOS>
well it depends though well it depends . <EOS> if we we don't <EOS> unless we have some input some video input to the t_v_ or we have control over the t_v_ then we can't actually display that . <EOS> like if we if we produce the t_v_s then then yeah we can put you know menus up up there , <EOS> but otherwise we need to actually have some kind of something sitting in between the video signal and the and the t_v_ to superimpose those those menus . <EOS> so that's an extra <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> mm . <EOS> n that way <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> and if um if you'd save the more complicated functions maybe for separate remotes that you wouldn't need to use every day . <EOS> mm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> okay , <EOS> so maybe have like one remote that has the main functions on , off , channel changing , volume , and another rote remote with all the special things . <EOS> because that is one thing that um remotes tend to have buttons that the t_v_s no longer have as well . <EOS> so like you have to have them somewhere , <EOS> 'cause you're gonna m need those special functions occasionally . <EOS> um but not necessarily on the m the normal remote . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> mm . 'cause i only remember to charge my cell phone uh when battery dies . <EOS> and that's pretty much <EOS> yeah . yeah , <EOS> when it turns itself off , that's when i plug it in , <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> when it <EOS> yeah , <EOS> wh when it's died is a problem . <EOS> yeah , yeah , <EOS> yeah , so uh um <EOS> what so wh what what do we think about the um the the permanent mm battery ? <EOS>
we'll get round to that later . <EOS> my name is chiara and i'm the marketing expert . <EOS> okay . <EOS> i forgot to s say i'm the project manager but i figured you all knew that already , <EOS> um so . <EOS> i'm stephanie and i am the user interface designer . <EOS>
it is a turn off t turn off button , maybe . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah , yeah yeah . that's <EOS> okay . <EOS> so it's coarse to fine design . <EOS> that's very technologic , so . yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay the uh th this looks better . yeah . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm . <EOS> mm , mm-hmm . <EOS> that to what extent people do it or not , <EOS> but if they've at least got a a good selection of um covers that they can use anyway , <EOS> and uh and if if we can keep them , you know , rolling , <EOS> then uh <EOS> you know , <EOS> so they can get them in the supermarket when they go down to um a any of the famous supermarkets , <EOS> i won't mention any mention any names , <EOS> um it's uh it's good for the supermarket <EOS> and it's good for us <EOS> and it hopefully makes them feel better . <EOS>
well <EOS> we have to make a decision now , that's it . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yes . <EOS> so uh uh <EOS> having an l_c_d_ s display is just uh uh have very very limited amount of buttons . <EOS> is that acceptable ? <EOS> ca can i have can the functions be implement in an <EOS>
i dunno who and whatnot . <EOS> so exactly . <EOS> so um we've got a i in this in this uh drawing he uh in this example here , this is a eighteen pin um uh chip i dunno . <EOS> uh it's two double a_ batteries . <EOS> this is pretty standard remote . <EOS>
so does everyone want to say who they are ? <EOS> that seem sensible ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i'm robin . <EOS> i'm the marketing manager . <EOS> i'm louisa . <EOS> i'm the user interface designer . <EOS> i'm nick . <EOS> i am the industrial designer . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> bu <EOS> yeah . <EOS> but uh yeah but no th but the yeah the the the <EOS> mm . <EOS> . <EOS> the final product would actually stand up , yeah . <EOS> yeah , yeah , yeah , <EOS> i mean it it's uh wouldn't <EOS> wouldn't do that , indeed yeah . <EOS> but th th but th yeah th b the <EOS> these were all minor minor uh minor details , <EOS> i think the uh the basic concept i i is is absolutely bang on <EOS> and the i <EOS> it certainly meets our criteria of being uh of you know looking different . <EOS> um , so <EOS> good that's that that's excellent . <EOS> um right <EOS> let us um <EOS>
yeah <EOS> well it <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i d i d i d i think it it in my mind it doesn't seem like something that oh i'd really want uh because of that fact . <EOS> but i i don't know , that's just my opinion . <EOS>
i will give i will <EOS> seven is the ma the maximum ? <EOS> no , seven is false and one is true . <EOS> i'll gi <EOS> i'll give two or three . <EOS> three , it's okay . <EOS> three , three . <EOS> three is fine for me . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> well , i dunno if the traditional user is gonna buy a a banana remote <EOS> oh , yeah . <EOS> that's that's another issue which i didn't think of . <EOS> in the first place , you know . <EOS> y i mean you need to kind of keep it um <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> little bit more if it's with extra features . <EOS> yeah , extra features . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> it <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , s s speech is a important extra feature i think <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah , yeah . that's right . <EOS>
well , did you not say it was the the adults that were going for the the voice recognition ? <EOS> sort of the the older group . <EOS> uh , yeah , it's the <EOS> yep . <EOS> it does it does fit with the market that we're sort of identifying , <EOS> in terms of <EOS>
s yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> yep . <EOS> so if we continue , <EOS> we'll look at the findings . <EOS> next screen . <EOS> which means that uh if we have a target of two million would the company has to take twenty five percent of the market in the first year , <EOS> which is actually a tremendous amount . <EOS>
what ? <EOS> bling . <EOS> so . <EOS> okay . <EOS> first question . <EOS> is the design fancy enough ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> well <EOS> project manager , what do you think ? <EOS> well <EOS> it's looks fancy , especially with the green colour . and the the curves which we decided , <EOS> huh ? <EOS>
the best function for the user . so uh and i just sort of like thought about it myself and looked on the internet . <EOS> and okay so basically um i think i uh like it is really important that we sort of get this done in a user friendly and fashionable way . <EOS> um so i think things like uh <EOS> you know keeping buttons together that like close together that um are used in the same way , <EOS> uh <EOS> or um maybe that making 'em the same colour , <EOS> keeping the number of buttons the uh leas you know to a minimum , <EOS> and also things like is it is it um is it uh can you c y small enough large enough <EOS> i'm not sure we c <EOS> i guess we would need to do some research about , i would , about what size is appropriate and that sort of thing , <EOS> um but basically we need to make sure that it turns on and off the t_v_ . <EOS> does it have like capacity to change the channels ? <EOS> um does it do <EOS> or do we need to have like functions for cable or v_c_r_ ? <EOS> and then , is it findable , <EOS> and uh how do we wanna do that ? <EOS> and um <EOS>
um and that they often lose the <EOS> it's easy to lose a remote . <EOS> um which were all things we were thinking we would wanna make it simple . um <EOS> and uh some sort of locator . <EOS> either a button or tracking device . um <EOS> and that it should look different than what's out there . <EOS> um <EOS> kind of mixed mixed response on the speech recognition . <EOS> the younger people said they wanted it , older people did not . <EOS> um uh i think we decided that um the expense was not necessarily worth it , <EOS> and that it was probably a gimmick , that um would increasingly wear on the consumers' nerves . um <EOS> then the user interface designer um explored some of the technical functions of the remote . <EOS> um the simple versus the um the complex . <EOS> the simple one being better for a user , the complex better for an engineer . um <EOS> um and some personal preferences that were found in that would be that it should be a user-oriented remote , something simple . <EOS> um and that we didn't wanna go with a universal remote , because uh increasing cost and increasing complexity . <EOS> um we would just have a t_v_ remote . <EOS> um and that we should also focus on the appearance of the remote . <EOS> have it s be something that looks different . <EOS> and finally our um industrial designer uh gave us a rundown of how the remote will work . <EOS> um from energy source , um uh what we would use . <EOS> batteries because we don't wanna have a a cable . um <EOS> how that would power the remote and the lamp . <EOS> if we were to to have one . <EOS> uh um the user interface then would connect to a chip , which would work with the infrared controls uh to send the signal to the t_v_ . um <EOS> i believe then we came up with a couple of ideas for what we think the design of the remote will be . um <EOS> um something that will fit into uh easily into someone's hand . <EOS> and with a , just a few buttons . <EOS> just the basics . <EOS> and with a scrolling um function also . <EOS> okay <EOS> and i will leave that , leave it at that . <EOS> so <EOS> marketing ? <EOS> we're watching trends . <EOS> i suppose that you can have this . <EOS>
i like that idea . <EOS> yeah <EOS> so . <EOS> yes . <EOS> okay . so <EOS> i can take i think mine now there . <EOS> okay so <EOS> voila . <EOS> hmm i can take mine it's okay , <EOS> voila , <EOS> mm so mm . <EOS>
mm . mm-hmm . mm . <EOS> so your you think we should go for a more u universal high-performance <EOS> well , <EOS> we can't , with the price range . <EOS> we we're not building a universal remote , <EOS> we're not building a high end product . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> we want to have a <EOS> no , i don't know if this is a good idea . <EOS> we want to have a a general remote control for everything . <EOS> no no no . <EOS> we w it seems that we no want to have a t_v_ remote control . <EOS> from the management board i receive an email . <EOS> cos it would be costly <EOS>
well <EOS> no <EOS> i think w we should just , we should then just design one um <EOS> remote . <EOS> one remote , <EOS> but it would have to be fancy with either the wood cover or the plastic one . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> so , <EOS> but that shouldn't be too much of a problem . <EOS>
oh we s hadn't discussed it last time . <EOS> 'cause if we're gonna have to ha if we have this it just seems like in order to have someone going around and using the um the wheel <EOS> you need a screen for it ? <EOS> you <EOS> it seems like you would need a screen . <EOS>
mm . mm . <EOS> an interesting thing that this report has brought up <EOS> is that um fifty fifty percent of users report that the remote control gets lost a lot of the time in the room , <EOS> so some way of some way of locating the remote control would be very useful to a lot of users . um . <EOS> thirty four percent said it takes too long to learn to use a remote control , <EOS> they want something that's easier to use straight away , more intuitive perhaps . <EOS>
. <EOS> okay um <EOS> new ideas found ? <EOS> mm . what did we find for new ideas ? <EOS> people should really base their remotes on fruits and vegetables . <EOS> definitely . <EOS> or or at least be c p creative enough to think of toggle switches mm <EOS>
yeah , <EOS> and keeping the l_c_d_ screen out . <EOS> uh . <EOS> was that you ? <EOS> um that was your bit's covered , <EOS> i just dele i just accidentally deleted what i was supposed to say next . <EOS> huh ? <EOS> oh yeah that was that was it . <EOS>
huh . <EOS> uh-huh . <EOS> ah ! good . <EOS> 'kay you can go so . <EOS> so there are other frustrations expressed by users , <EOS> so they said uh they lost uh often the remote control in in the room so they want to have a way to to <EOS>
second thing is <EOS> yeah and second question is like , a mobile you can change the cover , <EOS> you call it a skin or whatever . <EOS> so in this case if you're looking at like a customer can change the colour like from green , parrot green to chilli red or something like that . <EOS> so is that feature available in like uh titanium , <EOS> or it's like only specific to plastic or <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay we shou we should discuss this la later after after after this this uh slide . <EOS> this is a this is a this is a a very important uh issue in discussion . <EOS> okay , next . <EOS> uh that finished ? <EOS>
yeah . pushbuttons . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> electronics ? <EOS> yeah , <EOS> maybe we wanna decide on what electronics to use <EOS> the advanced chip i think is easiest to implement uh for the production , 'cause they they can print it better . <EOS> um <EOS> yeah . i think this is about it . <EOS> yeah i was working on some per personal preferences . <EOS> i first uh chose for the battery , 'cause yeah i'm traditional and that's the most obvious , easiest choice to go to . <EOS> but i really think that we should maybe uh think about the kinetic energy , <EOS> where you have to move the thing to be able to use it . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> no <EOS> i think that's alright . <EOS> okay so that would make our total of eleven point nine , <EOS> which is even less than twelve point five , which means we'd be making even more of a profit . <EOS> and if we sold a lot of squishy things . <EOS> boo yeah . <EOS>
no , <EOS> i think i think we're talking menu like contrast and tuning the v_c_r_ or something if i've understood you correctly , rather than menu as what's on . <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah , that that would be one of the features , yes . <EOS> okay . <EOS> 'cause that would be more specifically a digital box , <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS>
oh yeah . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm , <EOS> mm-hmm , <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> i really thi i i think maybe if we'd like all been working in the one room , <EOS> and they just said you know like every hour or something everybody make sure yo you know just have a have a short meeting and then just c <EOS> just to have like something written down , <EOS> just like you know a a milestone if you like um rather than having meetings , but <EOS>
i think that's what that is . <EOS> so these are just a few ideas . <EOS> again that's just quite boring shape , grey , <EOS> looks quite space-agey , but too many buttons , i think on that one . <EOS> yeah , looks like uh looks like something out of a jet . <EOS>
yeah , yeah <EOS> sponge , <EOS> yeah yeah <EOS> at least that's <EOS> yeah yeah <EOS> that <EOS> yeah yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> looking <EOS> yeah <EOS> fruit . these things can be easily incorporated . <EOS> we can have t colours or this shape <EOS> or at least <EOS> yeah .
yeah . <EOS> i mean , we gonna try to measure how good it is <EOS> instead of just talking about uh <EOS> we had three keys key points to uh for this remote control design , <EOS> and first one was uh <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> fancy look and feel . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> also . <EOS> yeah . exactly . exactly . <EOS> yeah that would be an option . <EOS> i don't know what you think . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i think the <EOS> i mean our aim is to make something different right ? <EOS> to make something new . <EOS> i would go for the double curved . <EOS> and i i'm i'm thinking uh you know uh a drawing palette , where you have the shape for your thumb . <EOS> so it kind of holds nicely , something like that . <EOS> well this is really your decision but <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> alright , um <EOS> also earlier we had something about losing it <EOS> and so now we're not addressing that at all , <EOS> so <EOS> we we <EOS> i think we can kind of say we addressed it with colour , <EOS> but <EOS>
oh . <EOS> um expensive , <EOS> no ? <EOS> yeah you think so ? <EOS> oh no it's it's much cheaper than the t_f_t_ , it's just a microphone and some some integrated circuits . <EOS> oh right , okay . <EOS> is it not the circuits that cost <EOS>
okay uh <EOS> agnes , you can help me for the slide when <EOS> okay . <EOS> yep . <EOS> sure . <EOS> okay , <EOS> welcome back . <EOS> i hope uh you have a fresh head and a fresh time . <EOS> how t now the meeting <EOS> actually we gathering here to discuss about the functional design meeting . <EOS> okay , <EOS> and uh we'll issue some information from uh all of you . <EOS> and it's in the , i think uh , in the sharing folder . <EOS> and uh i will invite uh the christine and the ed and uh agnes to discuss about on the various subjects . <EOS> so <EOS> can you go to the next slide ? <EOS> yeah uh <EOS> the agenda of the meeting is opening . <EOS> then uh i'm going to talk about uh the project management , <EOS> what i'm going to do , <EOS> and uh , of course , i'm doing the project management and secretary both , <EOS> okay , <EOS> to take the minutes of the meeting . <EOS> and there are three presentations . <EOS> one is uh new project requirements . <EOS> and the second one about uh decision on remote control functions . <EOS> and uh finally we are closing . <EOS> uh and the meeting time will be uh forty minutes , <EOS> so you have to be very quick . <EOS>
throwing and the kinetics . <EOS> oh . we better make we better make it like this . eventually . <EOS> it's shaking . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah true true . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah if you if you're going for the kinetics <EOS> yeah just light on top . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> for two seconds , then it brings you back one level or something . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> okay . well , <EOS> as long as we have that in mind as we're designing it still , <EOS> mm 'kay . <EOS> first we wanna know if it meets the fancy look and feel um objective . <EOS> so like <EOS> in my opinion the for now at least , the yellow one is probably somewhere in the middle <EOS> so i'm gonna say it's like a three . <EOS> that's just my opinion . <EOS>
i think i ha <EOS> yeah 'cause , yeah , <EOS> i just i don't see the cross-over between computers and television . <EOS> i mean i do see the cross-over in some sense , <EOS> but but but but with the the remote is is used for television , okay . <EOS> so so if we make the cross-over and we're gonna view television on computers then we're then we're losing the the necessity of the remote . s <EOS>
you <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> a kind of joystick . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> maybe we can have a wheel for incremental . <EOS> okay . <EOS> so have a wheel for incremental , have the digits uh on the lower side that can be closed <EOS> so as you say protected , <EOS>
and this is , this is with the curved that i mean . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> that's singly curved . <EOS> yeah . yeah ? <EOS> okay . <EOS> that should be nice . <EOS> well we could make a compromise between that . <EOS> but i don't know if it's worth the effort . <EOS>
we're , um , we're actually not having d_v_d_ , <EOS> that was one of th i i was <EOS> sorry , <EOS> i i meant to update you on that . um . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> alright . okay . <EOS> but the screen can come up on the telly , the she said . <EOS> that correct ? <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> um one thing uh , <EOS> we must first agree on uh what we're going to m going to make . <EOS> do we <EOS> are we going to use um it it for multiple systems ? <EOS> or uh <EOS> we should have some agreement on that before we <EOS>
yeah , see that would just irritate me . <EOS> oh dear . <EOS> oh , <EOS> then maybe voice <EOS> okay . <EOS> maybe voice activation won't be good . <EOS> so i think having a key-phrase is much better . <EOS> okay . <EOS> alright . but it's not gonna be voice activated in the fact that you would say , channel up , and it would work , <EOS> right ? <EOS> just a <EOS> okay , alright . <EOS>
oh that would be class . <EOS> oh yeah . there we go . <EOS> that would be great . <EOS> um <EOS> alright so based on this evaluation , do we average them out sorta thing ? <EOS> yes we do . <EOS> so i wh what was i gonna put for that ? <EOS> a two for fashion ? <EOS>
so . um <EOS> basically this is about a uh a new c remote control . um <EOS> we <EOS> when you design a new product you of uh you of course want it to be original . <EOS> be uh <EOS> we want to be distinguished , <EOS> mm ? <EOS> people uh want to uh when they look at the shelf want to think , well that's the product i i need . <EOS> so it needs to be trendy . <EOS> i mean trendy is what people want , <EOS> so then i w they will buy our product . <EOS> but then , uh , it also should work uh user friendly <EOS> and uh otherwise people uh uh well it will not be uh be rated very well in consumer uh articles and like that . <EOS>
right uh . <EOS> so um . <EOS> so where's the powerpoint presentation ? <EOS> sorry ? <EOS> microsoft powerpoint , right . <EOS> right , okay . so . <EOS> right . <EOS> okay , so we've got uh <EOS> so we've got new project requirements . <EOS> um . <EOS> so basically we've got three things , <EOS> and we've got forty minutes in which to uh for this meeting to uh to discuss the various options . <EOS> um . <EOS> three presentations . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> uh 'cause it's i think it's m much easier to use a plastic or a rubber rather than wood . <EOS> it will be much ch much expensive <EOS> th though it's the most natural thing , <EOS> but <EOS> i agree on that . yeah . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> or you have to put a language button in it , <EOS> but that will be a bit unnecessary i think . <EOS> it's better to put it on different markets with it all . <EOS> uh okay . <EOS> i will put the minutes in the project uh project document folder . <EOS> um what we're going to do for the next meeting is the industrial designer will do the components concept , <EOS> user interface designer the user interface concept , <EOS> and the trend-watching . <EOS> so <EOS> just keep in mind the things we've said about the target group , uh requirements , and the trends which are uh going on . <EOS> and uh specific instructions will be sent to you by uh the personal coach . <EOS>
i can go back . <EOS> yeah one question , <EOS> yeah ? <EOS> thank you . <EOS> i am . <EOS> i think we should aim at the young people . <EOS> but uh i think they are they are those uh who might be more interested in a in a new device . <EOS> in general the the early adopters of a new device are young people , <EOS> less than more than <EOS>
i mean if it's less than three uh then we can make it uh like a <EOS> two . <EOS> three buttons you mean ? <EOS> like three mental states , <EOS> yeah you know what i mean , <EOS> we can just make it uh <EOS> three option . <EOS>
yeah , you can . <EOS> right . <EOS> do all you all know my e-mail address ? <EOS> okay . <EOS> no i don't . i <EOS> i think he's participant one , <EOS> aren't you ? <EOS> well , in the project announcement , you've got the addresses , i think . <EOS> so project manager , it's participant one at a_m_i_ . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> um . <EOS> end of meeting . <EOS> you have to tell her , <EOS> she <EOS> so i think that's all for today . <EOS> okay we have to fill in all this stuff . <EOS> stuff stuff stuff . <EOS> m meeting adjourned . <EOS> meeting adjourned . <EOS>
uh if you <EOS> that's all right . <EOS> if you <EOS> do you want me to just cycle through it for you or ? <EOS> okay . <EOS> oh yeah , that'd be fine , that'd be great . <EOS> okay . <EOS> functional requirement by me ebenezer . <EOS>
that's true . <EOS> right . <EOS> i <EOS> when i'm when i'm pressing buttons on my ipod , that's how i do it , hold it and press the four . yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> so you hold it in one hand <EOS> and you press you press the buttons with your thumb <EOS> and <EOS>
whoohoo . margaritas for everyone . <EOS> good . <EOS> you too . <EOS> yay . <EOS> thanks to the project leader . <EOS> now we know w <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> mm . <EOS> so <EOS> is there any of these that you're looking at particularly <EOS> or is this just ideas ? <EOS> oh <EOS> you can actually , <EOS> for example , if you see , they are they are they are quite small over here , <EOS> and uh now you can , <EOS> for example , as i was if you make them big , it may change the look of the thing also to the people . <EOS> at the same time , it is m more uh like it would be more interesting for people who are having this r_s_i_ and all problem . <EOS> uh big keys may better for them actually and uh <EOS>
or not . <EOS> or not . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> just what i needed was something exciting . <EOS> remember , i'm an old man . <EOS> 'kay , ready to go ? <EOS> 'kay so we've got our conceptual design meeting . <EOS> hopefully we've all got exciting ideas now . <EOS> uh k exciting ideas . <EOS> 'kay so here's our agenda our agenda . um <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> so to keep it simple . <EOS> but i don't think that's really an issue any more <EOS> 'cause <EOS> well <EOS> might be . <EOS> if it's only for televi <EOS> yeah . <EOS> but i mean it , if it's only for t_v_ you're not gonna need a lot of buttons anyway . <EOS> you need a one to zero button , next channel , previous channel , <EOS>
well not yet other than uh doing research and taking remote controls and looking what other companies have to do uh , what they're building , their designs , their ideas , <EOS> uh also have to pinpoint which market we're gonna go into . <EOS> it should be a fairly large market because uh the number of people that uh the competition , <EOS> uh th i agree it has to be something it has to be something new , <EOS> it has to be something that that draws people saying eh , i like this . <EOS>
um <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> like a wheel on your mouse . <EOS> yeah , sort of like that . <EOS> you can even <EOS> sort of . <EOS> if we're coming from mice , we can even add a click function , <EOS> where you , in order to verify the information you just press it down . <EOS>
no it ca y a <EOS> the rubber which is good for health and which is quite disposable that we can take into co <EOS> yeah . <EOS> 'cause we it shouldn't be have any harm to the environment also , <EOS> because our company is very well for taking all these concerns into consideration , <EOS> so we don't want to have any harm to the society , <EOS> so <EOS>
yeah , but okay . <EOS> then do it correctly . stupid design . stupid . <EOS> and what else do we have ? <EOS> stupid , the l_c_d_ screen . 'kay wait , <EOS> i'm going to draw something <EOS> and you must y <EOS> what ? okay , i'm going to guess what you're drawing . <EOS>
okay i go , <EOS> but next time you'll do something i'm sure . <EOS> next time i concentrate . <EOS> i'm a bit short on cable . <EOS> okay . so what could i draw ? <EOS> maybe i can draw like a very simplified cow . <EOS> i don't know if it looks like a cow <EOS>
it's very <EOS> yeah , you missed the right side . <EOS> fuck . f <EOS> no , you're wrong , you're wrong <EOS> a little bit maybe , but <EOS> see where you're wrong now ? <EOS> the entrance . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> warning . finish meeting now . <EOS>
uh . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> because you have your previous channel button if you have incremental only it's not uh it isn't worth it because the previous channel is eith either minus one or plus one . <EOS> so i think we need also digits . <EOS> maybe we we can make very obvious the channel and volume button button and smaller button down there with the the digits . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> so <EOS> okay . <EOS> right okay , uh so i need to <EOS> right . so <EOS> i don't know how long we have left of our uh time . <EOS> but we have to make the decisions on uh the remote control functions <EOS>
yeah , without the energy , yeah . <EOS> yeah , that's that's possible . yeah . <EOS> you could <EOS> we could maybe do that instead . <EOS> so you don't ha you got like a rechargeable battery . <EOS> charging . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i dunno , <EOS> that might contribute to less people losing it too if it it stays in one place . <EOS>
i don't have a red colour . <EOS> usually orangutans have red hair <EOS> so this is a very important <EOS> but i don't have red pen , so <EOS> okay . <EOS> yes . <EOS> you want to draw something christine ? <EOS> okay <EOS> uh sorry . <EOS> you have to imagine a little bit um . <EOS>
oh right , about seventy , yeah seventy percent . <EOS> it's pretty good . <EOS> okay , good . <EOS> that was just a little formality for us to go through . <EOS> okay . <EOS> yep , oh <EOS> hundred pound pen . <EOS> sorry <EOS> alright . <EOS> no . <EOS>
okay it's fine . <EOS> okay . <EOS> um , i'm very impressed with your artistic skills , <EOS> mine's are dreadful . <EOS> oops this is now coming apart , <EOS> let me just put the top in . <EOS> uh uh <EOS> wo <EOS> i hope that clicks in , <EOS> i'll just i'll hold it on , okay . <EOS>
six point point <EOS> about six point five . <EOS> close enough . <EOS> six point something , yeah . <EOS> six point five , yeah . <EOS> okay , <EOS> that's pretty good , i think . <EOS> now wait until we get to finance and then we'll see if we can afford it . <EOS>
not as artistic as heather's drawing . <EOS> bit more cartoon style . <EOS> but i like cats because they're so independent , <EOS> and they always seem to be doing what they want to be doing . <EOS> um , but that doesn't mean they're completely not sociable , 'cause they enjoy interacting with humans as well , <EOS> and they seem to enjoy the good things like sunshine and , um , running around outside <EOS> as well as being inside , and enjoying their food , <EOS> and generally just , they just seemed so cool and they just know what they're doing . <EOS> uh i reckon they're sort of , they got it sorted . <EOS> they know what they want . <EOS> basically , that's why i like cats . <EOS>
you you need to be able to hold it so <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah okay that's true . layout . <EOS> that's for the <EOS> doesn't work too well . <EOS> it's uh it's bent . <EOS> i can't help it . <EOS> . <EOS> you broke it . <EOS>
so . <EOS> okay . <EOS> that's sixteen buttons , you reckon . <EOS> and then at the back ? <EOS> you've got brightness and contrast . <EOS> maybe if we're gonna run out of time , one of us should come up with a list of these and then get back at the next meeting just at the start and say what they're gonna be . <EOS>
so sh <EOS> should we decide in the next couple of minutes , and then <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i guess so . <EOS> so on the <EOS> so on front , <EOS> about the number . <EOS> numbers , <EOS> um the volume up and down . <EOS>
yeah <EOS> but i it's a detailed uh yeah yeah uh plastic versus uh wood , <EOS> and we need maybe to centre our description on uh the the really the what buttons what uh functionality we want to offer to the user , and maybe with uh graphs or i don't know uh <EOS> user interface designer you could maybe uh help us on that . <EOS>
that's the question . <EOS> let's fill i fill in the buttons later . <EOS> so this is gonna be from the <EOS> but we we <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i is it if if this is from the side <EOS> woah . steady . <EOS> because there the screen goes up like that right ? <EOS> so then it's like this , <EOS> or that's not convenient because then you have the screen like this and look like the <EOS> it's better to have it somewhat like this . <EOS> or does it flip all the way ? <EOS>
in general . <EOS> no , <EOS> but <EOS> curved ? <EOS> uh yeah . <EOS> i don't know if we should implement that , <EOS> because it says that teletext not really important , <EOS> but yeah , the shortcut , <EOS> and you can't go to sport . <EOS>
yes . <EOS> yeah , so you have the thumb kind of here . <EOS> so yeah , you need one one here and one on on the other side , so you got volume an and channel . <EOS> and , uh <EOS> and and you have two wheels . <EOS> okay right . <EOS> good . <EOS> so no l_c_d_ . <EOS>
oh , okay . <EOS> right . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> um . <EOS> maybe unless something comes up then we should i think <EOS> well you might get some research . <EOS> well shall we look into that and just get back together . <EOS> okay . <EOS> right so i'll do the minutes of uh this meeting . <EOS> and we'll meet back at i'm not sure . <EOS> um forty minutes , i believe is the time . <EOS>
yeah . right . <EOS> does it do anything ? <EOS> no . <EOS> maybe you have to just clap it down ? mm back up again . <EOS> no slide show . hmm . <EOS> it's off now . <EOS> it's off . <EOS> now you have to put it back o <EOS> oh yeah . <EOS> you'll be okay , i think . <EOS>
right <EOS> and they said they wanted voice recognition . <EOS> course , maybe they hadn't thought of this whole touch screen option , <EOS> but definitely we know the market is there for voice recognition <EOS> so to say we have the technology and we're not gonna use it even though we know it'll sell is a call i don't think i can give the highs ups . <EOS> like really i can't go in and say no we're gonna just ignore everything we know . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> the thing is that uh if we want to have as he says if we want to have uh a small number of buttons we need to have a kind of output that says currently what their actions are . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> then we can <EOS>
into electronic signal , which we pass to the infra-red l_e_d_ , which you aim at the television uh which and it receives that signal . you need a on-off switch <EOS> um i don't know how that got in there . <EOS> and uh we also need to um have the if we want a universal remote we need to have encryption codes for the different makes of t_v_s . <EOS> so we need to know all the different you know all the different signals <EOS> and so that'll require some memory as well . <EOS> um so here's just a basic layout of how how the remote would work . <EOS> you ha the v the power source is in the upper right-hand corner there , <EOS> and you can see that uh we have the user interface here which is connected to the chip which does all our signal processing , <EOS> and then passes that signal on to the infra-red l_e_d_ <EOS> and that signal is then emitted and received by the television at the photo-transistor . <EOS> so those are the basic components that need to go into this <EOS> and everything else is pretty much uh open to move around . <EOS>
no . <EOS> 'cause <EOS> 'kay . <EOS> and with uh the little screen in it , which explains the buttons . you could i think we n it would be a lot easier to <EOS> should <EOS> adapt it to different cultures . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> in different languages , you know . <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> i think perhaps that age group is significant as well because those are people who use the computer , <EOS> who are familiar with their with computers in in their everyday work . <EOS> i think people who are maybe about i wouldn't say thirty five , <EOS> but people who are about forty-ish and above now would not be so dependent and reliant on a computer or a mobile phone or something like that . <EOS> so these are people who are gadgety , right ? <EOS> people who are u growing up used to , you know in schools and in universities , <EOS> when you go on to their working lives , <EOS> people who would you know regular <EOS> yeah . yeah . mm . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> um well <EOS> play , pause . i dunno if that's usable <EOS> when <EOS> it's not , it's still not it's not anymore n uh <EOS> not anymore for t_v_ . <EOS> right , <EOS> on off . <EOS> i dunno , <EOS> miss did i miss any other buttons , basic buttons ? <EOS>
yeah , <EOS> but that's not possible . <EOS> mm-hmm , mm yeah . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> but you have uh uh an <EOS> yeah , <EOS> but you have an international market range , <EOS> so you have i think a big range of <EOS> add th that that's an opportunity . <EOS>
uh-huh , <EOS> fair enough yeah . <EOS> i'm not sure that i've got any favourite animal to be quite honest , <EOS> i think homo sapien <EOS> because of their their uh overall ability to uh uh <EOS> make mobile phones and t_v_ remotes <EOS> to make t_v_ remotes . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> i <EOS> yeah , so <EOS> in that respect <EOS> i think we'll go with that respect . <EOS> i think just maybe we need a different word other than fancy , <EOS> i'd say maybe aesthetic . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> well <EOS> we have got s trendy further down , <EOS> but <EOS>
um here we go . <EOS> conceptual user interface . <EOS> trying <EOS> we're gonna try to talk about , um what kind of uh how people are actually going to be using this ipod-ish remote control , based on fruit vegetable design . <EOS> and , um , basically , so , this is a touched ba a touch-based graphical interface system . <EOS> uh , so people are going to be looking at this little screen . <EOS> um , kind of <EOS> i mean i assume , are we still on the screen idea ? <EOS>
ah . <EOS> uh-huh . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> i hope you don't like snakes , <EOS> do you ? <EOS> i don't like snakes . <EOS> i come from australia <EOS> and we have nasty snakes . <EOS> that's where i'm from , australia . <EOS> i'm from melbourne <EOS> and i'm your project manager for today <EOS> and my role is basically to keep things going <EOS> and make sure that you all work together in a productive way , so that by the end of the day we come up with a great product . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> okay , <EOS> for the location . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> if if everybody in the house n to locate then we're to go for some speaker independent technology or something . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> okay . okay . <EOS> um yeah . <EOS> now let's talk about uh interface . <EOS>
about cost . <EOS> some information about that , <EOS> about um what people , <EOS> whether people would require um teletext in a remote teletext option in a remote control . <EOS> okay um . <EOS> so uh i take it your position arlo is that the bells and whistles we've gotta come up with the a gimmick but not too complicated a gimmick . <EOS> um so i mean a a the sort of inkling i'm getting from little bits of um web chatter that i'm getting sent is that they're quite interested in a t_f_t_ display , interactive display . <EOS> however that does sound a bit like the <EOS>
okay . <EOS> i think everyone's under three anyway . <EOS> mm . <EOS> so i think it's <EOS> yeah those are the only two points . <EOS> cool . <EOS> well <EOS> yeah the broccoli i guess wins . <EOS> yeah i'd agree with changing the shape . <EOS> um , i was just having fun making strawberries and stuff . <EOS>
yeah yeah . <EOS> uh-huh and also the switch . <EOS> okay . <EOS> mm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> and uh it's also cheaper to produce . <EOS> we can produce uh such remote control for about uh four dollars . <EOS> no four dollars , it's good . <EOS>
something with a grip . <EOS> mm . yeah . <EOS> yeah , with a grip . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> because even i suppose even with the ball <EOS> it still might be hard to <EOS> it still not the ho easiest thing to hold , yeah . <EOS> it's <EOS> it might not be the easiest to hold onto um . <EOS>
um something like that <EOS> um you got two groups there um <EOS> maybe it could fold up and you get a third group inside <EOS> or uh you have volume controls about there . <EOS> okay . <EOS> ooh that'd be good . <EOS> okay . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS>
green . <EOS> um um um , yes i see . <EOS> what does it taste like ? <EOS> and you put in the salad . <EOS> pep pepperoni . <EOS> um <EOS> ah yeah , <EOS> is it <EOS> what's it in french ? <EOS> poivron . <EOS> oui c'est ca <EOS>
and this is other one ? <EOS> that that you ca you can add up to the to your remote control <EOS> i i if you uh if you want to to have more more power on what you do , and uh which channel you want to choose and so on . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i never use it . <EOS> yeah but uh <EOS> i can't say i found everything particularly helpful . <EOS> like i <EOS> yeah . <EOS> it didn't really <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> my first bit of information was like this child's drawn picture of how a remote works . <EOS>
yeah <EOS> to flash up your <EOS> uh if you if you use the buttons , uh both of them works . <EOS> but one you can't see <EOS> and one indicates that you use a button . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> presu <EOS> yeah yeah yeah . <EOS> because uh when you button press a button and it doesn't work , it can <EOS> basically <EOS> if the battery is low , it won't work . <EOS> so you have to indicate that it's
mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> that's probably uh a population w quite a little bit of disposable income for use on technology anyway , <EOS> so that might be a fairly good target group for us . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> now , <EOS> those are <EOS> that's all specific for speech recognition . <EOS> are we gonna use that as one of our functions ? <EOS>
huh . <EOS> 'cause people regularly uh read from left top to right down , <EOS> so <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . well <EOS> this about it , i think . <EOS> okay . huh . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> and i just missed when i was typing the r_r_ stands for ? <EOS>
the question is also , i dunno , d do you really always want to open that thing when you have to use it ? <EOS> mm , that's true . <EOS> it's probably going to lie around opened all the time anyway , <EOS> so i don't know if a lid is a good idea . <EOS> from stabil stability point of view uh it certainly is , <EOS> but also you have to face it and take into account the more of these things break by accident , uh the more we sell . <EOS> so <EOS> it's <EOS> don't make it too stable uh . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> uh no . <EOS> because i'm only using three or four channels but <EOS> i usually just change channels . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> but they keep generally their t slash slash uh this thing and then the dash dash and then you can put yeah , you can only have one bit . <EOS>
so <EOS> and people can still decide to use the cheaper one <EOS> yeah . <EOS> instead of a <EOS> but for us it's <EOS> yeah <EOS> we have a constraint that we need to sell at twenty five euros . <EOS> mm , yeah , indeed . <EOS> th t t
yeah , it's natural <EOS> and i <EOS> yeah . <EOS> th the feeling is natural , <EOS> so maybe we can stay with wood . <EOS> and it can be correlated to energy , solar energy , so for the marketing aspect , <EOS> you know , <EOS> saying that it's ecol <EOS>
we are behind the scene and he is the front screen , so . <EOS> yep . <EOS> yeah , i'm the one who takes the heat . <EOS> if it's a flop , it's the marketer . <EOS> he's on the big screen . <EOS> exactly . <EOS> good luck , ed . <EOS> you look very relaxed , considering h you know , the uh the weight on your shoulders , yeah . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> which are kind of hidden away in some way <EOS> or well not hidden but they're uh they're not as prominent as the main features . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> um , yeah , hidden way . <EOS> and we also want it to be fashionable , <EOS> which i'm not sure if that's a function so much as a um yeah <EOS>
and we'll turn to the next presentation . <EOS> i think she said we don't need to screw it in , <EOS> just stick it in . <EOS> and then press , what ? <EOS> f f_n_ and f_ eight . <EOS> next to the control button on the bottom , <EOS> and then f_ eight at the top . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> then we we could use it . <EOS> okay maybe we can just uh listen to this presentation and then take decision later on according to those news . <EOS> okay . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah <EOS> but i think it's yeah <EOS> sorry , <EOS> i haven't written my personal references . <EOS> um <EOS> the i i just want to mention the the problem of the the r wheels sensor which is much more expensive than any push button , <EOS> and if we could reduce that . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah <EOS> we could make <EOS> orange or something . <EOS> or blue ? dark blue or <EOS> oh yeah yeah , dark blue <EOS> and then and then very bright , uh a yellow banana , an orange , uh a green apple , stuff like that , <EOS> with very uh bright tones i guess . <EOS> so you have something like <EOS>
yeah , <EOS> special . <EOS> and s i guess you have to mark special colour and special form as well , <EOS> don't you ? <EOS> 'cause it i it is very unconventional , <EOS> i like to think of it as unconventional . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> it's it's quite unique . <EOS> i like it , yeah <EOS> it's <EOS> so <EOS> it looks like <EOS>
so we have to give a <EOS> so we have give him give it a cute name . <EOS> cute na <EOS> yeah <EOS> th no , it's the it's the pineapple control remote control . <EOS> it's a pineapple now , it has changed . it's a pineapple . <EOS> pineapple . <EOS>
yeah . alright . <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> alright . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i think it's okay . <EOS> you get idea <EOS> right ? <EOS> okay um <EOS> we have a financial aspect to this project . <EOS> um we can sell them at twenty five euros . uh <EOS>
we have for the search function . <EOS> it's from rubber . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> the scroller a bit <EOS> i think it's it's a one yeah . <EOS> eno enough to i think . <EOS> it's a one i think . <EOS> true . <EOS> also huh uh-huh the buttons , are they easy to find ? <EOS> that was a big requirement of the old people . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> um , that's so this is <EOS> if you ask me personally , i would make uh flip-top with a trendy uh uh design <EOS> and s maybe we we should look at also like the buttons whe whether they are like soft or little hard <EOS> because they are times when the buttons tend to be a bit hard after uh continuous use usage and all that . <EOS> so in overall a simple and uh
like over here . r_r_ . <EOS> and j and the microphone , i mean it can be very small . <EOS> if you look at your mobile phones are some stripes , little little holes . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> maybe on the top or even on the side . <EOS>
f_ function . <EOS> function f_ eight yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> mm why's it in the right ? <EOS> no . <EOS> the plug hasn't come out at the bottom , has it ? no . <EOS> yeah , it's connecting . <EOS> no , no <EOS> yeah it's just . <EOS>
yep . yep . <EOS> oops . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> get up stand up . <EOS> just <EOS> 'kay . <EOS> well uh <EOS> we made a prototype . <EOS> we first start with the overall uh <EOS> this is about the total remote control . <EOS> we made it green . <EOS>
i dunno . <EOS> um . <EOS> think the the uh what would cost the less would be the basic battery , really . <EOS> and uh if we want something fancier , i think the kinetic provision of energy could be nice , <EOS> but i don't know if it's worth the cost . <EOS> so we've got to discuss that . <EOS>
welcome everyone . <EOS> um this is the kick-off meeting for the day . <EOS> um we're the new group uh to create a new remote control for real reaction . <EOS> as you can see our agenda is to open up the meeting , <EOS> um become acquainted with each other , <EOS> um have a little training on tools , <EOS> uh create a plan , <EOS> discuss things <EOS> and and we only have twenty minut twenty five minutes total . <EOS>
so <EOS> we actually worked well as a group . <EOS> i thought so . <EOS> right . <EOS> are the costs within the budget ? <EOS> yes . <EOS> is the project evaluated ? <EOS> yes . <EOS> oh yes . <EOS> yes . <EOS> yes . <EOS> yes . <EOS>
what user wants . <EOS> he wants a small remote control , <EOS> or ? <EOS> uh uh with big buttons . <EOS> it's difficult . <EOS> a sm <EOS> uh . <EOS> yeah , a small c control that they can hold in hand . <EOS> i thought that it it should fit in the hand or something . <EOS>
and maybe we have to add a tissue to remove the grease from all the fingers , huh . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah <EOS> you can do whatever uh any uh cloth . <EOS> yeah <EOS> but that that can be with plain soft tissue . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> you can buy those at <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> but it's quite possible <EOS> but maybe not in this project . <EOS> so we have i think we have s still we have couple of minutes . <EOS> mm-mm . <EOS> so any things to to discuss ? <EOS> i think as i discussed th that four points would be good for um marketing . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> okay , ten numbers <EOS> and then some kind of device to allow uh <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i'll put delay to allow um multiple numbers . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> or multiple digits . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> did we decide anything about um the other functions ? <EOS> as in setting the audio and tuning it and stuff like that ? <EOS> you had an had an idea about the menu ? <EOS>
there is one <EOS> yeah , <EOS> but we're we're aiming at a young public . <EOS> there's just one overall important aspect is that we must make it fancy and it looks original , <EOS> and i hope we can uh make it look not like the ipod itself . <EOS> it must have uh uh uh a very different <EOS>
that was quick . <EOS> i think that's the industrial design is the first one , <EOS> that's kate , for the working design . <EOS> and user , that's you s steph , for the technical functions design , <EOS> and for marketing the user requirements specification . <EOS> i think there's going to be a lot of <EOS> we have to help each other <EOS> and work through this as a group , <EOS> and i think we all , you know , we like our kitty-cat and our rat and our fish , <EOS> but i think we all have to like each other um to get this done . <EOS> uh as it says , we're gonna get individual instructions , <EOS> but uh i don't think they allowed a lot of extra time , <EOS> so i think a little bit of less of this and more at do will set us in good stead . <EOS> do you all agree ? <EOS>
th christine , yeah . <EOS> which is <EOS> yes . <EOS> yeah , so basically you need to interact with christine more , okay , for the user acceptability , okay , and the testing , okay , <EOS> then you will <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> which will also feed into the marketing , <EOS> because depending on what users want , depends on how you sell it , what tag lines you attach to it , how you try to make it more attractive to users . <EOS> so i think all three groups will need to interact quite a bit . <EOS>
this is what we'll do . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i found that we did we could have used another five or ten minutes sometimes in the meetings . <EOS> yeah , for some of the meetings , yeah . <EOS> especially last time , <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah <EOS> i think the last time we had a lot of information , but at the same time not quite enough , <EOS> you know what i mean , <EOS> like we we couldn't answer every single question . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> definitely . <EOS> so do you have any idea of how long it would take to have voice recognition now ? <EOS> ten years . <EOS> i would say . <EOS> i would say uh about eight months to have the first results . <EOS> okay so i it's a bit long yeah . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> s <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah records and stuff like that . <EOS> okay . <EOS> no . <EOS> you need additional <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> uh <EOS> yeah . <EOS> whatever , i'll just put my ideas in uh
yeah . mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> well <EOS> this is a requirement that we have to stick to i'm afraid , <EOS> this isn't one that i've just arbitrarily decided on . <EOS> so um <EOS> this is this is one of the solid ones that has to be obeyed , for now . <EOS> so <EOS> i can understand your point , <EOS> and i would agree with you , <EOS> but this is our design spec for now . <EOS> 'fraid to say . <EOS> um <EOS>
andre , just , yeah , just a a clarification question , <EOS> are they number of people per room indicated strict , or can we play around with ? <EOS> i mean if there are two people , is it really that you can't put three or uh two and a half or uh <EOS> how how was it calculated ? <EOS>
very new thing . <EOS> well <EOS> so <EOS> fancy the old people will . <EOS> i would make it a two or something . <EOS> a two ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> it's true , it's a one . very fancy . <EOS> huh ? <EOS> alright , it's a one . oh it's a one . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> so yeah , <EOS> i i agree with you . <EOS> okay , <EOS> uh next meeting will start in thirty minutes . <EOS> so uh <EOS> you uh will have uh individual actions <EOS> where i presume uh will be some feedback , uh via the m the mail . <EOS> um the the the industrial uh designer has to uh look at the working design . <EOS> uh the user interface designer has to look at the technical functions . <EOS> so <EOS> that's the thing we uh discussed . <EOS> yeah ? <EOS>
that was <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay , <EOS> so we we're looking at sliders for both a uh volume and channel change <EOS> um well <EOS> i was thinking kind of just for the volume , <EOS> but what what do you guys think ? <EOS> we could <EOS>
mm 'kay . <EOS> we just come to an agreement . <EOS> okay ? <EOS> so the first one uh , stylish look and feel . <EOS> okay . <EOS> i rate that pretty highly . <EOS> well yeah , <EOS> i mean compared to most remote controls you see that's pretty good . <EOS> i dunno like a six or something . <EOS> what does anybody else think ? <EOS>
okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> behind our product . <EOS> um and lastly the transmission interface is uh , just some engineering thing you don't have to worry about . <EOS> okay . <EOS> um so here's you know , a great schematic that my uh apprentice designer gave me . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> okay . <EOS> mm so <EOS> so , <EOS> i had some <EOS> so . <EOS> new information about the product requirements , <EOS> so you will have to take care of it of it in your thinking , in your designing of the remote control . <EOS> so <EOS> the first one is that um for the designing of the remote control we don't really want to use the teletext anymore , <EOS> as it's something that's <EOS>
yeah it's uh , yeah , that that'd be that's sort of comfortable to hold , easy to hold so you don't drop it . <EOS> it's not <EOS> yeah . <EOS> what about a banana ? <EOS> we could make novelty remote controls . <EOS> yeah ? <EOS> okay , like we could have a big banana shaped remote control , <EOS> 'cause it's yellow fruit , <EOS> right ? <EOS>
s okay so i'll show you the the two prototypes . <EOS> here we have the first one with the beautiful uh l_c_d_ um display . <EOS> you you can s here . <EOS> and you can uh just um browse into the the navigation menu by uh joystick joystick-like uh button . <EOS> you can uh choose the direction <EOS> and if you just push on it it's considered like a enter function . <EOS>
right . <EOS> well it lasts <EOS> it would last for several hours on its own power , <EOS> but when you're done with it you put it back in the cradle . <EOS> but it it takes away the ease of use of the remote to a certain extent . <EOS> you have to l sort of remember . <EOS> you have to d shift down the side of the couch to find it and put it back and <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> and we we have a circuit board uh in a remote controller . <EOS> can you go to the next slide , please . <EOS> and how it works , how the remote controller works . <EOS> when you press a button go away . <EOS> thank you . uh when you press a button , when you do that , you complete a specific connection <EOS> that means when you when you press a button there will be a s a small circuit underneath the button , and it will send some signals through the wires , <EOS> and then uh the chip will send start connection and knows that which button is pressed . <EOS> suppose you have pressed channel one button , number one you have pressed , then the uh chip will know that the number one button was pressed . <EOS> it pros produces a mors morse code line signal specific to that button . <EOS>
true . <EOS> true , yeah . <EOS> yeah . true . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> but that should also be with f should be also with l_c_d_ screen . <EOS> because then i think in chinese is different written , volume is different written than um swahili or something . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> yeah that's it for the working design , <EOS> uh i hope you get clearer view on uh what what a remote control is uh in terms of uh technical components <EOS> but maybe <EOS> yeah <EOS> yes . it it it's more clear now i think . <EOS> so <EOS>
yeah well i guess we really it we bounced off of each other , <EOS> which was cool . <EOS> like based on marketing stuff and then you'd say something about interface and <EOS> yeah , worked well . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
um as for , you know , the the case design uh maybe i'll come up with more concrete ideas . <EOS> right now it's just the idea of simplicity and slickness , cute and small um <EOS> right . i'm just thinking you know with all these universal remotes that are out there , how many people how many people actually use every feature <EOS> that ar <EOS> you know i like these trainable remotes and things like that , where , you know , it's just so confusing to do to use all these functions . <EOS> where i think the largest portion of the market is just gonna you know they lost their t_v_ remote , they need another one that'll work with their t_v_ . <EOS> they want something that looks nice , <EOS> that that that isn't gonna break when they drop it , <EOS> that you know that maybe it's it's ergonomic , it feels good in your hand , something like that . <EOS> i think that's gonna be where you're gonna find the biggest , you know , market share . <EOS>
for fashion , we go for fashion . <EOS> the fashion in electronics . <EOS> so we want to put the fashion electronics , we need to go fruit and vegetables . <EOS> and also go for a spongy feel , <EOS> so the the question of our technology whate is industrial designer . <EOS> as to the material should be limited to <EOS> i don't know how spongy it can be , <EOS> should discuss this together , <EOS> i don't know how spongy can be achieved but apparently that's the way to go . <EOS>
two and one . <EOS> sorry about that . <EOS> t two point two , which is one point five . <EOS> one . <EOS> uh three . <EOS> wait why did i put three ? <EOS> uh one . <EOS> i meant one on mine too . <EOS> okay . <EOS> three point one . <EOS> is that correct on my slide ? <EOS> yeah ? <EOS>
uh yeah <EOS> i just want to say it should be real smart . <EOS> maybe fingerprint recognition or <EOS> voice recognition is quite tough . <EOS> i say don't use it , and the control just looks . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> 'cause i ordered jus um <EOS> mm . <EOS>
s seven was th the maximum , yeah ? <EOS> i i go for seven . <EOS> so ? <EOS> i reckon it <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> seven , yeah , <EOS> it's terribly sexy . yeah . <EOS> oh we're all so proud of the . <EOS> okay , so that'll be a seven for a_ . <EOS> could <EOS> oh no , you can't whilst that's up there . <EOS> okay um uh what i've done on the next page is i've set it up so we just put the marks in . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> certainly , yeah . <EOS> so so tha <EOS> yeah , <EOS> we definitely need to operate within our constraints , <EOS> but um unfortunately i i do not have any data , <EOS> so uh i just identified the functional components for that . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> that's fine . <EOS> are there any more questions , <EOS> or shall we just skip straight to the next one <EOS> and then we can discuss all of them together at the end ? <EOS>
well , yeah , <EOS> i mean like <EOS> yeah , yeah . <EOS> mm and a lemon might be a little hard to grip . yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> but then how would you point it ? <EOS> ah <EOS> yeah . mm-hmm . <EOS> how would you point it ? <EOS> what <EOS>
okay . <EOS> so , um <EOS> maybe now we can talk about a user interface and uh about the technical function of this device . <EOS> so uh pet peter , can you talk say something about that ? <EOS> well , okay , yeah . <EOS> yeah , but the user user interface is responsible . <EOS>
here we go . <EOS> welcome everybody . <EOS> um , i'm abigail claflin . <EOS> you can call me abbie . <EOS> 's see . powerpoint , that's not it . <EOS> there we go . <EOS> so this is our kick off meeting . um <EOS> and i guess we should all get acquainted . <EOS> let's shall we all introduce ourselves ? <EOS>
yes , but it has your name on it . <EOS> well that doesn't bo bode well for it for it tats as well . <EOS> um so , <EOS> somehow that thing's too big , but um <EOS> okay um our uh manufacturing division wanted the speech recognition . <EOS> they say they could put it to work <EOS> but um we don't think so . <EOS>
yeah yeah yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> is that what makes them expensi <EOS> i think it's all of <EOS> they have so much memory though , <EOS> that's it's <EOS> i don't think so . <EOS> i don't think it's the wheel dealy . <EOS> i think it <EOS>
oh , something like that . <EOS> yes . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> that would b <EOS> okay , yeah . <EOS> well <EOS> b but make it a separate option in the menu , <EOS> so that it's it's dif dis displayed from uh displayed here , <EOS> so uh <EOS> parents uh <EOS>
yeah <EOS> . the following are a bunch of different uh interface uh concepts . <EOS> uh voice recognition , we we um actually have some new uh information from our research design team <EOS> but uh i'll get to that in a moment . <EOS> um , so <EOS> current voice recognition starts up to about eighty speech samples , <EOS> um and basically you record your own verbal labels <EOS> c and connect them to the remote control . <EOS> now <EOS> our design team , research team , has been able to uh set up a system <EOS> in which uh you can teach the remote control voice c recognition system to respond to um with standard responses . <EOS> like you could say good morning uh remote control <EOS> and it'll say in a sexy female voice , good morning joe . um . <EOS>
yeah , okay . <EOS> it's uh <EOS> so i just got a financial um <EOS> yes uh . <EOS> you s saved it or <EOS> yeah . i did save it . <EOS> no . <EOS> okay , let's have a look at this one here , the production cost of it . <EOS> if i forgot anything , just say it to me . <EOS> it just is a battery . <EOS> yeah , there are some that they didn't mention , because recharge is not on the list . <EOS> but okay . <EOS> so i think we are pretty much in the right direction , because it's twelve point three euros . <EOS>
easy to use , it's very relative <EOS> but three it's fine , i think , <EOS> it's reasonable three . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> do you agree ? <EOS> three ? <EOS> yeah , agree , agree . <EOS> so reasonably , is four , is one ? <EOS> three f three for me , it's o it's okay . <EOS> four or three . <EOS> maybe you can vote to see how many everybody gives <EOS> and no and just take the mean . <EOS>
yeah , that's the single curve indeed . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so <EOS> if you v flip it like this . <EOS> yep . <EOS> okay . <EOS> here's yeah . <EOS> that's not very i <EOS> it's also uh very handy if you make a side curve way to make the the remote control very thin at the bottom uh at a bottom at a bottom . <EOS> uh make it uh rather thick on the top , <EOS> because uh on the top it has uh the screen , <EOS> which takes uh in some uh space , <EOS> and the batteries can be located over there , <EOS> so uh <EOS>
okay . <EOS> we need to close the meeting . <EOS> um so <EOS> but just a small thing , <EOS> what kind of market we are targeting ? <EOS> is it that we are targeting the replacement remote market , or what ? <EOS> so the remote has gone bad and the person wants to buy a new remote or <EOS> because the cost of l_c_d_ thing could be as high as the t_v_ itself . <EOS> that is very important . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> mm mm mm . <EOS> mm w but then you have still have uh <EOS> when you don't use it you have such a a an extent of your remote control <EOS> which you don't use . <EOS> so maybe it's possible uh , i don't know whether you can can indicate this , that you can elsewhere open your remote control and on the inside are uh buttons you don't use that much . <EOS>
see you in thirty minutes . <EOS>
mm yeah <EOS> . i i th i think <EOS> mm-mm . yeah , <EOS> it's <EOS> um i mean i know that somei times my my wife goes out in the morning <EOS> and says oh i should have put the phone on to charge <EOS> and then then she's had those for so long that if she hasn't worked that out by now . um . <EOS>
you can pull it out first , maybe . <EOS> we've <EOS> well first first of all we made a an attractive base station uh with a banana leaf uh look and feel um and uh <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> bana sit <EOS> the banana sits in there k you know nicely weighted so that it's not gonna tip over <EOS> and um this is the remote itself , <EOS> it's kind of it's it's ergonomic , it fits in the hand uh rather well . <EOS> we've got the two uh uh scroll wheels here <EOS> which you know one on the the left for the uh volume and the one on the right for for the channel <EOS> and uh underneath we have the uh the turbo button <EOS> which is in like a nice uh trigger position for you know for pressing quite naturally . <EOS>
right . <EOS> you can you can just <EOS> acupressure , you could talk of acupressures . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> and finally the body should be retouchable , <EOS> may maybe ch you can change the body or the case casing the case outside , <EOS> it should be moulded it with the design in such a way you can change it every time . <EOS>
you can standardise those , <EOS> i mean . <EOS> oh , that's the other side . oh , okay . <EOS> oh , half a fruit . oh , okay , okay . <EOS> okay , okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah yeah . <EOS> i think tho i think if you're gonna have a facia then you'd want to have it so that it does go over the buttons , <EOS> 'cause when <EOS> if you think about it if they're wanting it , 'cause they want to look at it , if they're using it , and what they want to look at is facing away from them . it doesn't really <EOS>
yeah yeah , the previous button is . <EOS> mm <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> uh , okay . <EOS> history . <EOS> oh uh . <EOS> then you can watch what your ah you could also record your record your sequence of actions , <EOS> that becomes more complex , <EOS> but you could look at what uh the other people have used there or remote controls . <EOS> yeah <EOS> maybe it's a <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> if we can take it down to you know fifteen rather than twenty-five and make a low profit-margin on it , <EOS> but we're really doing that to sell the brand . <EOS> yep we have five minutes left . <EOS> uh rather th uh to to to sell for real reactions . <EOS> and i can communicate this to to the more senior uh mm people within the company here to to get a reaction . <EOS>
hmm . <EOS> 'kay . <EOS> uh let's see . uh yeah . so <EOS> a touchscreen . <EOS> uh and um th the buttons uh the real buttons uh we have to use um . <EOS> we better c um uh use uh quite uh large buttons uh <EOS> for <EOS> um yeah . <EOS> everybody uh have to use it so uh ol even even old people um young people . <EOS> so uh <EOS> we must keep uh buttons uh quite s uh simple and quite large . <EOS> so uh um <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah , so <EOS> y <EOS> yeah . maybe . <EOS> uh i think some time it's very uh convenient to use voice interface and gesture interface than use button . <EOS> for example , if you cannot find your uh controller , you can just uh just just uh speak something such as , yeah , one two . <EOS>
if you look on the desktop you'll find that there's a link to the project folder , or project documents . <EOS> if you save it in there we can open it up from here . <EOS> um , what i've done with it , <EOS> i'm sorry . <EOS> shit . <EOS> um <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> next . <EOS> let's talk about money . <EOS> just tr try to guess who is a user interface designer . <EOS> according to the drawings . <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah , well . <EOS> yeah , you're <EOS> not me . <EOS> so . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> gonna talk to you about the working design of the interiors basically <EOS> which is what dictates the design the both the interface basically and the outer appearance <EOS> because this is all the stuff that needs to go in there . <EOS> right . <EOS> so <EOS> unfortunately the people who were supposed to do this little presentation for me <EOS> obviously were too drunk to actually accomplish it , <EOS> so um <EOS> i'm going to do a lot of the stuff on the board . <EOS> um just <EOS>
hmm . <EOS> uh but i think we should be looking more along the lines of the one on the right , <EOS> which has it also has play , stop and pause and everything , <EOS> i don't think we need them at all . <EOS> i think we just need channel selection , volume up , volume down <EOS> and i think an an enter function where you can access it's not like teletext , but along the same lines , access things on the screen . uh <EOS> not related to the internet one that you mentioned , <EOS> because that'd be far outside our budget and what we want this to do . <EOS>
yeah . definitely . <EOS> um these kinda materials can be used . <EOS> but it doesn't really matter , <EOS> we just make it plastic . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , i think so too . <EOS> the scroll wheels , that's cool . <EOS> that's for the volume . <EOS>
it it only takes a l a little energy and it's not that much . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> if uh a mobile phone a phone can do it , it's <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> it's f <EOS> yeah . <EOS> maybe that's a good idea for old people as well . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> she would like uh this whole thing should be push buttons with a simple chip <EOS> uh scrolling method is more expensive and not that practical anymore . <EOS> should be battery operated and of course she would have the special cases . <EOS> the marketing expert uh who has to finally come up with to to to market this product has been watching the competition , has done some research on the internet and also has used h her personal observations to come up with the fact that such a remote sh should be small , easy to use and it should be eye catching . <EOS> from her point of view of course one of the most important facts is that we should get to market before our competition does . <EOS> to do that uh maybe one or two features should be developed on which we could dwell on or in other words on which our campaign could be built on . <EOS> too many new features or too many points would only confuse matter . <EOS> so we prefer to have one or two features that can be really uh driven home . <EOS> um it should have a fruit and vegetable design and should have a soft feel . <EOS> she feels that's really what people want today . <EOS> and the decision that we took last time was that uh the special feature we would like to see is a speech recogniser , <EOS> the energy should be battery uh should be on a chip , <EOS> should be trendy design , compact and strong , <EOS> and should have buttons . <EOS> and that concludes the presentation from the last minutes from the last meeting . <EOS>
left mouse button . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> okay . <EOS> 'kay . <EOS> that can come under arlo as well . <EOS> uh . <EOS> the basic that was the basic function to send messages to the television set . <EOS> that's what people want to do . <EOS> um , so they need to be included , um , <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> i'm thinking that's uh definitely a good idea <EOS> and i also think that we could probably come up with some sort of a cheaper uh means to to go about this kind of production , <EOS> my my team in the uh on the third floor suggested that uh <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> and <EOS> and the buttons , should they have colours ? <EOS> colours . yeah . <EOS> colours i think the main colour of the remote control is uh the colour of the l_c_d_ screen . <EOS> i because we don't want a lot a devi yeah a device self s g <EOS>
how do you spell your name ? <EOS> a_ l_ i_ m_ a_ . <EOS> thanks . <EOS> oh , <EOS> and i guess i'm the industrial designer on this project . <EOS> so <EOS> let's see if i can get <EOS> um here . <EOS> i will draw a little turtle for you all . <EOS> not necessarily 'cause it's my absolute favourite animal , <EOS> but just that i think they're drawable . <EOS>
sensing sensor machine that uh knows <EOS> it's a question to our technical design , our two engineers . <EOS> and another nice feature that i would like to implement is uh volume control . <EOS> suppose you set u you set up some volume <EOS> and then you move out or you move to the other corner of the room <EOS> and take your control with you . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> that's fashionable in itself to have interchangeable plates . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> it is . <EOS> i think <EOS> w yeah , <EOS> i think one . <EOS> well that was our brief and we followed the brief . <EOS> well we haven't got a big banana but <EOS>
okay . <EOS> a very warm welcome again to everyone . <EOS> um here we are already at our uh functional design meeting . <EOS> um and this is what we are going to do . <EOS> the opening , which we are doing now , um and the special note , <EOS> i'm project manager but on the meetings i'm also the secretary , <EOS> which means i will make uh minutes <EOS> as i did of the previous meeting . <EOS> and uh i also put these as fast as possible in the uh project folder , <EOS> so you can see them <EOS> and review what we have discussed . <EOS> um if i'm right , there are three presentations , <EOS> i guess each one of you has prepared one ? <EOS> good . <EOS> and um we will also take a look at new project requirements , um if you haven't heard about them yet . <EOS> and then of course we have to take a decision on the remote control functions <EOS> and we have some more time , forty minutes . <EOS> but i think we will need it . <EOS> um well i don't know who wants to go first with his presentation . <EOS>
what would you think yourself ? <EOS> i would say <EOS> i mean it's it's not at all , right ? in any way or shape or form . <EOS> we didn't m <EOS> well , <EOS> it's kind of curved <EOS> and we can make it yellow , <EOS> and that's pretty much banana like . <EOS>
yeah it would the d yeah the dynamo would take more space <EOS> 'cause you actually need a physical sort of handle to wind up . <EOS> i'm pretty sure that solar is from the sun . <EOS> yeah , okay . <EOS> mm . <EOS> uh , i don't think it counts electric lights <EOS> no , <EOS> but i mean not many you don't want to limit your market . <EOS> i mean people who live in basement flats there's not that many people , but there are people . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> is not a massive difference , you know . <EOS> no , do totally . <EOS> yeah , if we ta if we take fifteen to thirty five , <EOS> but that then does imply that we should try and incorporate voice recognition . <EOS> is that gonna have a an implication for the technical specs ? <EOS>
but , yeah , it can get lost . <EOS> the mobiles get lost all the time . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay , yeah , two is fine . <EOS> but then you ring 'em and you find them . so <EOS> mm . mm . <EOS> yeah , yeah . <EOS>
uh uh have we decided that we're gonna use this t_f_t_ screen ? <EOS> yeah but <EOS> no , i don't think it's seven by seven , <EOS> i think it's seven the diagonal is seven . <EOS> usually when they say seven inch i think it's the diagonal . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i dunno i dun i dun one each <EOS> . but , yeah , . <EOS>
no way . <EOS> no a_ . <EOS> . <EOS> so this doesn't go so fast this way . <EOS> and when i speak about method i speak about the marketing of the product huh . <EOS> and uh to me with this product we got uh we got basically three things to market . <EOS> we've got the features , <EOS> we have the uh characteristics , <EOS> and we have the <EOS> i i don't know what we would call the other part <EOS> what we call you know the the the corp corporate <EOS> help me . <EOS> the the corporation stands behind the product , okay . <EOS> so the features i think <EOS> we got the scroll , we've got the uh the locator , we've got the durability , we've got the dependability , <EOS> we've got you know the features that make this a unique product . um <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> so the grip is <EOS> no , that wouldn't work either um . <EOS> but if we're gonna make it flat on the bottom , then that eliminates our ball anyways . <EOS> so if it were flat on the bottom <EOS> and then had the sorta grips on the side here i guess , <EOS> um <EOS> and then flat uh <EOS> and then we have the problem with the hinge . <EOS> so if we're flat on the bottom , it's not gonna roll away , <EOS> it'll stay where we want . <EOS>
prove it <EOS> yeah , okay . <EOS> and that's the same for your when we do introductions i mean um and you talk about your background <EOS> you know <EOS> have fun , <EOS> you know <EOS> maybe you went to <EOS> um uh you know <EOS> maybe i you're like in maine you went to u_c_s_b_ <EOS> but you wanna say you went to harvard or something like that , <EOS> why not , <EOS> you know <EOS> you can this is <EOS> you know <EOS> i guess we can have a little bit of fun with it . <EOS> so are you guys okay with that <EOS> does that seem logical ? <EOS>
no we do , but it's not filled in . <EOS> it's number thirty . <EOS> oh , yeah , yeah , <EOS> you're right , sorry , yes . <EOS> it's not it doesn't say . <EOS> we don't have the price up there , <EOS> okay , so if we add approximately two to three euro per
no what i maybe think is um it seems the technology would be quite advanced for that <EOS> and they might end up costing more than our twelve fifty budget for yeah . yeah . <EOS> well that's right . <EOS> for the speech recognition . um . yeah . <EOS>
yes , great <EOS> i i'm surprised . <EOS> congratulations . <EOS> than thank you . <EOS> well we haven't come to mine yet , so <EOS> we're gonna have a bit of difference of opinion , yes . <EOS> oh , okay <EOS> . it's gonna cost a long way to c you know , cost a lot of money to market it , is it ? <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> so i the processing on on the remote controller <EOS> so it can u be used in any t_v_ , any conventional t_v_ sets ? <EOS> yeah , that's right . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> we . <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
um okay so , <EOS> do you think , since we this was a a sign criteria , do you think maybe we should put it somewhere in the middle then ? <EOS> does that sound good ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> what do you think ? <EOS> three ? four ? <EOS>
i think we should contact management . <EOS> during the kickoff meeting you say that we we shouldn't we shouldn't go up to twelve point five euro per unit <EOS> so how many units should we sell to have a <EOS> euros . <EOS> yeah , yeah . <EOS> well . uh <EOS>
the user interface design , they're kind of it looks they're the idea i've pushed forward so far is maybe more of a physical one there , <EOS> whereas possibly be more interested in maybe how the l_c_d_'s going to incorporate , do you think ? <EOS> or do you s perceive that most the design design decisions still need to be based on the physical layout ? <EOS>
then you hold it in your hand like this . <EOS> and maybe you bring the buttons nearer to the or the imp more important buttons nearer to the to the side . <EOS> right . mm . <EOS> yes <EOS> s to the thumb . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> to the thumb yeah . <EOS> maybe the buttons could like uh decrease in s <EOS> the bigger ones you know they could actually be bigger in size than the ones that are less important , the smaller here . <EOS>
that would be cool . <EOS> yeah . yeah . <EOS> i mean it just seems like <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so you could like um like if you have i dunno if you have satellite if you have a hundred channels , you can the way you do it on your radio is that you uh <EOS> what do you call it <EOS> s y yeah but you can programme , <EOS> so you can programme like your favourite channels , <EOS> so like if you had a s <EOS>
okay . <EOS> um what are we doing next ? uh um . <EOS> okay , uh we now need to discuss the project finance . <EOS> um so according to the brief um we're gonna be selling this remote control for twenty five euro , <EOS> um and we're aiming to make fifty million euro . <EOS> um so we're gonna be selling this on an international scale . <EOS> and uh we don't want it to cost any more than uh twelve fifty euros , so fifty percent of the selling price . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> to call . <EOS> um <EOS> oh yeah , that's still <EOS> call <EOS> yeah , but uh we have to make a speaker then too . if you want to make it beep . <EOS> yeah , maybe we have to skip that one . <EOS> okay . <EOS>
you have some in in australia , <EOS> right ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i dunno . <EOS> swordfish . <EOS> um , maybe . <EOS> i've never seen one , no . <EOS> oh well . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i hope it still works . <EOS> so <EOS> perfect . <EOS> so <EOS> i dunno if we need to spend time on that , actually <EOS> but uh <EOS>
yeah , that's me . <EOS> uh . it's uh <EOS> components design . <EOS> components design . <EOS> . <EOS> okay . <EOS> alright . <EOS> so uh . <EOS> the case uh le that's what i wrote first of all , could be plastic our plastic . <EOS> uh but later on we found out that um it can be rubber as well , or titanium or even wood . <EOS> so uh <EOS> we decide what it's gonna be . <EOS> probably plastic . uh <EOS> we need the infra-red transmitter . <EOS> get that off the shelf . <EOS> uh joystick we'll probably if we're gonna use it , um could be plastic w or rubber even as well . um <EOS> if you go on to the next slide . uh <EOS> if you go on to f uh findings , <EOS> it's like two or three slides down . <EOS> right . so , <EOS> this is what i found we can use . uh <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> um i'd say i'd give it uh a three , <EOS> i guess it depends on how tidy you are normally . <EOS> mm i'd give it a four . <EOS> um i'll give it a five <EOS> 'cause i it would be easy to lose something like that , yeah . <EOS>
no it really wouldn't be . <EOS> or like or like a light thing . <EOS> you know . i dunno <EOS> . yeah . <EOS> or make it mobile so it runs around and comes come find you yeah . <EOS> that would be really <EOS> i'm sure we could do that for twenty five euros a pop . <EOS> yeah . uh . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> football . <EOS> maybe what <EOS> so i think what we need to do is perhaps to synchronise the final the the launch of a user-tested device with some special event . <EOS> and and then um <EOS> so that gives us a little more time perhaps then we anticipated , <EOS> because i don't know when the world cup is , <EOS> but i'm sure there's gonna be one . <EOS>
i think we all have a presentation again , <EOS> so if we go through those and then um <EOS> right . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> three presentation , yeah . <EOS> so <EOS> yeah , fine . <EOS> . <EOS> shall i go first again ? <EOS> okay . <EOS>
yeah , <EOS> that's a cool idea . <EOS> um , that's about it , i think . yeah . <EOS> when you mentioned uh improving functions , what uh what do you mean by that <EOS> what what are you think about ? <EOS> uh not not the r not the functions , <EOS> but uh it came out that a lot of buttons weren't even used uh on a remote control . <EOS> so you can have a remote control full of buttons , a hundreds hundreds of buttons , <EOS> but if you don't use them , yeah it's <EOS>
oh , sorry . <EOS> we could . <EOS> aren't you ? <EOS> yes , you are . <EOS> and uh m did you do something with evaluation criteria ? <EOS> good . <EOS> and we have a correct agenda . <EOS> and uh then we have to look at something which is less nice , <EOS> the finance uh aspect , whether we can afford what we have designed , <EOS> and if we can we can uh commence the final part which is the production or project evaluation , <EOS> how did we work together <EOS> and what are the results , <EOS> and how happy are we with those . <EOS> okay , well <EOS> finance uh will be later . <EOS> now i'd like to give the word to you two . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay , so <EOS> good guys , <EOS> so see you for next uh successful project . <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> fruits . <EOS> mm 'kay . <EOS> mm . <EOS>
yeah , exactly , yeah . <EOS> well i'm glad you <EOS> that's actually very innovative idea . <EOS> okay , good . <EOS> sorr having a hard time keeping wi control over my face . <EOS> well , it's actually a very innovative n different idea that uh you know you can choose your colour of wood , your type of wood . <EOS>
o o or just two things which can be put on each other . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah exactly like nokia phones . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yes , exactly like it . <EOS> uh , so <EOS> yep . <EOS> maybe we can <EOS> but we have to decide it , <EOS> we can put the the the fancy f look of vegetables for instance , to to these covers <EOS> and s now try to invest in the in in the features . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> i guess . <EOS> 'kay . and you're gonna do some product evaluation . <EOS> okay , and right now , the i_d_ and u_i_d_ , you two are going to work together on a prototype using modelling clay . <EOS> great . play doh . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay , and you should all be getting an email pretty soon . <EOS> alright . <EOS> well , thank you for a very productive meeting . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> you <EOS> there it is . <EOS> ah-ha , <EOS> look at that , showing up already . <EOS> lovely . <EOS> so wait , <EOS> did it let you go on the internet <EOS> or was that just what it let you see ? <EOS> uh that was just on the d on the company web site , yeah . <EOS>
yeah , <EOS> my first question was does it have to be a a universal remote control ? <EOS> oh yeah , <EOS> that's a good question . <EOS> because we sell it uh uh uh lonely from the t and not with the television , we sell it uh apart . <EOS>
no signal ? <EOS> why ? <EOS> maybe again ? <EOS> yeah yeah , it says something now , <EOS> adjusting <EOS> oh . my my computer went blank now . <EOS> okay , adjusting . <EOS> adjusting . <EOS> but i don't see anything <EOS> i don't see anything on my computer now . <EOS> this is the problem , but <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah , me too . <EOS> uh one . <EOS> did you say one , rose ? <EOS> yes . <EOS> okay um , <EOS> also we talked earlier about r_s_i_ and wanting to prevent um any sort of like carpal tunnely kind of thing . <EOS> do we think that the latex sort of grip appropriately takes that into account ? <EOS> i think i'll give it a two , <EOS> 'cause i almost feel like no matter what you do , something is gonna happen . <EOS>
yeah <EOS> if we if we make a remote control just l with that idea in mind , we could make tons of money , i think . <EOS> we don't have to focus on on on the on the design then but on functionality . <EOS> we just <EOS> i haven't heard of it . <EOS>
it's not very promising but you know we're not young trendsetters . <EOS> no because there are more <EOS> yeah , we shouldn't sum like that . <EOS> well maybe we should we should uh have a look globally glob <EOS> because the the last two questions is much more important than the rest actually . <EOS> otherwise we wouldn't we will not sell . <EOS>
i would agree with you . <EOS> um i mean colour could be a sort of subsequent development <EOS> but uh you know cost a bit of extra money <EOS> f w w w w w <EOS> once everyone's got the first , you know , oh colour's out , we'll have to replace it <EOS> won't we . <EOS> it does nothing extra . <EOS>
nice . <EOS> yeah oh man . <EOS> but really uh i last lived in san francisco , <EOS> i haven't lived in cali <EOS> well <EOS> i haven't lived in southern california since i was eighteen . <EOS> going to s like north carol <EOS> i'm sorry you you just can't get a better burrito than what's available in the s in san diego . <EOS>
twenty five . <EOS> yeah , but how many units did we need to to sell ? <EOS> uh forty th four . <EOS> four millions ? <EOS> point point four million ? <EOS> four point four million . <EOS> point four million . <EOS> that's a lot of fruit . <EOS>
'kay . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah yeah yes . <EOS> if they want like uh so that we can <EOS> yeah . <EOS> kind of upgradable uh remote control . <EOS> wow , wow . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> just they'll get few more things and few more colours . <EOS>
yes . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yes . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> but obviously the board tends to disagree . <EOS> no <EOS> we we haven't voted yet , <EOS> so <EOS> uh i think teletext can be uh <EOS> um can be a function as well . but only if uh if it won't higher the the cost , <EOS> because i don't know if it will be a lot more money to implement teletext as well , <EOS> but i don't think it will be a problem . <EOS> or is teletext a <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> i think uh i in the beginning uh one thing was that was mentioned was that it should be mm trendy , user friendly and original <EOS> so um i think your point is relevant as far as the originality is concerned , <EOS> that we should provide some features that are quite unique to this . <EOS>
so , <EOS> basically we need <EOS> uh since we are focusing on our interface device remote control <EOS> we need few components , mainly the energy source like the battery <EOS> and then we have user interface like uh the keypad and you know buttons we want , <EOS> and then we have some chip , <EOS> it's mainly digital signal processing chip because <EOS> since we are i am one doing mostly digital uh devices <EOS> we ought to have some kind of processor <EOS> which take care of all these functions <EOS> and put it in some digital format . <EOS> and then we'll have the infrared l_e_d_ source <EOS> which sends the information to the main device . <EOS> then we'll have switch in our main uh um device to do particular operations , <EOS> and we ought to do different codes for different t_v_s , <EOS> so some t_v_s will have different encryption codes for doing s s uh channel changing and these things . <EOS>
do you think there's any way we could maybe remove the articulation ? <EOS> i can see why it looks appealing , <EOS> but it could be a weak point in um the structure , do you think ? <EOS> that would be a worry of mine . <EOS> so <EOS> mm . <EOS>
six , seven , eight , nine , ten . <EOS> so we're talking about ten centimetres . <EOS> that would be good . <EOS> so ten centimetres in height . <EOS> okay um . <EOS> that sounds good . yeah . <EOS> yep . <EOS> nine , ten . <EOS> yep . <EOS>
at four it's gonna be too heavy , <EOS> so that that's not our problem . <EOS> people can change it every month . <EOS> excellent . <EOS> they won't know until after they bought it . <EOS> this is consumerism . <EOS> alright so <EOS> for the electronics our choices are simpl simple chip-on-print , regular chip-on-print , advanced chip-on-print , sample sensor , sample speaker . <EOS>
which was one of the arguments to make it only for the t_v_ <EOS> because we didn't have the time to market a lot . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so <EOS> you suggest we could better um focus on for example the docking station . <EOS> uh uh like other functions . instead of f of less buttons . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> okay , um <EOS> looking at the interface concept , it's gonna be mostly examples of possibilities of where we can go with this . <EOS> uh if you wanna start the next slide . <EOS> sure . <EOS> um uh can't really see , but there's two possible ways , <EOS> on the r left , if you see on th on the sides of of the remote , you have the sort of scroll down , <EOS> so you have that option right there . <EOS> and then also there's the idea of the base . <EOS> that's sort of like an idea there . <EOS> and then on the right , we have what's really big trend right now , it's the ipod . <EOS> it's becoming really <EOS> and so you have this sort of very very simplistic menu section uh with the round buttons , <EOS> and it's sort of like you have the both kind of trendy and hip , but also very sleek and um and very simple , but technologically advanced . <EOS> so if you wanted to do that th if we could find a way of sort of like using that idea in a remote control <EOS> then sort of look into it , <EOS> but anyway , next . <EOS>
did i save this one ? <EOS> production costs . <EOS> i made your animal for you . <EOS> it was supposed to be pink . <EOS> but it was blue on the board . <EOS> yeah , that's the one <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> but yeah maybe <EOS> and what about if we design a remote control which can be configure as you want ? <EOS> you say that i want , i have six button <EOS> mh-hmm . a a lot of people are uh <EOS> if you have the l_c_d_ screen if you can do it completely the way you want because the buttons also look the way you want them <EOS> but it will be hard to configure <EOS> i mean imagine i uh <EOS> so it's really something for the expert user . <EOS> so <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> that might be good uh track to follow . <EOS> like as an optional thing . <EOS> optional or selled with it ? <EOS> and i i think we should have something , <EOS> most of the time i i lose my remote control . <EOS> we should have s uh special bu button on the t_v_ to make the remote control beeping . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> um right so <EOS> any comments ? thoughts <EOS> before we break into go into the next round of individual work on this . <EOS> since we're doing uh touch screen , do we wanna look into the possibility of people being able to input different types of skins for the you know the actual interface part of it and things like that ? <EOS> or is it just gonna be one touch screen for everybody . <EOS>
'kay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> 'kay . <EOS>
um minutes from the last meeting which were essentially that we uh had decided on roles for each of you , <EOS> however , um there are some changes that i've got from on high <EOS> that um <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> are a bit uh <EOS> well w what i didn't actually realise it was that the uh this is for a specific television . <EOS> so the all in one idea goes out the window . <EOS> and they require that the uh <EOS> actually i'll get to that at the end point number four , <EOS> um we'll get what you've got and then we can see what we can adapt from it . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> that that might be easier . <EOS> but at the other hand , uh a pen like that is easy to hold in your hand , <EOS> and <EOS> no . <EOS> i think it's easier to draw . <EOS> yeah . with a pen than with a mouse mouse . <EOS>
right . <EOS> handy . <EOS> yeah i like it , i like the idea , that's good . <EOS> um and we've sorted of discussed costs , <EOS> um . i guess we'll a that's gonna be uh a thing , if we run a bit over-budget , that might be okay , um . <EOS>
to talk to the to the t_v_ maybe . <EOS> yeah yeah <EOS> just you just put the controller here , <EOS> then you <EOS> i if you say one , he switch to channel , <EOS> yeah . <EOS> you use your command <EOS> and you do s your gesture . <EOS>
mm 'kay . <EOS> like um the ones the ones which i'm most fond of in terms of giving like a theme to it would be like um like lemon or something like that , <EOS> you know something which is , like you see a lot in in other areas . <EOS> like i see lots of websites and things that seem to associate with like lemon and lime and <EOS>
the uh the further work to be done is i the um the functional design , uh what it uh what it must actually do , <EOS> the uh conceptual design , uh how we actually present that to the consumer <EOS> and th the the detailed design i is uh how we get that into production . <EOS> uh now th the main design tool that we have available to us at the moment is is the white board <EOS> and uh uh let us very quickly do what i what it says in the in the in the prompt slide here , um <EOS> in fact i suggest to avoid everybody untangling themselves from the uh the the wires , that we don't do that , um <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> do <EOS> does every ones have the slide ? <EOS> three point one . <EOS> the <EOS> that was material . <EOS> slide show . <EOS> material technologically innovative , <EOS> okay . um , <EOS> do you want to change it ? <EOS> what are the suggestions ? <EOS> i don't know , <EOS> anyone ? <EOS>
cool . <EOS> fun . <EOS> i shoulda something like that . <EOS> if i kn see i i knew that . <EOS> i shoulda sort of engineered it so we k ended up making a diffi difficult shape . <EOS> just for cruelty . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> yeah . star fruit . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS>
it's still it's still plugged in on mine actually . <EOS> oh . <EOS> oh my , i'm sorry . <EOS> that's why i was looking over your shoulder <EOS> oh , okay . <EOS> sorry about that . <EOS> missed that one . <EOS> this ought to be fun trying to get this thing to work . <EOS> ah , ta-da . <EOS>
yeah . that's what i call painting . <EOS> so that's that's a dark blue basic colour i guess . <EOS> it's pretty nice . <EOS> mm . <EOS> y <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah <EOS> and then on top of that . <EOS> and then uh <EOS> oh <EOS> some yellow . <EOS>
lights . <EOS> 'kay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> um and then the other thing that we we're s we've committed ourselves to achieving is simplicity , <EOS> and so i'm thinking maybe should we try and think about having something like um some kind of an innovative concept about how the um the volume and the channels are controlled , <EOS> 'cause that's the main thing people will f wanna do . <EOS> could we use like a jog dial , like a nice just sort of round , somewhere on it where you just roll it ? <EOS> or <EOS>
think about it . <EOS> yeah , okay . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> it yes . <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> good <EOS> we're done ? <EOS> right , <EOS> thanks . <EOS> so , <EOS> yeah , <EOS> let's go to lunch . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> thank you , thank you very much . <EOS>
like you could if it was only this you know , if it was shaped like that , and it just had that . <EOS> but you see the problem is you have to attach that , and this has to be detachable . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> and what happen with uh radio waves when two neighbours have the same have our remote control , for example ? <EOS> and so do they have the same frequency , or ? <EOS> uh for this i'm not uh i i don't know the solution , <EOS> but one solution can be something like putting uh p password or something inside the wave , so the only your t_v_ can understand it <EOS> yeah , identification code inside the <EOS>
something like that . <EOS> with blue l_e_d_ inside ? <EOS> but that's not in the trend . . <EOS> the trend is spongy , and vegetable fruits . <EOS> you can make it um <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> it's not hard , the metal . <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> well <EOS> mm . <EOS> on the number of buttons , kind of functions and stuff . <EOS> i do however have this from over my head , that they don't want teletext on it . <EOS> mm-hmm , okay . <EOS> okay , cool . <EOS> uh maybe raj you could find out what people would think about that , <EOS> or maybe they'll send <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> it's gonna be twenty five euro remember , <EOS> so um it has to be avai marketable to um whomever it is . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> is it is it something that's gonna be sold separately from the television <EOS> or is it something that comes w with a television ? <EOS> 'cause that would affect the way that we market it . <EOS>
just sorta you you you know , your buttons . <EOS> thing is inside <EOS> i think , sometimes remotes have too many buttons , <EOS> so maybe as simple as possible , <EOS> um as few buttons inside as possible . <EOS> um , i dunno , what's the idea for . <EOS> just something maybe if you ha <EOS> if it had like if some kind of like light or something or lights around it . <EOS> it's looking a bit like something out of star wars at the moment though , to be fair . <EOS> but yeah . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> okay , right . <EOS> well , do you wanna maybe just , at this point decide on what we absolutely must have as a p as a function of this . <EOS> um , so so far , just to recap you've got volume and channel control and <EOS>
yep . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> um . <EOS> are they made out of any special material ? <EOS> no they're not . <EOS> they're not made out of wood or titanium or rubber or anything , they're just simple <EOS> rubber . <EOS> well they're rubber , aren't they ? <EOS>
if you like held it down , that would be on off . <EOS> yeah . on off , that's a possibility , yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> and then finally we have um the martian or the pear , either way . <EOS> um it's a bit different , just a little bit more of a creative feel . <EOS> uh you have the on off toggle stem on the top . <EOS> we have the five preset seeds . <EOS>
oh <EOS> you're fine . it's fine . <EOS> no , <EOS> it was up there , <EOS> but i couldn't see it down here . <EOS> mm . this time it should be both . <EOS> there we go . <EOS> how do you do that ? how do you make it do both ? <EOS> ah okay , <EOS> it toggles through , <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
well uh <EOS> yeah , but what what about case ? <EOS> uncurved , flat , single curved , double curved . <EOS> i think it's more like double curved . <EOS> that's gonna be double curved , yeah . <EOS> double curve , yeah , double curve . <EOS> one ? <EOS>
a little sticky pad to stick on top of your uh television . <EOS> and you just say something to into that <EOS> and it <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . finds your <EOS> k <EOS> or an isolated magnet or something like , <EOS> or you know something that wouldn't interfere <EOS> i don't know <EOS> that'd be the technical thing <EOS> but yeah i like that , i like that , the voice recognition for the paging system . <EOS>
i have an idea . <EOS> and it's kind of along the s lines of environmentally sensitive , <EOS> and it may even fit into ergonomics , <EOS> and even kind of address the issue of losing losing the remote , what we were saying it's a common issue . <EOS>
some but <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> i guess then it's <EOS> if we need to do triple a_ we can , but most people usually have double a_s around . <EOS> okay . yeah . <EOS> but that has to do with the size of it too . <EOS> well , w as long as we know that issue is <EOS>
the last point is quite an interesting <EOS> yes , <EOS> fifty percent of users say they only use ten percent of the buttons . <EOS> um martijn alr already said it . <EOS> and uh maybe our uh fold open system is is a good one , <EOS> but <EOS>
oh right . <EOS> mm s . <EOS> okay , cool . <EOS> it's not coming . <EOS> function f_ eight , okay . <EOS> oh . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . no signal . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> computer . <EOS> there you go . <EOS> computer adjusting , yeah . <EOS>
the next ? <EOS> yes . <EOS> okay . <EOS> then uh . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> thanks . <EOS> here you go . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> is this part of our a acquai or introduction to each other ? <EOS> yeah <EOS> sorry , <EOS> introduction and get acquainted <EOS> and <EOS>
in my next life . <EOS> yeah , yeah , if you're around them for a long period of time <EOS> i still can't sleep with them in my room . <EOS> okay . <EOS> oh , yeah , <EOS> this summer i , oh i had to live with cats . <EOS> it was crazy . <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> i don i i d <EOS> i have to disagree though . <EOS> i think our market niche is basically people who need who have lost their remote <EOS> or uh who've broken their remote and don't wanna send back to the manufacturer , <EOS> they just wanna run out to the store and get a remote , <EOS> and then they're gonna look on the shelf and they're gonna see ours is the nicest looking remote . <EOS> it does what they need . <EOS> these aren't <EOS> i i think that it <EOS>
cost of living is low . <EOS> so <EOS> good , <EOS> well th that'd be something that manufacturing would have to um explore more <EOS> and to where <EOS> yeah , yeah , so <EOS> mm yeah . <EOS> where w where it would be manufactured is is another step . <EOS>
well <EOS> it's interesting that they <EOS> mm-hmm , yeah . <EOS> it was interesting though that they put that fifty percent of people say they have frustration with losing their remote <EOS> and yet they didn't provide us with information to um we weren't provided with information to discuss that . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> you can cut the t_f_t_ screen . <EOS> let's go . <EOS> yeah , no no problem , <EOS> because because because then the size of the graphic card will be one fourth . <EOS> so <EOS> so let's cut the t_f_t_ . <EOS> yeah , but no problem to to me to cut the screen . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> ye <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i mean , that's okay . so let's go to the industrial designer . <EOS> maybe we'll be able to take a decision after that , <EOS> so . <EOS> the point . okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS>
so it's something like a microsoft product update . <EOS> updates and we sell it . <EOS> we make updates and sell it . <EOS> and and we we we we we we don't want that . <EOS> yeah well if the buyers can be up the th would be can be upgraded , it would be a good thing right ? <EOS> yeah , it depends on the v production . <EOS>
prototype , yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay . okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> thanks . <EOS> s so who is going to take the remote control ? <EOS>
i don't know if it works but it should be saved . <EOS> aye <EOS> y you saved it ? <EOS> does it save automatically in the project folder ? or <EOS> yeah . <EOS> it's uh <EOS> okay . we'll see . <EOS> just put back my laptop . <EOS>
so it's pretty big . <EOS> well , <EOS> spread it by a big market . <EOS> but then i i i <EOS> even bigger than for l_c_d_ . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> w <EOS> i know let's do a speech . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> well let's leave out all the remote controls <EOS> and just put a microphone on top of the television to <EOS>
yeah , <EOS> but y you could you could make 'em uh uh like blue and transparent . <EOS> so you can still th look through it . <EOS> yeah . cool . <EOS> yeah . yeah . <EOS> um the buttons . normal rubber i think . like normal ordinary buttons . soft . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm . <EOS> oh n yeah , yeah <EOS> tha that's why we have to do language adaptation . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> but for each country you have to do one , <EOS> because uh the for example for se <EOS> yeah . <EOS> even for each f for even for different family we have to do d yeah we would we have to do adaptation to <EOS>
okay . <EOS> can we think about that ? <EOS> 'cause if we're doing the kinetic thing <EOS> and it's <EOS> yeah . <EOS> shouldn't we do some market research on that first before we add it in <EOS> because i i personally <EOS> right , okay . <EOS> well add it in to think about um <EOS> because , <EOS> where am i ? <EOS> if it is the kinetic thing <EOS> and it is small and it is portable and it is a different shape <EOS> and the kinetic is something people don't do kind of <EOS> we're doing something original and different <EOS> um but if you wore it if it's something you could just clip on your pocket then you would have that less , you you wouldn't lose it so much . <EOS>
yeah , that's right . <EOS> yeah , okay . <EOS> no . <EOS> yeah that's uh . <EOS> i think n m n most televisions nowadays do this . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> but uh they don't use the same signal , uh on remote control . <EOS> because you can't use a panasonic uh remote control on a on a philips television . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> oh . <EOS> wow . <EOS> 'cause you've had like the most typing and organising to do . <EOS> but i didn't have like information to sloth through either , so <EOS> yeah , i guess <EOS> how much of your powerpoint was already done for you , <EOS> every meeting . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . that's good point . <EOS> what's what cou what could be the cost of uh <EOS> well , could we fit the the targets uh in terms of cost uh if we go s to l_c_d_ on the remote control ? <EOS> for twenty five euro ? i think it's impossible . <EOS> but but i dunno , <EOS> i think um it would be good to know if there is any leverage in that any leeway in that um that twenty five euro <EOS> because for twenty five euro i think all we can really do is provide a very basic remote control , <EOS> and that seems to be kind of against the philosophy of our company which is you know putting the fashion into electronics . <EOS> so i would i would like to know if there's any chance of of increasing the uh <EOS>
mm . <EOS> 'cause it's kind of moulded to your hand anyway . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> the way you h hold of it's kind of semi-circular in the bottom , something like that . <EOS> okay . <EOS> i wouldn't say exactly semi-circular but yeah smooth . <EOS>
okay , let's talk about uh maybe first uh for the prototype . <EOS> mm , okay . <EOS> so i handle to <EOS> i've done a presentation , <EOS> but it pretty much covers work that we've both done , <EOS> so if i'm missing anything , christine can just correct me . <EOS>
the last one is the most important one , is it ? <EOS> oh , sorry . <EOS> no the first one is the <EOS> uh the outlook of the mobile , the it should have a fancy outlook , <EOS> the fancy design <EOS> uh rather than just having a functional look and feel good , it should have a fancy look and foo feel good . <EOS> the second most important aspect is that remote control should be a technologically uh innovative . <EOS> we must have some technological advancement in the remote control tha rather than just putting it as it is as the other remo uh remote controls are . <EOS> so it uh should be technologically innovative like glow-in-the-dark or speech recognition , something like that . <EOS> so that indicates our technological advancement . <EOS>
trend watching has a later date there . <EOS> forty six nineteen fifty seven . yep . <EOS> see what it looks like . <EOS> it's been so long . <EOS> . <EOS> well i don't know what to say . <EOS> when i s when i see the when i see the product i i i i don't wanna buy it . <EOS> i see so many of 'em out there . <EOS> there's nothing about that product that makes me wanna choose that product over other products that are out there . <EOS> yeah yeah . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> ma maybe maybe you can draw it on the on the board uh <EOS> mm . but i think taking the idea of getting inspiration from mobile phones is interesting , especially if we're going after a younger market , <EOS> that's the the the mm the new and the funky things , <EOS> that's , <EOS> yeah , <EOS> there's lot there's lots of pretty mobile phones , <EOS> not too many pretty remote controls . <EOS> that's <EOS>
yeah <EOS> so it should fit right in into your hand . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> l left top or right uh top ? <EOS> right . right . <EOS> i most people are right-handed so <EOS> maybe left-handed special addition , but okay . <EOS> if you put it like like here . or something . <EOS> i dunno . <EOS>
yeah but <EOS> okay . <EOS> sa let's say that th o <EOS> it has to be <EOS> basically you can only take two sides , <EOS> one on ths this side where is the thumb and the other side where there is uh yeah also the thumb . <EOS> basically . <EOS> or you could use use this one , <EOS> but i don't know if it's very comfortable , to use this one for the wheel . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> and it's spongy as well . <EOS> so so uh the user interface as as we discussed last time uh mm on on the on the cover we just have the very basic things . <EOS> so we have that n uh channels here starting from um uh one two three <EOS> there would be numbers in in the on the actual one . <EOS> so it's four , up to four , up to seven , up to nine and zero , z zero here . <EOS>
so before uh finishing we can uh define uh what would be the characteristic of the o th of the control of the remote control <EOS> and which button do we need which function do we want etcetera . <EOS> capital . <EOS> mm . <EOS> so <EOS> do you um so <EOS> so from from the the marketing expert i think a key aspect is the easy to use aspect , <EOS> it should be very simple and most button are never used <EOS> only ten per cent of the button are are used often <EOS> so i think we have to do something very simple <EOS> and i think we all agree on that point , <EOS> no ? <EOS>
uh-huh . <EOS> well d do you feel though that that you were able to have quite a lot of creative input into the thing ? <EOS> d debating <EOS> yeah , yeah <EOS> but that's just <EOS> the thing is the quest in terms of the the first point there , the room , <EOS> it feels as though the creativity goes on when we leave , and then we come here and then we kind of put out our ideas and then , you know . <EOS>
internet . <EOS> i'm gonna get kicked if i don't do it so <EOS> alright . <EOS> okay . <EOS> alright . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> make me proud . <EOS> i'll try to . <EOS> so first we have a lunchbreak now ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> alright . <EOS>
yeah yeah . <EOS> here ? sure . <EOS> and where is it sorry ? <EOS> uh pro uh project documents . <EOS> on <EOS> so it should be when you save <EOS> a_m_i_ scenario controller . <EOS> on your desktop , so it goes save as , or <EOS> oh . <EOS>
well . <EOS> okay . <EOS> i felt very creative . <EOS> i enjoyed making the prototypes . <EOS> i think we've been successful <EOS> in that we've achieved almost all of the design goals that we've set <EOS> and we've come up with a finished project <EOS> and we just about got cost . <EOS>
yeah , digital pens . <EOS> they were fine . <EOS> i really appreciated those , yeah . <EOS> the use of the laptops for receiving everything . <EOS> it was wireless too , so . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> right , laptops are extremely handy , <EOS> wireless . <EOS> and that we have a shared network where we can put all of the <EOS>
uh yeah . <EOS> 'cause we've we've brought it down to basically four controls most common , which are channel and volume . <EOS> and then the other ones are just a matter of just going , just scrolling further . <EOS> yeah . i'd say that <EOS> right . <EOS>
ah <EOS> it's a baby shark , it looks to me , <EOS> you know it's going to eat the cat rather than the cat eating the fish , no ? <EOS> mm . <EOS> oh . <EOS> now it's a swordfish . <EOS> why not . a swordfish . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> well it works pretty well . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> and then time was up . <EOS> uh not yet . <EOS> uh <EOS> . <EOS> do you get a pop-up if we <EOS> yeah within five minutes yeah . <EOS> that you have five minutes left or <EOS>
okay , so , any questions ? <EOS> no . <EOS> so , by next meeting , so , please come up with the the prototype , okay , <EOS> then uh , then we can proceed from there . <EOS> okay . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> it's okay ? <EOS> so thanks for all your uh efforts and coming for the meeting again , and see you soon then . <EOS> okay ? <EOS> thank you . <EOS>
oh . <EOS> yeah , they could be plastic . <EOS> okay . um <EOS> let's put that rubber in then , of the case material supplement . <EOS> it's just one , <EOS> isn't it ? <EOS> uh we only need one of them . <EOS> okay , <EOS> i'm going to save this into our desktop , project documents . okay . as our project document bit . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> i mean we've done some research um about sort of you know what the cutting edge sort of hand held devices are , <EOS> and a lot of them sort of use you know they're like they're like mini laptops . <EOS> so it's possible that we could devise a system where where you're you're basically sort of holding a a miniature computer which is controlling all your your sort of your television , your stereo , <EOS> and where you know if you buy a new thing then it sort of you can link it to that as well , maybe . <EOS>
yeah <EOS> but first maybe what is what are the usual function of a standard remote control ? <EOS> i mean <EOS> okay . <EOS> what do <EOS> okay , well , i mean the obvious one is changing channels . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
yes . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> but the second parts , uh like speech , etcetera , that will be harder to learn . <EOS> so it is learnable um f i i in the first place it's very easy to use . <EOS> and i think its scrollwheel is u easy to use as well , if you have ever used uh a different kind of uh of uh device . <EOS>
so basically , <EOS> that's what we don't want . <EOS> m we don't want lots of buttons , uh complicated features . <EOS> we want something that looks nice and simple . <EOS> here's a a fairly simple device . <EOS> this is an an ipod from apple . <EOS> um i think the main thing to notice about it is it just has four buttons . <EOS> it's very minimalistic in its design . <EOS> uh you use these four buttons to m to move around a range of settings on the small l_c_d_ screen . <EOS> um the thing i like about this is that <EOS>
hmm hmm hmm . <EOS> are we <EOS> we're not allowed to dim the lights so people can see that a bit better ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay , that's fine . <EOS> am i supposed to be standing up there ? <EOS> so we've got both of these clipped on ? <EOS>
um well i think the advanced ones the the ones you don't usually use could be hid inside . <EOS> b um i think the we had were fairly basic ones , <EOS> they'd have to go on the the front somewhere . <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay <EOS> right um <EOS> what else do you need to talk about ? <EOS>
i gave it a four , yeah , i feel it's just average . <EOS> um , i dunno . <EOS> i think i would give it at least a two . <EOS> okay . <EOS> one . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah , even i think it is one . <EOS> it's quite small . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm , 'kay . <EOS> mm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah , sure . <EOS> if there is a clock then there can be a alarm clock . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> and an alarm clock , yeah that should that should be okay . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so , from the bottom or whatever is there , uh the uh the numbers and then the top , uh until the ten also , this middle part , <EOS> and on the left one is exactly the same . <EOS> so it's basically more or less how we would like it , with a big volume control , big channel control , and mute and power , <EOS> yeah ? <EOS> these are the basic thing . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> no problem . <EOS> don't feel pressurised into using this thing . <EOS> 'cause i don't . <EOS> uh okay . so um . <EOS> you okay over there ? reissa , <EOS> are you uh b are you joining in with this meeting here <EOS> or are y or are y or are you are you just are you just uh doing some internet shopping there ? <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> mm . <EOS> uh . <EOS> but maybe just a little led , <EOS> i don't know . <EOS> that's an idea as well . <EOS> okay , <EOS> then i'll put the minutes from this meeting in the project folder , <EOS> and then we can all work . <EOS> finish meeting now . <EOS> okay . <EOS> and we can all work uh on our own projects . <EOS>
i'd say w yeah one . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> ooh . mm . <EOS> question number nine . <EOS> uh , will it minimise the effects of r_s_i_ , <EOS> which was repeated strain injury ? <EOS> um , which affected over a quarter of users . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> so we just have it like add a menu button then for the various things needed , <EOS> including v voice recognition if we have any like settings for voice recognition now <EOS> right . <EOS> in the middle perhaps . <EOS> included in the menu . <EOS>
fruit . <EOS> even shape ? <EOS> more <EOS> yeah . <EOS> more uh uh look natural somehow . i mean mm-mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> and not those futuristic uh remote control with angles and uh and titanium like . mm-hmm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> so that's what people seem to <EOS> yeah i i know it's quite far from what you thought <EOS> but that's that's fashion <EOS> and <EOS>
all set ? <EOS> okay . cool . <EOS> right . so um basically <EOS> i'm just gonna go over real quickly um some news i've just got from the board on how we're supposed to do with this um remote control . <EOS> and then i'm gonna turn over to you guys to make brief presentations um on what you've found <EOS> and then we'll have a bit of discussion . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> i can't remember what it's called , the little code at the end of programme details , yes . <EOS> video plus . <EOS> we could use that as an alternative to programming in times , things like that , <EOS> is that <EOS> i always found that really easy when i discovered it , um <EOS>
mush mushroom controller . <EOS> you cannot say mushroom because it's not the trend . <EOS> it's not the trend . <EOS> it's not a mushroom . <EOS> it's a pineapple remote controls . <EOS> pa <EOS> pine apple . <EOS> yeah , pineapple remote remote control . <EOS> yeah , but just flying saucer , or <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> the remote control . <EOS> mm . <EOS> right . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yes . okay , cool . right , um <EOS> sorry <EOS> this is pink because i was copying and pasting the table , <EOS> and i didn't have time to white it out again . <EOS> um okay , <EOS> but that shows how people whether they would pay more for voice recognition software . <EOS> so you can see from that that , you know , younger people to the age of thirty five are quite likely to pay quite a lot more f well quite are quite likely to pay more for voice recognition software , <EOS> whereas as people get older , they're a bit more sceptical about it <EOS> and they're less willing to to try it . <EOS> um so clearly voice recognition is something to think about , <EOS> but um you know i d i do wonder how well that would work given that a t_v_ , you know , tends to be people talking <EOS> and um , you know , how are you going to stop it from just flipping channels whilst watching t_v_ . <EOS> um okay ? <EOS>
okay . <EOS> r is it is it is it s <EOS> is it not an option still that we include some things just as a sort of under like sort of under a door or some <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay , i think <EOS> yeah , it's as optional functions . <EOS>
more or less . <EOS> um i started filling it in , <EOS> but of course these are provisional , so we have to go down . <EOS> no hand dynamo , right ? <EOS> one simple battery . <EOS> no kinetic energy , <EOS> no solar . <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
yeah if you're just sitting there going <EOS> yeah . <EOS> that's kinda cool actually . <EOS> i like that . <EOS> now just just so you know though uh you did bring up a point which is very valid , is a lot of t_v_s won't re the t_v_s won't respond exactly the same . <EOS> some of them are gonna be kinda slow switching , <EOS> so you may like queue up like fifteen channel changes , and it'll be like flip , flip , flip . <EOS>
i've been looking at the the basics of how these devices actually have to work in order to operate , <EOS> and i've had some discussions with the ma manufacturing division , <EOS> who have told me what's actually available , you know , what the current state of the art in components is , and some of the exciting new things they've got , <EOS> but i'm not sure that it's quite what you want <EOS> um . now <EOS> this isn't a very good overhead , <EOS> but this is just to show you , <EOS> this is the innards of a remote control um . <EOS>
which if it works perfectly well i see no point in improving on if it works , <EOS> so . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah , yeah . <EOS> absolutely , <EOS> and it's kept us within budget . <EOS> yes . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so we do count as i think excellent or one . <EOS>
be interesting . <EOS> mm . <EOS> what what would be on that touch screen ? <EOS> 'cause you said earlier that we have to think about company colours and um <EOS> and oh . <EOS> yeah <EOS> the the fashion <EOS> do . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> logo or something or motto , <EOS> i can't remember exactly what you said . <EOS>
each . <EOS> per unit , yeah . <EOS> cost . <EOS> so do we have to be realistic within the budget or <EOS> close pr i don't know how much it would cost . yeah . <EOS> couldn't we have like one that comes out ? <EOS> like so you have one in like mm <EOS> it doesn't have to be really thick . <EOS> i mean remote controls can be thin bits . <EOS> and then you have one for your d_v_d_ and you sort of slide it out , <EOS> and then you have another one , you slide it out . <EOS> have slides . <EOS> and then it all comes compact <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> intuitive . <EOS> yeah , and i mean d <EOS> so <EOS> and uh even the scroll , it's a it's a new technology <EOS> so m m might be a little more difficult for people to get used to in the beginni <EOS> so it is kind of not very intuitive <EOS> but uh it's a good technology , i mean once they get used to it . <EOS>
who's got an ipod then ? <EOS> mm . okay . <EOS> people have made , what's most important . it's definitely channel , volume , power . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> things like screen settings and audio settings , i would generally do them on the actual television itself , <EOS> like here you have a
and we are to take a decision on the remote control concept and uh the functional design <EOS> so we have forty minutes , <EOS> i think it's uh little bit uh low , <EOS> but i i hope we can finish it up <EOS> so i'll handle to the the functional team , <EOS> to the christine , okay , <EOS> to discuss about uh the components concept . <EOS>
ma maybe a home station . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm yeah . <EOS> maybe that's a good idea , <EOS> but yeah , we have to look at the price now i think . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> how m how mu how how expensive uh is a normal recharger ? <EOS>
we only have very sparse <EOS> two point three ? <EOS> four point three <EOS> no ? <EOS> well we could take out ones by making it single curved , just fill in those bits . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> and then where is the <EOS> how much would that save us ? <EOS> that will only save you one . <EOS> the other thing could be that um you could take away the l_c_d_ panel and the advanced chip together , <EOS> um because when you <EOS>
okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> and you have more pictures . <EOS> uh we have five minutes to the end of the meeting . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , maybe d uh i have just one more slide , i think . um . <EOS> like we can have a ma material such as plastic , rubber , wood , titanium , <EOS> but titanium we can't use . <EOS> um and also for electronics we can use a simple and regular um re or an advanced chip on the print , <EOS> um also infra it includes the infrared se sender . <EOS> um yeah the uh for the movie just to j develop uh samples and so spe sample speaker . <EOS> an yeah , that's it . <EOS> it's all for me now , <EOS> thank you . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> no . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> volume up , volume down , and some teletext buttons <EOS> but <EOS> yeah . <EOS> but do you need <EOS> i think if you if you only l <EOS> so we can s we can skip the display , <EOS> so uh we don't need it . <EOS>
i think it would fail , i think <EOS> it'd be a huge disaster , especially if it looks like that . <EOS> even you . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i don't <EOS> we kind of designed it to look little bit like a face . <EOS> yeah but <EOS> i know it is . <EOS>
what seems kind of ideal for me would be to just have a fairly simple , uh not fancy but not totally minimalist , i mean just pretty simple plastic , probably , <EOS> i was thinking , yellow and black , <EOS> just because that's the company's colours , <EOS> with very very few buttons , but that would correspond to a screen that would appear on the television screen , like , you know , just small along the bottom <EOS> instead of instead of having the ipod style display screen on the actual remotes , which is far too expensive . <EOS> and when you've got a screen sitting there in front of you , you might as well have it appearing uh on the screen in front of you , <EOS> it doesn't obscure much of the actual picture you're watching . <EOS>
mm you can just click . <EOS> go go . <EOS> is that right ? <EOS> no no no <EOS> you just get off that . <EOS> you just click anywhere . <EOS> ah-ha . <EOS> yeah , what for me is it um <EOS> i d i don't know what i'm marketing right now , okay , <EOS> 'til you spoke and when i wrote this , i don't know what i'm marketing . <EOS> i just know that i i was identified as a a we identified ourselves as a as a developer , as a manufacturer , and as a as a um distributor t to other wholesalers . <EOS>
mm , i think <EOS> i well <EOS> it will be alright . <EOS> i think i <EOS> what is the teletext ? <EOS> if it's necessary can you can do that . <EOS> we can integrate small microphone in the remote <EOS> so it's not really a problem . <EOS>
okay , so , i guess that was the test to see if this equipment is all working . <EOS> mm . let's move on to the next page . <EOS> okay , project finance , <EOS> selling price twenty five euros , <EOS> profit aim fifty million euros . <EOS>
supplements like different types of features buttons , like can have a f mute button or a swapping button . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> or or like her speech recognition would also be a supplement . <EOS> her speech recognition feature would be a supplement . <EOS> oh , like <EOS> oh . <EOS> a what ? <EOS> right , right , right , mm-hmm . <EOS>
yeah , and if we're going for sleek and sexy , i think a scroll wheel is maybe a bit kinda bulky ? <EOS> i i've got um pictures <EOS> well i've seen pictures with it kind of sticking off the side of it , <EOS> and they don't really look great . <EOS>
yep . <EOS> okay . <EOS> cool , groovy . <EOS> yeah . so i think overall uh evaluation of our product is quite good . <EOS> so we can launch it . yeah . <EOS> s <EOS> cool . <EOS> brilliant . <EOS> woo-hoo . <EOS> in which case we are done . <EOS> 'cause we've evaluated and we are within budget . <EOS>
yes . <EOS> okay , so <EOS> if you can add the feature , okay , for your uh fabric whatever in your outline design okay , with unbreakable , <EOS> okay , <EOS> i think that will give a lot of advantage for our product , <EOS> good idea . good idea , <EOS> i'll i'll uh um <EOS>
anyb anybody who comes here anybody who comes to your home he'll at least ask once what is this . <EOS> yeah , but it's not a positive thing . <EOS> it's a very positive thing if you see like that . <EOS> well , you know , it's it's handy , it's ergonomic , but it's a banana . <EOS>
it's pop <EOS> i don't think it's popular , <EOS> so that's the problem so . you had i if you are designing a remote control for you know <EOS> mm . <EOS> the global usage , <EOS> so if people don't have the technology . <EOS> global , <EOS> okay . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> well even um ipod thing , <EOS> like um , <EOS> i don't know if people like this <EOS> but if you want to reduce the number , of buttons , instead of having like one to nine , have a sort of <EOS> that sort of like joystick flat touch thing , yeah . <EOS>
i i think we'd be <EOS> yeah , <EOS> no , <EOS> it'd be more a case of how do we envisage us performing the product evaluation once we have a model to test with . <EOS> oh , that's the okay , sure sure sure . <EOS> um so <EOS> it'd be a case of do you think that just bringing users in to have them test it out , <EOS> uh maybe putting a certain number of products into the field in certain places <EOS> which i suppose is quite similar . <EOS> or just kind of hitting the streets and you know saying this is a new remote control , what do you think of the look of it ? um <EOS>
yeah , <EOS> or in <EOS> and use my thumb or my pointer finger on the touch scroll wheel . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> and you find that works quite well ? <EOS> i love the idea of the wheel like the ipod . <EOS> 'cause th <EOS> yeah <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS>
just very simple . <EOS> like a web browser back button . <EOS> um i dunno . <EOS> i don't have uh i did <EOS> uh yeah , <EOS> i know what it is , <EOS> but i think it's all too difficult for old people . <EOS> no . uh <EOS>
yeah . alright . <EOS> yeah , but then the remote control i think i mean <EOS> um the idea is kind of it's it's not that it's sitting there on on top of the television , <EOS> because then you could already yell at the television <EOS> and you wouldn't you you wouldn't need the remote control , <EOS> so the remote control is still something you keep n near yourself . <EOS>
are you finding it okay <EOS> or ? <EOS> i'm just closing it now . <EOS> where i've saved it . <EOS> well like if you go to one , uh whichever one you were working <EOS> yeah , <EOS> and you just click file save as . <EOS> that's it there , <EOS> yeah . <EOS> oh right . <EOS>
yeah . possible . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah <EOS> we got it down to not too many . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> um so what was the decision on the um design of the volume button ? <EOS> um <EOS> are we are we gonna go through the design of all the buttons at the moment , <EOS> or are we gonna t <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> so , do we have to include the company colour within that ? <EOS> yes . <EOS> it's part of the logo . <EOS> okay . <EOS> company colour being yellow . <EOS> what we're going to do right now is come to some decisions , definitive that we can all agree on , about um the target group and the functions <EOS> and just definite things that we need to do <EOS> and then we'll close up the meeting . <EOS> so . alright . <EOS> whatever . <EOS> okay . <EOS>
but if you move it then you have it , you don't need to find it . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> you can see the buttons better , of course . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . yeah . <EOS> yeah . true . <EOS> yeah . actually . <EOS> but if you move it then you have to have some sensor to when you move it to detect your movement . <EOS>
it's only a t_v_ . <EOS> or from from my perspective i think l_c_d_ is a mistake <EOS> because this is a universal remote <EOS> and all you're doing i mean it's you're not gonna get any information back from the television , <EOS> so the only information you can display on this remote is what channel you just sent it at last <EOS> and there's just not a lot of information , you know , there . <EOS> it receives no information . <EOS>
right . <EOS> you can also have it , maybe , talking about mobile phones again , sliding open . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> with the lesser used functions on this part , <EOS> and then it slides into that part . and out . <EOS> behind . <EOS> definitely . <EOS> just like o <EOS> on a sort of side view . something that you know it would sort of fit in the hand better . <EOS> so you know <EOS> you just sort of have your hand <EOS>
i'm thinking curved of some sort . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , okay . <EOS> we don't really know what the difference <EOS> yeah . <EOS> um okay , <EOS> interface , the type and the supplements . <EOS> so <EOS> push or scroll , <EOS> right ? <EOS> or both ? <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> no you it it not protruding actually , <EOS> it will go in better into that <EOS> okay . <EOS> well <EOS> r r <EOS> i'd say two or three for that one , personally . <EOS> mm . <EOS> probably more towards three than two . <EOS>
i <EOS> if it's got voice recognition it can be technically anywhere in your room and still do its job . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> do you think people that are people that buy a remote , are they always gonna wanna use the voice recognition <EOS> or is it just something that they do sometimes . <EOS>
'kay . <EOS> um , components . just some ideas that i had , <EOS> um , energy source , <EOS> it's kinda hip to be eco friendly <EOS> so i thought maybe we could do something with solar power with an alkaline battery backup . <EOS> um the user interface , <EOS> i was <EOS> since we can't use metal <EOS> i was thinking maybe a high grade recycled plastic . <EOS> the chip , um , silicon based chip i don't really see any way around that , <EOS> we can't really be different in that respect . <EOS> um , the sender well i'm thinking infrared <EOS> 'cause it is the industry standard , <EOS> multi channel , <EOS> that's a word i made up , <EOS> i don't really know what it means . <EOS> uh pal and n_t_s_c_ compatible <EOS> and uh probably a two hundred foot range . <EOS> uh and the receiver of course is any number of electronic devices . <EOS> um but in this case it'll only be t_v_s . <EOS> um personal preferences , <EOS> i really think that we should use plastic as opposed to metal , <EOS> um , the company simply can't afford this kinds of lawsuits <EOS> which adm admittedly is gonna come at the cost of a certain aesthetic value , <EOS> 'cause we were thinking <EOS>
yeah , neither neither do i , <EOS> but i've never seen anything <EOS> and and none of my examples were was was like this , actually , so . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i'll be looking out next time i need to write an essay . <EOS> that looks boring , i'll see if anyone's made a remote control . <EOS>
squared ? <EOS> yeah , that's right . it's really boring , yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> ah , the lemon t_v_ with the pineapple remote control . <EOS> yeah , that's that would be really interesting , actually . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . because the t_v_ you also <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> celebration time , come on . <EOS> oh . <EOS> oh . <EOS> peace out nigger . <EOS> entree <EOS>
wishing i hadn't closed the damn <EOS> right so we had the fact that we're gonna have the the logo uh the company logo in its uh colour scheme incorporated onto the the device the remote device . <EOS> we had uh made our decisions about uh made our decisions about uh the device itself , <EOS> that it was gonna be simple to make it uh enable us to complete the project in time . <EOS> we're gonna have uh effectively two pages , <EOS> a front page which had the uh features that the uh the customers most wanted , <EOS> and then the uh the backup features on the second page so that it could uh meet the technical requirements . <EOS> and the customers wouldn't have to look at them too often , <EOS> only as and when required . <EOS> so . <EOS> so basically what decisions uh have we uh made ? <EOS> uh have there been any uh changes ? <EOS>
yeah , okay . <EOS> yeah <EOS> but a you don't know <EOS> an <EOS> so , <EOS> true , true . <EOS> but uh <EOS> true . <EOS> but if you would do an l_c_d_ screen do we have don don't you have any buttons ? <EOS> or because if it only directs at the t_v_ , then you only have uh i don't know what you want to do with the l_c_d_ screen . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> content . <EOS> okay , <EOS> so these we have to work it out . <EOS> so this one of the problem . <EOS> and uh <EOS> i think that's the the things to do <EOS> and uh to uh reflect about it <EOS> the main thing . <EOS> okay . alright . <EOS>
yeah . you're right . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> and the and the second one is really uh state of the art , uh in terms of innovation . <EOS> and um with many more functionalities , <EOS> and can open and close the the bottom part . <EOS>
okay <EOS> but now you don't have that . <EOS> oh <EOS> hit f_ eight again . <EOS> sorry guys . <EOS> i know . <EOS> i did the same thing . <EOS> and then it should come up here shortly . <EOS> 'kay . <EOS> so <EOS> is there no way i can give you the slideshow and <EOS>
nee <EOS> we we also want to make ano another colour . <EOS> oh right , yeah . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> we should u <EOS> yeah . <EOS> we have to make this like four or five or something . <EOS> that's what it means . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> but m <EOS> yeah , <EOS> because we have more colours than only black . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah , that's good . <EOS> um . <EOS> i think we just say that it was gonna be the the most basic stuff possible . <EOS> um on off , up and down channels , up and down volume and uh skip to a channel . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> so where exactly is this i <EOS> ah , okay . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> did you find it ? <EOS> it's just <EOS> yeah , yeah . <EOS> yeah , yeah in that one , <EOS> right yeah . <EOS> yeah , and email them round . <EOS>
well i dunno about like the flip-phone idea , <EOS> because i think , as far as durability th it's not a big <EOS> well maybe when it's closed . <EOS> i mean what i see one of the things one of the things you brought up in an earlier presentation is , when you got children , their their stuff gets inside the circuitry , they get dirty , they get messy with drinks and stuff . <EOS> this <EOS>
yes . yes . <EOS> stress . <EOS> okay , so then uh let's come to the closing <EOS> and uh are the costs within the budget <EOS> and uh is the product evaluated , okay , so that will uh come soon . <EOS> okay for uh but our time being , so thanks for all your efforts and great work and uh great design <EOS> and uh let's leave it to the ed for later for once production is
neither was i . <EOS> well it's a trend in fashion , in clothing and um fabrics . <EOS> yeah but you're not gonna wear your remote control . <EOS> so so okay , let me get this right . <EOS> okay , uh <EOS> okay , alright anyway . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> um . so . <EOS> and also does it uh fit well in hand ? <EOS> because it was uh th your wrist problem with the usage . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> well this these uh these remotes are quite big , <EOS> so go to the next page , <EOS> so . <EOS> we have all these buttons as you can see , but most of them , we just need the ones in the middle . <EOS>
case but it's but i don't know with twenty fi okay . <EOS> um <EOS> can we go to the next presentation ? so <EOS> you had to to to summarise maybe the <EOS> well <EOS> this is now talking about um who would pay for speech recognition in a remote control , who would pay more for it , um . <EOS> ninety percent of the fifteen to twenty five year old market said that they would pay more , <EOS> it goes down from there , <EOS> seventy six percent for twenty five to thirty five , <EOS> thirty five percent for thirty five to forty five , <EOS> um twenty two percent for forty five to fifty five <EOS> and then eight percent for fifty five to sixty five . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> but we sh <EOS> yeah , <EOS> it really depends where we're gonna be targeting this product , um , <EOS> which we'll be talking about later i think . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yes . <EOS> uh uh i think that will be great . <EOS> okay . <EOS> so you think it's will be better to have a t kinda total touch screen . <EOS> yeah , i think so . <EOS> yeah , i wou i would actually go for the <EOS>
i think i'd probably increase the cost . <EOS> we've only got like what , ten cents left so <EOS> i think it'll be cost prohibitive , <EOS> yeah . <EOS> it would cost more than plastic . <EOS> okay , <EOS> logo , we've got it in there , haven't we ? <EOS>
so i think that some things that we might wanna think about , <EOS> the idea of an l_c_d_ screen was brought up <EOS> although they didn't have any details on what people's preferences on that were , <EOS> so i dunno know if that's coming to me later , or something like that . <EOS> but something for us to consider <EOS> also just the phenomenon that less is more when it comes to the buttons on the remote <EOS> or what we wanna make easiest to use , <EOS> make sure that , you know , something like an audio setting isn't given as much importance and visibility on the remote as something like channel changing that's used a lot more often . <EOS> and basically in order for us to win over to the consumer we just need to focus on what it looks like , <EOS> that it has a fancy appeal <EOS> and that it's not ugly <EOS> and that it feels like the way they're gonna use it , <EOS> so it doesn't give them any hand injuries or things like that . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> that might just so . <EOS> you can go to the next slide . <EOS> i have some kind of pictures <EOS> okay . <EOS> you know , <EOS> here . <EOS> you have the b the bulb , <EOS> it is a blue the blue stuff here <EOS> and the infrared and the infrared bulb it is the red stuff <EOS> you know <EOS> and so <EOS> and you have the other subcomponent <EOS> that are not really here so important , so . <EOS>
so . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> and what tha what about the uh materials ? <EOS> and the materials , <EOS> it depends <EOS> for example you if you have a wooden material it can be more <EOS> the plastic material is more common <EOS> it's very resistant <EOS> but , you know , something wooden will be like , i don't know high cl so a special high class , <EOS> or you know , you can have some <EOS>
but maybe they could be concave instead of sticking up to have them be kind of down <EOS> so you could feel them <EOS> mm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> better . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> that's uh <EOS> must admit i don't think i've ever seen one with concave buttons , <EOS> that's uh certainly be different . <EOS> um do we need it to uh <EOS> i can't think of any re remote controls that i know of that actually light up at all . <EOS> do we do we want uh <EOS>
oh okay , cool . <EOS> um right , so . <EOS> so it has voice control . <EOS> yes , <EOS> so that's a seven then . <EOS> um , cool . <EOS> yep . <EOS> g_ technologically innovative . <EOS> anyway it ha yeah , <EOS> it's the most sophisticated remote that i ever seen . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yep . <EOS> yes . <EOS> okay . <EOS> and the case . <EOS> and i think we all agree on the case , <EOS> we wanna have something uh maybe bright , colourful . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> bright , colourful , trendy trendy design , and strong . <EOS>
yeah . yeah . <EOS> notice the giant dog bone shape ? <EOS> also good for animals . <EOS> dunno . <EOS> and that yeah . <EOS> makes sense , makes sense . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> see . <EOS> things . <EOS> . <EOS> uh <EOS> well let's see . <EOS> i'm going to bore you with a couple of descriptions of the interior . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> um model . <EOS> and this <EOS> these are all i i i found , or i wrote down . <EOS> and um we have to discuss about , if we give it a one or a seven . <EOS> uh <EOS> okay . <EOS> uh i think uh if you have a kind of ipod idea . it quite beautiful . <EOS> it's <EOS>
yeah , that . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> 'kay any other ideas ? <EOS> um what colour ? <EOS> oh , yeah . latex covers . w <EOS> we have to make sure that logo always sticks out when we put the latex covers on , <EOS> so we'll have to like have a little square or something , so that the our logo's available . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> and uh yeah i think this is the basi <EOS> on the lower side i think it you have to turn it . <EOS> no ? <EOS> if we do that . <EOS> and do we do we have a <EOS> or a or a ball , <EOS> yeah , <EOS> not a a wheel but a ball , <EOS> and you say uh to <EOS>
mm well <EOS> i was just thinking , this this of course causes <EOS> yeah . <EOS> right on the <EOS> and your thumb would be up here type thing . <EOS> causes a problem um for left or right-handed people actually . so . <EOS> yeah that's also true . <EOS> instantly sort of always going for the right-handed person . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> and exceed the requirements they're expecting of us . <EOS> so <EOS> it <EOS> really exceed the requirements , <EOS> 'cause the requirements really are just want to be able to change channels and functions , <EOS> which is more a text on the screen thing than uh than actual buttons <EOS> o <EOS> i was thinking something some smooth , sleek , little remote control with big user-friendly buttons and uh a menu that you can access . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> but <EOS> but it's not t t t too expensive to put a touchscreen on it . <EOS> but that's <EOS> yeah , i think it's much uh too expensive . <EOS> uh like a a to have <EOS> yeah , maybe it would . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> so <EOS> we we also have to have a led li led light on it ? <EOS> yeah . i i think so . <EOS> i i'm not sure if it's the same thing . <EOS> uh <EOS> j is <EOS> ain't it just to to indicate that it's transmitting ? <EOS>
looks like it . <EOS> okay . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> then it should have a next button , <EOS> and next button channel by which you can keep on uh v uh mm eh scrolling the channels one by one . <EOS> next slide , please . <EOS> going to the nex next . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS>
yeah <EOS> i didn't receive any info uh . <EOS> and it's also more fun yeah . <EOS> i always chuck my uh remote control around , so <EOS> yeah , just playing with it <EOS> and especially when the material's rubber . it can be done , i mean , you can't harm it , <EOS> so it's a perfect combination i guess . <EOS>
uh <EOS> alright . <EOS> that's the idea , <EOS> so <EOS> uh . your line broke . <EOS> yeah . alright . <EOS> it's not that fast . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah <EOS> it's a bit slow , <EOS> so <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i see . <EOS> it misses the spot . <EOS>
mm-mm . <EOS> but is there any other <EOS> i mean okay , that's true for the for for that element , <EOS> but we have to take all el elements into consideration . <EOS> and so if there is one element that requires the more expensive one , or say the regular one , or the more advanced , then that would have to be the same for all of them . s <EOS>
okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> but we can like think of five , six designs . <EOS> right , i think we have to round it up , um <EOS> can i just quickly um go over the new project requirements so that i haven't missed anything . <EOS> so it's no teletext , <EOS> it's only for t_v_ and by implication video , <EOS> our corporate image should be incorporated in the remote control , <EOS> um something about videoplus . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> and then we're going to uh try to finish our project , <EOS> and uh make a good design for all the grandfathers and grandmothers , i think . <EOS> which are <EOS> uh let's see . <EOS> i'm not sure if you're going to start right away to work together <EOS> or <EOS> i think you're going to fill in the questionnaires first . <EOS> and then you'll get a message . <EOS>
to produce each one . <EOS> per ? <EOS> piece . <EOS> oh you guys are always the dampers on these projects . <EOS> i know <EOS> mm . <EOS> you industrial designers . <EOS> i know . <EOS> it's fun . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> and our goal was to be under twelve fifty <EOS> or we have to be under twelve fifty ? <EOS> do we remember ? <EOS>
i always want to have you know , <EOS> sometime i want to have wire <EOS> because you know . <EOS> yeah <EOS> but as industrial designer , do you think that it will be feasible to have uh linked or to have link between the remote control and the television ? <EOS> i'm just asking you . <EOS> do you think it will be cheaper ? <EOS>
no that's that's too busy i guess . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> uh partly but you have to print on the number . or the the sign . <EOS> so you can't <EOS> okay . <EOS> change the colour so <EOS> you better bet better better keep the led and the button itself in the same colour i guess . <EOS> so just an extra <EOS>
right . <EOS> um it said it could talk to you , but it never said anything about being able to listen . <EOS> i it said something about a sensor but never clarified that . <EOS> so maybe if you <EOS> well i could see the other email that they sent you , <EOS> um 'cause they got back to me with like different requirements , or different offerings of what components availa <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> and again we have another another great marketing tool . <EOS> we have about three we have three or four things here . <EOS> that's not gonna be too expensive <EOS> because that's gonna be you're gonna be able to nab that off of computer mouse manufacturers really . <EOS> you could basically come up with a partnership to be able to produce that quite cheaply . <EOS>
um well the trend-watchers i consulted advised that it b should be , the remote control and the docking station should be telephone-shaped . <EOS> so you could imagine that uh the remote control will be standing up straight in the docking station . <EOS> this is not really <EOS> this is pretty much a new shape to uh older people . <EOS> so they would prefer uh a design where the remote control just lies flat in the docking station . <EOS> so it would be kinda more telephone-shaped . <EOS>
there you go . <EOS> but is everyone's called functional requirements ? <EOS> no , <EOS> they're all called something slightly different . <EOS> technical requirements and something something , yeah . <EOS> so , if you put them in there , we'll all be able to see them and refer to them if we need to . <EOS>
and maybe <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> no . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yes . <EOS> um . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> so th the question really is how do we feel with the project process ? <EOS> uh , um are we happy with the creativity that has passed here <EOS> or we're not happy with the new product we created or that was created ? <EOS> uh i think <EOS> personally i think uh i'm pretty happy . <EOS>
i know it's probably like um not an issue to raise here , but um the whole thing about not using your standby uh because of the like waste of electricity . <EOS> have you seen the adverts ? <EOS> like if you boil the kettle that's full that's a waste . <EOS> if you leave your telly on standby it powers blackpool for a certain amount of time . <EOS> like we should maybe try to discourage people from standby . <EOS>
yeah yeah . <EOS> uh of course the u_i_d_ mark will be uh focused on the user interface concept <EOS> and uh our m market expert sammy benjo uh on the trend watching . <EOS> mark will <EOS> so um <EOS> of course like before specific instruction will be sent to you by your personal personal coach . <EOS> well <EOS> i think that's all . <EOS>
certainly by the next meeting . <EOS> by next meeting , okay that will be great . <EOS> uh okay , <EOS> so there's any questions or uh first of all about uh this project ? <EOS> what is the goal of the project ? <EOS> uh the goal of the project i think maybe i'll uh hand out to the ed , okay , <EOS> so to explain uh what is the project because he's in the sales and the accounting . <EOS>
yeah comfortable headsets would be nice . <EOS> yeah less sore on the ears . <EOS> well i i mean <EOS> clearly remote control microphones would be the would be a nice solution to all these cables , <EOS> but i'm sure that there's there's some justification for these things that i don't know about . <EOS> and of course i did not have so much fun with my computer this afternoon . <EOS> it's not been uh it's not been cooperating so well , <EOS> but i don't think that's the <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> do we need um let me <EOS> is that agreeable to everyone ? <EOS> br actually , um <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> the enter key <EOS> i have a chart here that i didn't include . um <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> do you want the gizmo ? <EOS>
um it's not very clear up there , <EOS> but you can see some of them have got kind of bulges , like the second one and the end one uh where there's a curve there . <EOS> i'm not exactl <EOS> i don't know if a double curve is maybe it comes up slightly , or ? <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> well , that's it , i mean <EOS> yeah , but i mean everything has been used in space before it gets to anyone else really , hasn't it ? <EOS> so , i don't think many peop <EOS> space remote . <EOS> that's it , they can take it with them . <EOS>
do sol solar panel things , do they have to work from the sun or can they work from a light bulb ? <EOS> mm . <EOS> i dunno actually . <EOS> does anybody know ? <EOS> uh i think , it has to be on the on the solar energy , but i don't know . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so are we talking of a single model or maybe five , six designs ? <EOS> sure . <EOS> well y yeah you could you could have a number of different designs <EOS> i mean inside they'd be essentially exactly the same . <EOS>
yeah , that's on the t_v_ , yeah . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> and then y <EOS> well i mean <EOS> on a <EOS> onto like a mouse , the ru the scrolling button , is actually a button as well , <EOS> you could press it , you could press that and have it as a menu button . <EOS>
well <EOS> at least right now what we're doing is um deciding on just the remote itself , <EOS> so it will probably be sold separately , twenty five euro by itself . <EOS> right . <EOS> right , okay . <EOS> the only break-down that i was given in terms of age was the voice activation <EOS> and basically there's a big jump , <EOS> after thirty five people don't really care if it has voice , <EOS> so it's like basically fifteen to thirty five that think that that's a good idea . <EOS> i dunno i'm gonna be given any other numbers broken down in terms of age later , <EOS> but if that's sort of the only quality that we have that is divided into age then we would wanna stick between the fifteen and thirty five range . <EOS>
yes . <EOS> yes . <EOS> well , yeah , <EOS> we'll skip that for now . uh okay . <EOS> so that's uh i have to to ask , <EOS> so you don't really feel um very strongly attached to this uh grouping by projects idea ? <EOS> mm-hmm . um <EOS>
mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> really annoying . <EOS> okay . so there we are again . <EOS> by your humble p_m_ . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay this is the agenda . <EOS> um we have three presentations , i heard . <EOS> really . <EOS> yeah really . <EOS> so who wants to start ? <EOS>
no . yeah . <EOS> to light it all up . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> but <EOS> but yeah . mayb okay . <EOS> yeah , just backlight . <EOS> not not the buttons . <EOS> and th and the the normal backlights also not the buttons , but behind the buttons . <EOS> so the buttons are just grey . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> may not be th as functional . <EOS> so for that there's <EOS> okay , so <EOS> unfortunately we've got about five minutes here to come up with our um remote control idea and start rolling with it . <EOS> um we've talked about our experiences with remote control <EOS> and um we've got a couple ideas um . <EOS>
battery's low , <EOS> isn't it the ink ? <EOS> the b <EOS> that's the that that one ? <EOS> battery there . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> but <EOS> no no it's not that , <EOS> it's how to close a battery . <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay ? <EOS> now it should be . <EOS>
yes yes , <EOS> i have that too . <EOS> mm . <EOS> um . <EOS> it's it's easy to learn or how do you say it's <EOS> thirty four percent said it took too much time to learn to use a new one . yep . <EOS> okay too much time to learn . okay . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> okay . <EOS> this is the bit that the email messed up for me <EOS> and that's what i was fiddling about with at the beginning of the thing . <EOS> okay , cool . <EOS> so um okay , <EOS> so this is what people find annoying about remote controls . <EOS> uh that they get lost , <EOS> that the uh you know , they're not intuitive <EOS> and that they're bad for repetitive strain injury . <EOS> i think if you're watching enough t_v_ to get repetitive strain injury from um you know , watching t_v_ , then that's the least of your problems , <EOS> but you know , it's up there . <EOS> um that yeah . <EOS> okay , so um i mean the the r_s_i_ thing would be that , like when you have the computer keyboards and you keep your wrists up would be something that encourages <EOS> you want something with an ergonomic t design that encourages good use of the remote control <EOS> and you know , not straining your wrists watching t_v_ . <EOS>
with a scroll wheel , <EOS> right ? <EOS> is he integrated ? <EOS> no , <EOS> eh ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i don't know . <EOS> push button . <EOS> no , we don't have push button . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> we gotta integrate scroll wheel and push button , <EOS> because when you push it and you w it won't just pu uh makes possible to s <EOS>
okay . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> sure . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> pad . <EOS> right um . <EOS> so at this point we uh , <EOS> let me see , <EOS> discuss uh how satisfied we all are with um with these four points , <EOS> with the room for creativity in the project , and leadership and teamwork , <EOS> and the stuff we had around us i guess . <EOS> um , <EOS> let me see uh <EOS>
wow . <EOS> yep . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> well <EOS> it's easier to just make that one cheaper by just taking the speech recognition out . <EOS> that'll basically take us down to the budget . <EOS> yes , well <EOS> but i'm <EOS> now <EOS> did y did you work with the same prices that i have here ? <EOS>
well for the volume you have to press the middle , and then go up . <EOS> okay . that's what i mean . okay . <EOS> okay so you have to like press this middle region and then you can scroll up , go up and down . <EOS> oh . <EOS>
yeah , think so . <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
it's <EOS> i mean this doesn't have uh the power to do recognition , for example . <EOS> well <EOS> y y you have also the language problem , <EOS> you know <EOS> when you <EOS> no <EOS> it's uh <EOS> even for the f um because the the vocabulary the <EOS>
mm . <EOS> is it possible <EOS> uh i'm just gonna bring up the idea of colours . <EOS> is these are these the colours that of production , or is this just what we had available ? <EOS> well i'm <EOS> we're gonna have again the the sort of the foggy um yellow from last time that lit up when you pushed the button . <EOS>
how about uh management or something . <EOS> who happens to be your friend . <EOS>
that would be me . <EOS> um cord ? <EOS> ah <EOS> of course , <EOS> sorry . <EOS> no problem . <EOS> whoosh . <EOS> can you reach , <EOS> that would be great , <EOS> thank you . <EOS> yep . <EOS> that'd be great <EOS> i didn't even do that one on purpose either , <EOS> damn . <EOS> okay , um , <EOS> basically i was just evaluating um from what we know of how our product's working right now with the criteria that we set at the beginning of <EOS> these are the things we needed to do , <EOS> these are the things that look like we feel they're important . <EOS> um so i was looking at basic design things , <EOS> does it fulfil its functions as a remote ? <EOS> is the design what we wanted it to do ? <EOS> i <EOS> are technologies up to where we hoped they would be <EOS> and does it fulfil the aesthetic qualities that our original market research was looking for ? um . <EOS>
yeah , it's pretty exciting . <EOS> so , <EOS> everything uh that we wanted <EOS> we wanted it to be ergonomic and to be made out of rubber , <EOS> very simple and easy to use , <EOS> yeah , double curved , <EOS> um but also something that was gonna jump out at people , <EOS> something that would be different uh , <EOS> separate it from the other remotes out on the market . <EOS> so uh i think if you put this in the palm of your hand , you'll see what a nice thing we have going here . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> um <EOS> consistency . <EOS> oh <EOS> i have that those s numbers . <EOS> i here is our here are uh <EOS> or a good watch . <EOS> b <EOS> i don't really know . <EOS> everybody's searching in his data . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> channel selection . per hour one hundred and sixty eight . <EOS> volume selection four times an hour <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> oh , good idea . <EOS> very good . <EOS> okay , let's move on . <EOS> yeah . that's right . <EOS> so you're two ? <EOS> that's right . <EOS> okay . <EOS> so this is going to be about the component design . <EOS> so first thing is we need power source for the remote control . <EOS> so i was of the idea that we can have two kind of power supplies , <EOS> one is the usual batteries which are there , <EOS> they could be chargeable batteries if there's a basis station kind of thing <EOS> and on top of that we can have solar cells , <EOS> when the lighting conditions are good they can be used so it'll be pretty uh innovative kind . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> right . <EOS> yeah , because i mean anyway , right-handed people would be able to scroll with it , <EOS> so i if the majority are right-handed , it's uh <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i mean you can you can use your finger to to scroll rather than your thumb . <EOS> so i mean that does kind of negate the whole r_s_i_ issue . <EOS> so maybe we need to put that needs a little bit of investigation , <EOS> maybe give it a five , i would say ? <EOS> what do you what do you all think ? <EOS>
yeah , <EOS> but it i we don't wanna have a ar an <EOS> how do you call it ? accu . <EOS> a recha <EOS> oh no . <EOS> uh battery . it's just a battery . yeah . <EOS> re recharger . base station . <EOS> y <EOS> uh just just batteries , rechargeable batteries . <EOS>
yeah . uh as an option maybe . <EOS> and so the buttons we have , <EOS> this is , yeah , this is normal . <EOS> we put in the the simple buttons on the top , <EOS> and probably the the the more complicated buttons down there . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> oh <EOS> it's <EOS> that's a that's a good idea . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm-mm . <EOS> right , okay <EOS> i think we've got um a good idea now . <EOS> we uh <EOS> meeting is uh <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah true . <EOS>
there's our ghost mouse again . <EOS> that that means that you can have a little trouble with , little trouble with the air conditioning , <EOS> that's because of this uh <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> it's in wing c_ and e_ . <EOS> so <EOS> it should be over in a in a while , couple of days . <EOS> but it's going to be cold anyway , <EOS> so i don't think you're gonna need it . <EOS> then our agenda . <EOS> now <EOS> first the opening . <EOS> uh this time i will take the minutes . <EOS>
okay , <EOS> from the marketing yeah , from the marketing side , just to to give an idea what the management is looking for , i was looking for a a remote control to have a s <EOS> s 'scuse me for one sec . <EOS> i have a sales price of twenty-five euro , <EOS> with a production price of uh twelve and a half euro . <EOS> for what uh i think from what we're trying to find , we're tr we're looking for , i don't think that price is exactly in the market . <EOS> okay ? <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> what do you reckon , five , six ? <EOS> . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> what do you all think ? <EOS> six ? <EOS> six . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i mean how how far can you go with a remote control , really ? <EOS> it still has to do what i what it has to do . <EOS>
what interface ? <EOS> yeah , <EOS> for the interface something added value . <EOS> i think the supplement can be the voice . <EOS> it is just , you know , it is not the most important , but it can be a part of <EOS> with a module ? you mean the remote control with a mur module if you want you can just use <EOS>
so , <EOS> here we've got two examples <EOS> where here on the left-hand side , you can see a remote control that has lots and lots of buttons . <EOS> the buttons , in a lot of cases , are tiny . <EOS> um they're hard to see , <EOS> and okay , <EOS> they're labelled , <EOS> but the labels don't necessarily tell you too much . <EOS> whereas , on the other side , you have a much simpler remote control <EOS> that i think basically has the minimum functionalities that are needed . <EOS> and it sort of looks simpler and just less imposing when you first look at it . <EOS> so , i would be inclined to go sort of towards this , in terms of design , rather than this . <EOS> and if there's specific functionalities that require more buttons , then we can figure out how to do it with existing um buttons . <EOS>
it would have to be attached . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah okay . <EOS> yeah just a thought <EOS> they wouldn't actually need one and they could use anything they've got , <EOS> couldn't they ? <EOS> a pencil or a pen , <EOS> so they wouldn't really need a <EOS>
so we have to go through now evaluations . <EOS> evalua yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so your slides are ready ? <EOS> s <EOS> uh you're four i think . <EOS> so this is one , which one is this one ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
'cause if you're thinking about holding it you would be using your thumbs to press , just like a mobile phone . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> no you'd hold it you don't if you flip it open then you'd be <EOS> wouldn't you ? <EOS> isn't that the idea ? <EOS> you us <EOS> if we just use the shell as an example again , you open that , you've got your l_c_d_ display there and you've got the buttons there so you're holding it in the palm of your hand , yeah . <EOS>
yeah that's fine . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> we have to start it right away ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> uh this is you ? <EOS> functional ? yeah functional requirements . <EOS> 'kay . <EOS> alright . <EOS> i'm gonna talk about functional requirements . <EOS> um <EOS> well uh some research has be done uh has been done . <EOS> uh observing of one hundred uh subjects in the usability lab using a remote control . <EOS> uh and they also filled in a questionnaire . <EOS> the findings were um , well you can see them for yourself . <EOS> they disliked the look-and-feel of current remotes controls . <EOS> users think they're ugly . <EOS> um they do not match the the operating behaviour of the users . <EOS> so they they d they don't match what they want to have on it . <EOS> um <EOS> they are often lost somewhere in the room . <EOS> um it takes too much time to learn how to use a new remote control . <EOS> and they're bad for r_s_i_ . <EOS> i don't know uh how a user can reach that but okay . <EOS> um <EOS> there is also uh was also some research on uh the most relevant and and and irrelevant uh f functions . <EOS> uh most irrelevant and less used were audio settings , mono , stereo , uh pitch , bass . <EOS> um screen settings for brightness and colour and stuff like that . <EOS> um but they are used . <EOS> i mean the <EOS>
so okay , so <EOS> first have to show you , <EOS> maybe you can come here to have a look how it works . <EOS> yes ? <EOS> okay . <EOS> this a new page , <EOS> it's okay . <EOS> use pen format . <EOS> ah i can see it now . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> but it's just an idea . <EOS> i dunno what you think about , but <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i dunno if it can fit with the technology . <EOS> you are the specialists of that . <EOS> you mean banana . <EOS> well , but <EOS> if it's if it <EOS> if the banana is big enough . <EOS>
mm , maybe it's a good idea . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> oh yeah . <EOS> like uh phones . <EOS> different colours . <EOS> okay , <EOS> so y you just make it th through you look through it ? <EOS> okay . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> a see-through . mm , that's cool . <EOS>
um . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> right . <EOS> can i ask , <EOS> are we designing a remote control for a television only <EOS> um , and if if this device is just to be used for the television <EOS> good question . <EOS>
region where people have more than one television in a home ? mm . i think we've got a big hill to climb here , haven't we ? <EOS> i mean we've gotta persuade people who've got a remote control 'cause it came with the telly that they should buy our product instead . <EOS>
yeah , <EOS> maybe it should have a light so that we can , we can just recognise where it is . <EOS> yeah , yeah . <EOS> exactly , i mean just that's what i'm saying . <EOS> i'm just saying throw signal meaning just whether it's a beep or whether a light or <EOS>
is there any fruit that is spongy ? <EOS> i don't think so . <EOS> i think we we can have like yeah a pear is good , fit well , or banana as you told . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> and for maybe look and feel , what about a a piece of ice , <EOS>
oh right , right , right , um <EOS> okay . <EOS> nothin <EOS> okay , something is coming up . <EOS> oh , there it is , yeah . <EOS> it'll come up , <EOS> it <EOS> um uh no signal . <EOS> now it's coming , <EOS> computer no signal . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> it was <EOS> just doesn't work . <EOS> well uh smart board would be very uh nice to work with , if it worked really well . <EOS> just not work too slow . <EOS> yeah , more accurate . <EOS> digital pen or <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , i if if it would be faster , it would be great . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> mm . <EOS> so rubber would be okay . <EOS> i think rubber's <EOS> rubber , we're all we're all going we're all liking that idea ? <EOS> you think you can market that ? <EOS> but after my after my fashion thing , i think you'll realise that rubber is more <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> like the f like a plotters or something , <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yep yep yep yep yep . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so <EOS> you don't think the smartboard is is really useful <EOS> or <EOS> but <EOS> it's useful , but not m <EOS>
no , that's a good idea . <EOS> yeah , it's always black or yeah . <EOS> mm mm-mm . <EOS> no . <EOS> but how gonna <EOS> okay , <EOS> just uh but it's uh monochrome it's n it's not like <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , yeah . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> and , know whether we go down the fruit and veg route , <EOS> and i don't suggest we make it look like a banana , <EOS> but um know sort of the the organic , you know , curved look , <EOS> you know , <EOS> t to deliberately get away from the uh um uh you know , the the the the square look of most um current uh remotes <EOS> and , you know , whether whether the you know , the the fixed part of it is the corporate yellow . um <EOS>
i don't think so . <EOS> participant one . participant one . <EOS> interface concept . <EOS> no . <EOS> hmm . mm mm . <EOS> oh . <EOS> maybe i record recorded directly on the computer . <EOS> yeah . uh . <EOS> dunno . nope . <EOS> it seems that we have a problem with the <EOS>
are you talking about the picture ? <EOS> that's not our that's not our b design , <EOS> that's just a that's just something he a a graphic he used to show you the layout of what the layout of the buttons might be like . <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay 'cause 'cause right now i don't have too much to say about how to market this product <EOS> because we don't have a product to market yet . <EOS> and uh from from talking to mike is that we have we have uh we can market a more expensive product now . <EOS>
thank you . <EOS> thanks . <EOS> thank you . <EOS> okay , see you later . bye . <EOS>
you can make it m larger . <EOS> maybe it's easier to to draw uh <EOS> yeah . <EOS> this'll take forever . <EOS> it's fun to work with this pen . <EOS> um so , larger . <EOS> oh . <EOS> wrong one . <EOS> yeah that's that's the basic idea . yeah . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> on the left uh top yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah but that depends on where you put the screen . <EOS> but it's essential that there is a screen . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah <EOS> i mean the position of the screen is also more essential than <EOS> i mean we we look where we have space left and then put the logo over there . <EOS> but um <EOS>
yeah , no problem . yep . <EOS> i don't know . <EOS> um , <EOS> i think b <EOS> because we don't have a lot of buttons on the one screen , <EOS> i think the buttons <EOS> yeah , <EOS> but but or like you have <EOS> you only have channel button or volume button . <EOS> those buttons you can you can <EOS>
okay . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so your your opinion is that we should go for special condition technologies ? <EOS> because <EOS> yeah <EOS> the reason is that if we go into the market means <EOS> though i don't have much idea , <EOS> but as he the uh marketing expert presentation was <EOS>
what did you say your title was again ? <EOS> n n <EOS> uh , i'm your industrial designer , <EOS> so i b well , <EOS> the point is <EOS> you're the the industrial designer . <EOS> that <EOS> well <EOS> maybe i dunno . <EOS> the shape is perhaps not the most ideal . <EOS> as as stable as it is , <EOS> there must be a compromise between um stability and design here , so . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> sure , yeah . <EOS> no , <EOS> i just wondering whether that you had any sort of <EOS> i like titanium . <EOS> it's light . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> expensive . <EOS> uh yeah <EOS> but uh who who said who said we were , <EOS> you know , <EOS> nobody told me how mu what our financial objective is , so um <EOS>
a battery in it , kinda . <EOS> right , <EOS> so so <EOS> the unirs the user interface <EOS> uh the canonical user interface for these would be just a bunch of buttons , <EOS> but since we're a cutting edge company , we uh of course will have alternatives like uh speech recognition , whistling recognition and rocket power <EOS>
yeah yeah , <EOS> what paul already said . <EOS> uh on on top are the the basic options on top , <EOS> and if you fold it open <EOS> yeah , just for the t_v_ and just the normal function , that's fine . <EOS> yeah , yeah . <EOS>
's to do now is to decide how to fulfil what your stuff is , <EOS> so in that sense <EOS> so it does kind of make sense , yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah , sure . <EOS> it kinda does make sense , doesn't it , <EOS> because when we get into the end of meeting we're kind of talking about action and design as opposed to background . <EOS> everything i have is kinda background . <EOS>
yeah , <EOS> i don't think you use that . <EOS> y only when you want to go to <EOS> yeah , <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> just use uh when you wanna switch between channels all the time . <EOS> and how do you want to uh do it , like if you have a channel above ten ? <EOS> normally you can press one , zero or <EOS>
third part uh i don't remember <EOS> which is not very good . <EOS> ah of course , <EOS> how to to design this uh this <EOS> yeah . <EOS> nice stuff <EOS> so um <EOS> let's go for the three presentations , <EOS> so first um marketing expert . <EOS>
i i think we can speak , uh we can skip speech recognition uh directly , <EOS> because it's not reachable for twenty five euros . <EOS> um then <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> it's too <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i have my personal uh preference . <EOS> okay , <EOS> that's not very good , <EOS> because i thought about television , d_v_d_ player , stereo and v_c_r_ . <EOS> i had a question about . <EOS> but it's already out of the question , this . <EOS> um my point is , well , i if we ma uh make a a remote uh control for only television , i think it's hard to uh sell it for twenty five euros . <EOS> but it's the exercise . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> that'll <EOS> yeah , exactly . <EOS> mm . <EOS> the selling point , yeah . <EOS> we could do that , <EOS> because all our research shows that people are definitely willing to spend more if <EOS> are we restricted by this ? <EOS>
i wanna see a <EOS> i <EOS> yeah . <EOS> 'cause it's such a functional item . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> and then the final would be like th the actual specified prototype or whatever , <EOS> i dunno . <EOS> but . <EOS> mm . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> all in all it's kinda interesting . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> problem with connectors ? <EOS> do you want me to sum <EOS> o i think it's not <EOS> yeah it's it's funny . <EOS> no . <EOS> i think it it kind of you just lose information if you sum it , so . <EOS> okay <EOS> . so let's move uh let's move on . <EOS> okay , now now we have to mm to estimate uh the cost okay <EOS> . so i prepare an excel sh uh an excel sheet . <EOS> um well we are going to calculate the production costs . <EOS> we should we should be below twelve point five . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> i think it's the uh h it's their capabili i mean they it can hold what like five thousand songs or something . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i'm thinking we could <EOS> if if we're hav so ba <EOS> i mean but an ipod just has that circle thing you know . <EOS>
okay uh , <EOS> my name is uh danny wolfs . <EOS> i'm the project manager . <EOS> what's your name ? <EOS> i'm juergen toffs . <EOS> i'm the user interface designer . <EOS> user interface , okay . <EOS> hi , <EOS> my name's uh . <EOS> i'm the industrial designer . <EOS>
yeah , <EOS> so uh <EOS> probably when he was little he got lots of attention for doing it and has forever been conditioned . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> maybe . <EOS> maybe . <EOS> right , um where did you find this ? <EOS> just down here ? yeah . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> well , <EOS> th that's that's really a step further . <EOS> but if you say uh is it uh uh one way or multi-purpose , that's a <EOS> okay . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> uh tha that's a same step further . <EOS> yeah , actually it is . <EOS>
um not really , <EOS> it would make it hard to turn the machine off , to turn your t_v_ off . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> if you pressed and held it maybe . <EOS> yeah yeah , that that'd be one way of doing it , yeah . that'd work , yeah . <EOS>
'kay . <EOS> ye <EOS> small . <EOS> right . <EOS> do you guys have any ideas for what it should look like ? <EOS> maybe we could draw it up on the on the board over there . <EOS> some ideas ? <EOS> we want it to be a b a ball , <EOS> you know , <EOS> we'll draw up we'll draw up the ball <EOS> and maybe th um where the buttons are located . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yep . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> expensive buttons <EOS> yeah , <EOS> to make some new <EOS> yeah . <EOS> and i sup i think we'll have to evaluate th the product too . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> no not forgetting about the fruits and vegetables trends . <EOS>
really ? <EOS> that i didn't know . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> that's the reason ed is here . <EOS> i think he can promote the the brand value and the product value . <EOS> yes . <EOS> that's right . <EOS> it's gonna be very important to the company . <EOS>
you wanna go to the next slide ? <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah right away . <EOS> okay , well uh obviously my method for uh s m the marketing of this thing is first to ask the big question , will it sell ? <EOS> and i think we should show this prototype to people from various age and socio-economic groups <EOS> and see about any fine tuning that maybe little things we haven't thought of . <EOS> we can't accept every suggestion of course , <EOS> but maybe we just need to get a few . <EOS> and show the the prototype to consumer research groups , <EOS> we don't s want somebody to suddenly come to us and tell us that this button is toxic and you know some child will swallow it and then we won't sell any . <EOS> so we have to get some input from those people . <EOS> and then after that we just have to go with our best intuition <EOS> and you know we like it , we think it's good , we're gonna get behind it and sell it . <EOS> um , next slide please . <EOS>
um well what i found was that uh th the actual use of the remote control is to send messages to television set , <EOS> how you uh d <EOS> what you described uh just early . <EOS> and this can be all sorts of medsa messages , <EOS> turn it on , <EOS> turn it off , <EOS> uh change the channel , <EOS> adjust volume , that kind of thing . <EOS> uh play video , teletext , <EOS> but also t uh play c_d_ <EOS> if you use it your c_d_ player the remote control will that one . <EOS>
no , okay . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> no , <EOS> and if you look now at their uh the the current division of the offices , for example , uh bruno and agnes are sharing an office <EOS> and they're working on totally different projects <EOS> and and they're they're just fine with that . <EOS>
hello , <EOS> uh this meeting we are it's fo should be focused on the conceptual design of the remote control . <EOS> hello . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> hello . <EOS> um the goal of this meeting is to reach a decision at the end on the concept <EOS> and i think the last time we talked about an a lot and we had a rough idea of what is going to be , <EOS> but uh in th at the end of this meeting we have to to reach a decision . <EOS> so , uh <EOS> we will have again three presentation , from all of you , <EOS> and uh i hope it will be fast because i would like to have time to for long discussion and and decisions . <EOS> so , who wants to start ? <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> so um i'm glad i didn't d do any work um ahead of time <EOS> because uh i clearly didn't understand the project goal . <EOS> okay . <EOS> um i just did s see that we were starting a new project together <EOS> and there was going to be a four member team composed of these people , <EOS> and um that's about uh that's <EOS> and i i read through the different steps , and what my responsibilities were relative to the steps . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> 'cause i was like googling <EOS> and then i'm like wait it won't let me google . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> alright um <EOS> no , <EOS> how do i play again ? <EOS> um the <EOS> it's right above draw . <EOS> there are three thingy if <EOS> it's way at the bottom . under three icons <EOS> and it's the one that looks like a desk . <EOS> yeah , that one . <EOS> there are y_s . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> what about lighting adaptive options ? <EOS> according to the re to the new requirements i think we don't need that . <EOS> yeah as discussed in the earlier meeting , but i think uh not much people are really interested in this point if it's not really required . <EOS>
no that's fine , that's fine . okay , yeah i'll go first . <EOS> can i grab the <EOS> unplug me . thanks . <EOS> what do i have to press ? <EOS> oh , f_ eight ? <EOS> um , f_n_ function f_ eight . oh right , yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> maybe <EOS>
i think we need like some general discussion at the end probably . <EOS> yeah , i think that will do . <EOS> okay , so do you want to <EOS> yeah , okay . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> i think since since we were discussing some um design issues then i i i would like to continue <EOS> okay , yeah . <EOS>
okay , <EOS> three presentations , <EOS> um you can go in any order you choose um . <EOS> mm shall we go in the order that you just did it ? <EOS> sure , please do . <EOS> i dunno . <EOS> how do i hook my screen up ? <EOS>
it's it's a bad idea , so . <EOS> um <EOS> two ? <EOS> one . <EOS> that's fine . that's fine . <EOS> one s one scroll wheel , so <EOS> and the vocal chord , it's fine . <EOS> it i th it's fine . <EOS> okay . okay . agree . <EOS>
yeah yeah yeah . <EOS> yeah sure . <EOS> yeah not exactly legs but stumpy stuff . <EOS> more like fins or <EOS> it's more like a tank . <EOS> yeah <EOS> that's fins <EOS> but i don't know where . <EOS> they kind of l look like mole legs . with sharp nails on . <EOS>
yeah the well i think were we're going for the l_c_d_ on that one , on the buttons , <EOS> on the on the on on the top one we're gonna <EOS> yeah . <EOS> on the top one okay you've got the touch <EOS> okay <EOS> and then <EOS> on the bottom we were gonna have the rubber , the rubber ones , <EOS> the anti-r_s_i_ ones . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> feel good meaning what ? <EOS> physically , <EOS> okay . <EOS> like does it feel good , like <EOS> yeah , physically . <EOS> right . <EOS> sqi <EOS> that's just for current trend . <EOS> it doesn't really count , you guys . <EOS> right . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah , i think . <EOS> titanium . <EOS> it's mentioned here uh . <EOS> titanium , uh i think it's too expensive . <EOS> but maybe the form has to be a bit different . <EOS> not the sh the square form . <EOS> just a bit <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> and then uh infrared bulbs . <EOS> um this is like uh when it is dark . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah , mm-hmm . mm-hmm . <EOS> and battery , there should be a battery for power supply , <EOS> and a chip , <EOS> chip which is like a brain to the remote controller which does all the operations , <EOS> and wires connecting all chips , which is uh lights , everything , <EOS> so there should be wires . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> so i think what we're doing is we're trying to take like <EOS> if for me this is sorta like three different different um inspirations , you know , <EOS> one is that we want uh something that's high-tech but we want it to seem easy . <EOS> and in spite of the primitive side of it and the very high-tech side , we want it to just be an appealing piece of equipment in people's hands . <EOS> um , <EOS> frustrations . <EOS> they get lost a lot , <EOS> s as it came up in our last meeting . <EOS> um , takes time to learn how to use them . <EOS> this is uh why i mention when craig was uh showing us some ideas that we actually try and group controls , <EOS> so d it doesn't just look like a big panel , <EOS> kinda like when you you look at , you know , a new computer keyboard , <EOS> or something that is quite explanatory . <EOS> if you want audio , if you want visual , then you have those . <EOS> um <EOS> and i will admit i don't know what r_s_i_ stands for . <EOS>
i've put my files in the shared folder as well . <EOS> brilliant . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> that's fab guys . cool . <EOS>
you know , <EOS> you <EOS> volume up . volume down . change the channel , you know channel up , channel down ? <EOS> i i don't know . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay . um let's see here . <EOS> do you wanna put your cord back in ? <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> mm . mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yes it will appeal to sections of the market def <EOS> um , but quite , um , easily labelled so that anyone can oh yeah that's obvious what that's for <EOS> and it's not daunting to maybe the older generations , um <EOS>
oop . <EOS> um , my own preferences , i prefer the the clunky one . <EOS> um it's very easy to use . <EOS> um but unfortunately it does lack the advanced functions <EOS> which i i quite like having on the controls . <EOS> um so i believe the the advanced functions should maybe be hidden in a drawer , <EOS> or something like tha from the bottom of it . <EOS> so , now i'd like to ask for your preferences . <EOS> um not sure of how long we've got , uh <EOS>
yeah <EOS> i kinda had a a kinda a natural kind of a idea <EOS> where it's like more of a kind of like a kinda maybe slightly like thinner , <EOS> yeah , kinda like that <EOS> kinda like a flower or a plant <EOS> for the more natural kinda <EOS>
no , <EOS> it is the scroll wheel , i guess . <EOS> no no no . <EOS> s advanced chip . <EOS> no <EOS> then we have to scrap everything we got <EOS> because how many colours we gonna make ? <EOS> five ? <EOS> then we have two . <EOS>
and it's presumably gonna need a little speaker in it or something like that as well to beep . <EOS> that's true yeah . <EOS> but i guess a little tiny speaker is gonna be quite cheap , <EOS> it's not gonna need q quality , is it ? it's <EOS>
yep . <EOS> no . <EOS> uh <EOS> well in fact could we could not we consider this button as a button supplement <EOS> because <EOS> oh no , <EOS> these are these are for colours , co and special forms , special colours and special materials . <EOS> so <EOS>
and the volume button will will become <EOS> it's up to you , means . <EOS> now that <EOS> well in fact b both will be could be useful , navigating through teletext . <EOS> means let's say this this can move the the larger digits and this can move the smaller digits . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> the microphone is a feature . <EOS> no , <EOS> aren't the features <EOS> the microphone's feature <EOS> and that you can change the channel's feature , <EOS> and that you can change the volume is feature , <EOS> and that you can change the options of the remote , uh uh something like that . yeah . <EOS>
the the ne next meeting is three twenty one yeah . <EOS> that's that's almost uh fifty minutes . <EOS> yeah that is . <EOS> uh they've they've changed the times from the presentations . <EOS> you guys can you guys you guys can uh create a all kinds of things . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> 'kay . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> oh , that's true . <EOS> good point . <EOS> in the sample ones that you showed us there was one that had the scroll buttons on the side , <EOS> which i think if we make it curved like a hand like a hand-shape like if we put the the scroll-button on the side , <EOS> that could be particularly useful . <EOS>
and i think you forgot a point here to have an button to find the charger , <EOS> because that's a major that's a <EOS> oh no <EOS> th actually th we'll come to that point in our <EOS> yeah <EOS> it's it's it's embed in the uh speech recognition system . <EOS>
because , i don't know if it's <EOS> i think it's e expensive , <EOS> if you have <EOS> if you use the telly screen , 'cause the telly's already a screen , then you can pro sort of have a programming function , really easy sort of arrow up and down , on the remote , <EOS> and then use the telly as a screen . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> i dunno if you can <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm . <EOS> it <EOS> i think it does . <EOS> i don't i don't think of a way you can operate a chip and convert that much data without without one . <EOS> but you could maybe have it in a little charging station like a mobile phone , or like a little cradle for your ipod . <EOS>
so we are targeting a segment which is which is just very trendy kind of thing , they they don't care about the buttons any more . <EOS> okay . <EOS> because have you thought about configuration and all this kind of uh stuff ? <EOS> and anyway <EOS> it's all automatic . <EOS>
the buttons should be large . <EOS> they shouldn't be tiny little things like you get on some mobile phones . <EOS> they should be easy to press , very comfortable . <EOS> um one of the examples given on the homepage was um there's an up and down volume button but both of them have a v_ on them , <EOS> so the up volume button looks like it should be a down volume button , that's kinda confusing . <EOS> um should avoid s things like that . <EOS> um if the the corporate colour scheme allows it we should have a very bright colour so that it can be easily identified anywhere . <EOS>
that's just a matter of tastes , <EOS> but <EOS> yeah , okay . <EOS> we have to use uh kind of flashy colours , i think . <EOS> uh can't we use um different uh fron uh fronts , with all with the the logo on it ? can we do that ? so <EOS>
sorry . <EOS> oh yeah . <EOS> well they drop off if you like move too much . <EOS> yeah <EOS> i dunno . but they're they're okay . <EOS> but i don't think we're supposed to be testing these microphones . <EOS> maybe we are . <EOS> i don't know . <EOS>
uh . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yep . <EOS> has <EOS> oh yeah , <EOS> do did have nah y <EOS> you have the black one . <EOS> and we'll probably make also a yellow one . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> but not r_ and r_ yellow i think . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> of course it's reachable . <EOS> it doesn't make <EOS> then we do it . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> okay , maybe just some light uh to to light it all up . <EOS> so you can see what's really there . <EOS> not just not re on the buttons or something . <EOS> just a green light or some blue light . <EOS>
that's no , i think it's the same one . <EOS> whatever name it popped up under . <EOS> uh functional , try functional , <EOS> it might not be it either , but we'll see . <EOS> functional . <EOS> it looks like it , <EOS> there's <EOS> yep , that's it . <EOS> so we'll go screen by screen . <EOS> although <EOS> since uh we need to have some type of idea on a market uh we had independent study that says it this this market has an availability to absorb eight mi eight million units per year . <EOS> okay ? <EOS> our internal company evaluation puts it between eight to nine million <EOS> which is approximately the same as the independent study . <EOS>
um and they can look after themselves . <EOS> next . <EOS> okay , yeah . i'll i'll <EOS> shall i rub that out , actually ? <EOS> i don't see as there's any need to . <EOS> there's plenty of space . <EOS> i mean whatever . <EOS> we can have have a whole menagerie . <EOS>
sign . <EOS> yep finished . <EOS> so i see you in thirty minutes . <EOS> great , okay . <EOS> thanks guys . <EOS> bye . <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay , thanks . <EOS> bye . <EOS> thank you . <EOS> uh . <EOS>
mm-hmm mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> but it's also like texting , <EOS> you don't <EOS> hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> and it's a very simple design , <EOS> there's not a lot to wrong , <EOS> the components are cheap to make . <EOS> it's also in terms of um being lost it's it's quite it looks quite different . <EOS> you know , <EOS> i i d i have several four remotes , <EOS> and they all look the same until you get up close <EOS> and you have to <EOS> you know , <EOS> this is really identifiable . <EOS>
two of the button , <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> but you don't have <EOS> i think it's a good idea , yeah . <EOS> yeah so you can just have uh just have this curve , <EOS> yeah , <EOS> and you move uh your hand here to press the buttons and then you move uh on the other side . <EOS> so you can have it on on two sides <EOS> and it'll be cool , <EOS> no ? <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> real hard rubber , or soft rubber . or something something between that . <EOS> yeah <EOS> think uh <EOS> also in between . <EOS> soft rubber . <EOS> yeah soft rubber <EOS> which you can you can feel in it . <EOS> yeah i know what you um . <EOS>
yeah , <EOS> because it shou <EOS> no <EOS> yeah . <EOS> to make some designs , <EOS> it is very easy . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> it is it is <EOS> yeah , <EOS> it is easy for to design something and then load it in your computer . <EOS>
okay <EOS> . mm-hmm , <EOS> and what is this here ? <EOS> oh right okay . <EOS> cool . <EOS> that's a number pad . <EOS> okay so the number pad is <EOS> 'kay , great . <EOS> where are we gonna have the slogan ? <EOS> um they're al along this <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
so maybe we'll just focus on the google controller plus the fancy controller , <EOS> maybe try to mix them these two concepts together , just in one and do a remote control with solar energy and batteries and with lev low level chips and wood . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> it's good . <EOS>
yeah <EOS> it's f kind of fun , <EOS> it was <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i think it was pretty clever <EOS> 'cause we were never able to get too far off track <EOS> because the information came in at the right time <EOS> and kind of filled in the gaps enough . <EOS> at the same time you had enough room to kind of just make things up , <EOS> which was kind of fun . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> ah it is . <EOS> it is definitely po <EOS> but , on the other hand on the other hand , uh if you have a remote and buy a new t_v_ that isn't incorporated in the remote <EOS> we have five minutes to go . <EOS>
oh yeah look at that . <EOS> mm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> as you also notice it's quite a boring design . <EOS> um . another remote control , slightly different , <EOS> it's a simpler remote control uh many less buttons but uh has many fewer functions , <EOS> um m much easier for the user to manipulate and use . <EOS> um it also has a bit of a cheap look <EOS> and it's also quite boring . <EOS>
yes , maybe we should phone him . <EOS> it's really w well designed . <EOS> um well mm . <EOS> um , when he is not here <EOS> we will just we just have to continue . <EOS> um so <EOS> just for record i i will take uh notes again . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> mm 'kay . <EOS> could have things like backlighting the buttons and stuff like that . <EOS> okay so so backlighting , that would be good . <EOS> or even a clear case . <EOS> um you know a a glowing a a glowing yellow type case where the yellow is showable , <EOS> but in the dark it sort of , it's alive . <EOS> um in in a slight subtle way . <EOS>
we were go we were going with the late with the the r_s_i_ rubber , weren't we ? <EOS> yeah , <EOS> so we want it rub rubber double curved . <EOS> the the <EOS> so it will look like something like this . <EOS> double ? <EOS> the double whopper , please . <EOS>
oh . <EOS> but i think the circle only does <EOS> channel isn't applicable to d_v_d_ really 'cause you don't wanna <EOS> but volume is and volume is actually controlled on the t_v_ so you don't have to switch . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah but it it would be <EOS> so but i'm saying like , does it make sense to have like some kind of a button , <EOS> so like you're if you're on t_v_ , like you can switch channels , <EOS> but then if uh if you're on d_v_d_ then like the channel bu like the the region of the disc that was for channels is for like switching to different tracks <EOS> or s you know , to different <EOS> i mean do we need to think about that , <EOS> that like <EOS>
i'm not sure exactly how it's gonna work , 'cause do you programme do we program the responses and the questions . <EOS> so does that mean that the user then has to ask the specific question , and can't change it in order for it to be recognised , <EOS> or can it be altered in a certain way , <EOS> or does the actually user program it , to say a channel means this . <EOS>
different , i think , also . <EOS> yeah ? <EOS> blue . <EOS> blue or red . <EOS> whatever you want it , i think . <EOS> uh depends on the colour of the <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> but you can't choo you can't choose it when you buy it . <EOS> you have to choose <EOS>
oh wow . well done . <EOS> well that's excellent . <EOS> go heather pauls . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> alright , now with that over and done with , our next step is to see if we are under budget . and um my computer's frozen . <EOS> and now it's not . <EOS> okay . so <EOS> um in our shared folder , <EOS> if everyone could go there right now , um <EOS>
i have a question . <EOS> uh-huh . <EOS> do you think radio waves um will interfere with other appliances in the home ? <EOS> uh , i don't think so , <EOS> because uh we can make uh we ca we can make this wave in a specific frequency . <EOS> so they can be in a range which is not inter interfering with the with other devices inside the home . <EOS>
yeah , but uh we can think that in a few years there will be t_v_ set that can access the internet . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , okay . <EOS> so it's a good idea if i i if we i if if we uh think about how to to to build up our remote uh control w with this functionality in a w which will c which will come in a few years . <EOS> so if we already have it in our remote control <EOS>
thinking of like syntactic case and thi <EOS> um oh when we move on , you two are going to be playing with play-dough . <EOS> um , and working on the look and feel of the design and user interface design . <EOS> and you're gonna be doing protu product evaluation . <EOS> so you'll get mm m more instructions from your personal coach . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> so for example uh well uh <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> .. . <EOS> okay , it works . fine . <EOS> so , <EOS> for example you have uh presently uh keys like one , two , mael can you hand me over this uh ? <EOS> yes . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> uh we get ins each of us will get instructions <EOS> and we'll take it from there . <EOS> project plan , that falls under the same heading pretty much . <EOS> um , i don't think we have any great discussion at this point . <EOS> um . <EOS>
ye <EOS> i don't think l_c_d_ is not necessary well , th for long term . <EOS> for universal remotes <EOS> if you mm . <EOS> i think thi this could be this could be a market <EOS> because uh universal remote controls uh tend to be uh quite expensive . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> so well <EOS> do you wanna go through and put through those on the the two products now <EOS> or do we wanna discuss them further <EOS> and then evaluate them ? <EOS> um , n no <EOS> why not why not discuss uh discuss it now , <EOS>
uh-huh . <EOS> there's a good man . there's a good idea . <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay um , i guess , since you're the marketing guy . <EOS> yeah , sure . i will be happy to do that . <EOS> we'll uh <EOS> okay , we could do that . um . <EOS>
but <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> okay <EOS> and you mean to the <EOS> and the lower distance . <EOS> oh f perfect . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> so the findings are too many cluttered buttons . <EOS> repetition of certain but buttons which i already explained , <EOS> example the volume and channel control buttons . <EOS> all are confusing and in inconsistent . <EOS> okay we had a latest finding of voice recognition , <EOS> there was a mail which mentions that our division has developed a new speech recognition s feature . <EOS> we have to check into the for financial f feasibility whether we can incorporate it this at a low cost , <EOS> but for <EOS> like we had g um s response from the customers that they would like to have the feature of finding it . <EOS> so it could be like , where is the remote , and the remote answers i am here . <EOS> some kind of thing or it gives a b bleep sound or some kind of sound <EOS> and if this can be incorporated this would be more uh you can say trendy also ? <EOS> and technologically innovative also . <EOS>
previous page , yeah , indeed . <EOS> oh my god . <EOS> uh battery indicator . <EOS> it's it's a bit big . <EOS> and this is the uh the on off uh knop , the stand by uh knop . <EOS> it's quite large . <EOS> or at least it should look like it . <EOS> and the options uh of teletext . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> that's fine . <EOS> okay so <EOS> mm it's enough . but uh click it on off ? <EOS> so you all know me , <EOS> i'm the industrial designer . <EOS> and we've some basic components that um our remote is gonna need , <EOS> just basically every remote'll need 'em . <EOS> we need some kinda of power d power source . <EOS> um we have to decide on our our user interface , which is his department , <EOS> but the in user interface is also a major component . <EOS> um we need a programmable digital signal processor to um to take the input from the user and translate that into uh
well we need to think about how it's gonna look different . <EOS> i think that's that sounds a really attractive idea , <EOS> i've not come across anything like that before , <EOS> if it kind of <EOS> yeah <EOS> and that opens out into your flip-top . <EOS> then it's nice t to h <EOS> you can make it lightweight plastic , <EOS> nice to hold in the palm of the hand <EOS> and just because you're having to actually insert in between the two covers , that's gonna take care of some of the repetitive strain injury trying p prevent a lot of that i would think . <EOS> i think it's a really nice idea <EOS> and plus you can get <EOS> you know even though we're using plastic , you can still i mean think of the designs you can get in plastic , <EOS> we can do a nice conch shell or scallop shell exterior . <EOS>
sort of give an idea . <EOS> i have no idea how one would explain this . <EOS> mm maybe with some whiskers . <EOS> briefly , it's supposed to be a seal . <EOS> you can imagine it in the water . <EOS> i like them , <EOS> because they are like playful and silly sort of <EOS> have a good time . <EOS> not gonna try and pretend like i can get any better than that . <EOS>
oh , it's a <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , audi audio settings and screen settings , we need those <EOS> like audio settings mono , stereo , pitch , screen settings like brightness , colour , <EOS> or do we just want that accessed accessed from the television itself ? <EOS>
okay . right . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> most of the stuff is pretty cheap though bought in bulk . <EOS> so i don't think it's that much of a problem . <EOS> like the chip is probably the most expensive part . <EOS> what does chip on print mean ? <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> so th it's something eatable . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> but anyway this is not a mushroom anyway , so it's fine . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i i think we take into account what you said about fruit and vegetable you know . <EOS> this , you know , very enlighted colours , you know . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> uh uh <EOS> i think they're they're about the same cost really . <EOS> i i mean , <EOS> i think it's just sort of the the <EOS> there's a lot of slide buttons out there . <EOS> i think it's pretty much the same sort of connection . mm yeah . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> there is also um a speech recognition to store channel information , names , <EOS> like <EOS> you can basically <EOS> if you have a multiple functionality , say t_v_ , v_c_r_ or something i say it to the t_v_ and the t_v_ , and you can programme the keys if you want to , certain keys are even the channel information . <EOS>
yes , <EOS> okay so we tested a hundred subjects in our lab , <EOS> and we just we watched them and we also made them fill out a questionnaire , <EOS> and we found that the users are not typically happy with current remote controls . <EOS> seventy five percent think they're ugly . <EOS> eighty percent want they've are willing to spend more , which is good news for us um if we make it look fancier , <EOS> and basically w we just need something that really <EOS> i mean there's some other points up there , <EOS> but they it needs to be snazzy and it but yet simple . <EOS> so that's really what we need to do . <EOS> and we need we need it to be simple , yet it needs to be high-tech looking . so <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> good choice , mister david jordan . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , i mean you're famous . you . <EOS> and but i'd <EOS> and also you can , if you i <EOS> yeah , what's what's this cherry ? <EOS> you ca you can turn this . <EOS> or you ca you can you can also turn this . <EOS> for this you can tune it's for tune . <EOS> you you if you want to skip from channel one to channel two , you you skip this . <EOS> if you want to from uh skip from channel one to channel ten you tune this . <EOS> it's like fine , from coarse to fine . <EOS> this is coarse , this is fine . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> the first question . <EOS> of the questions . <EOS> so you know that um <EOS> for the younger it's very important <EOS> to have l_c_d_ and voice . <EOS> to have the <EOS> s yes <EOS> and speech recognition . <EOS> and uh and the others is not so important <EOS> but uh we know that uh uh people between fifteen and twenty five are people who watch a lot t_v_ and uh who who wh can use a lot this uh . <EOS> so maybe we we can have a speech recognition in . <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
like a disc . <EOS> yeah . yeah . it's like it's just like the same technology as a mouse pad . <EOS> i've never used one . no . <EOS> it's like l this like that , and then you do that . <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
i think it yeah , you you will do an <EOS> should i do it again ? <EOS> maybe . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> this time it should come up both . <EOS> right then . <EOS> i don't actually have a huge amount of different information then what kate says , <EOS>
yeah yeah yeah , <EOS> i mean yeah . <EOS> so you guys can decide wh whether <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . yeah . <EOS> oops . <EOS> i th i think the alternative is flipping from the top . <EOS> yeah well yeah , <EOS> but it's it's a bit long . <EOS> it's a little bit long . <EOS> well , i mean it can be opened like this of course and yeah . <EOS>
but <EOS> exactly . <EOS> um the kinetic energy thing um might work , um but the same problem . <EOS> you leave it lying around and you first have to shake it before it it starts to work . <EOS> so i'd say what we're stuck with really is um the basic battery . <EOS>
so what exactly we are looking at , is this like the front of the remote ? <EOS> this is just like a rough schematic . <EOS> so this is the internal workings . <EOS> so this would be the front ? <EOS> so the red would be the front of the remote though , right ? <EOS> okay . <EOS>
yeah , <EOS> but isn't it per remote that you pay ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i then i think i p i don i don't think they me mean they're special <EOS> oh right , yeah . <EOS> is it per remote ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> half ? <EOS> i think you pay half per remote . <EOS> so each remote with a special colour . <EOS>
yeah , <EOS> if you have , for example <EOS> i think that the volume and the buttons that are there on the top are not very easy to reach with your thumb . <EOS> it could be on the right side , for example . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> because we don't have these input buttons and this other stuff that they have . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> all these points uh we have to look at . <EOS> you all know them . <EOS> but uh there's another point . <EOS> the um uh the main uh people of interest of this company are forty plus people . <EOS> so they're old and not younger people . <EOS> so we have to look at that as well . <EOS> 'specially old people , maybe bi bigger buttons or something , <EOS> i dunno . <EOS>
it's kinda takes the place of having a button to press for the date and having the button to press for the channel , things like that . <EOS> um it could be it c <EOS> uh-huh . <EOS> right . <EOS> right , so it's kind of doing away with the programming feature ? <EOS> right . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> but you should be careful , <EOS> people are sometime becoming problem , <EOS> like a guy has recently designed a remote <EOS> uh uh uh which could switch off any other t_v_s , so basically through all the things . <EOS> so maybe we should think of <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> and the voice recognition . <EOS> they're gonna be our two selling points . <EOS> okay , <EOS> now uh having said that <EOS> i'm supposed to make a little presentation , aren't i ? <EOS> no , now this was our evaluation criteria which we uh just have done . <EOS> now we're gonna talk about financing . <EOS>
a sea shell ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah we could look in at that . <EOS> or you could do um different , like you get with mobile phones , different fascias . <EOS> you could have different kind of casings . <EOS> so you could have like psychedelic ones for younger people and sleek ones and <EOS>
how do you mean ? <EOS> uh sixteen to forty . <EOS> well i i guess people of sixteen are are quite used to technology . <EOS> so they they adapt to it pretty soon i guess . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> we we have to <EOS> yeah . <EOS> and if we have a larger public we have uh yeah more options to to uh sell our product . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> well but d_v_d_ is only like four buttons . <EOS> yeah , it is only fun <EOS> yeah , <EOS> but i mean like to switch the fun so like to switch the function of the little circle disc , the touch pad . <EOS> but i <EOS>
oh , i'll go for a one . <EOS> basic requirements but of the pro of the project . <EOS> yeah th <EOS> mm <EOS> yellow . <EOS> uh-huh . <EOS> come on that was the tha <EOS> 'kay . <EOS> uh-huh . <EOS> okay . <EOS> being fruitist . <EOS>
uh i it has different blocks , different blocks . <EOS> uh first is remote control have sh ha should have some electric circuits uh making interface with uh keyboard and uh r reading uh keyboard and reading the keyboard uh commands . <EOS> and then inter then make uh these keyboard commands , <EOS> uh in interpret these int uh keyboard commands . <EOS> and then there should be uh an electronic circuit making uh electronic signals according to these commands <EOS> and uh finally there is a transmitter which is a cord or a a diode making uh making uh waves to transmit through the air <EOS> and uh uh this air this uh wave uh will be received by the by the other device like a television or whatever , to uh r to realise the command . <EOS> okay , uh about what i found about uh different uh these different blocks are uh , usually there are two different methods uh to for designing a remote control . <EOS> they are based on infra-red uh waves or uh uh radio waves . <EOS> there are two different uh uh solutions i mean . <EOS> this is uh this can be uh uh the the differences the th between different kind of waves , infra-red or radio waves . <EOS>
yeah , <EOS> you can make it curved or mm round . <EOS> but just in two d_ , not in depth . <EOS> more rounded . <EOS> yeah . yeah . <EOS> yeah , that's right . <EOS> okay . <EOS> so <EOS> we have to decide which one we're going to choose from these . what exactly . <EOS> because we have to know it . <EOS> so the energy uh is the recharger . <EOS> we already know that . <EOS> just a normal battery . <EOS> okay . <EOS> the chip-on-print is a normal one . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> i personally would look at things like having a u universal remote , <EOS> is uh um is a good idea , <EOS> like <EOS> instead of having unusual ones for all of them you can think of having , um with multiple functionality possibly with speech recognition . <EOS> i got a mail from the the coffee machine interface unit <EOS> that uh they have uh integrated the s speech recognition into a into the coffee machine , <EOS> and so if you say hello coffee machine , it say hi joe , or something like that , <EOS> you know , and uh <EOS>
yeah , yeah . mm . <EOS> okay . <EOS> but for instance th i i'm thinking about the other uh uh particularity that the the remote control could have . <EOS> s since it it knows who is using it , <EOS> it might also record the kind of uh channels you are u more often using and uh levels of volumes that you're more often uh things like that <EOS> and provide you ways of using them , i dunno , somehow , <EOS> i dunno , <EOS> that might be expensive <EOS> but <EOS>
yes . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> um . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yes that seems right . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay , yeah . <EOS> and if dur between the time of this meeting finishing and the next meeting starting , if you get any additional information that uh only you have at that point in time you'd think would be relevant to other people in terms of their des decision making um process , then we should communicate that as quickly as possible and not wait until the next meeting . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> well , that's why i don't like uh macs or apples , <EOS> just 'cause i look at it , and i know it's probably a very good computer , <EOS> but i look at it , and i'm taken back to elementary school , 'cause they look the same . <EOS> they look like they did when i was in elementary school , <EOS> and that's so old-fashioned to me . <EOS>
uh . we maybe you can have a speech uh recognition interface . <EOS> you just tell the television i want which channel . <EOS> or or you can say for example , um i want uh to list all the programme tonight . <EOS> you won't <EOS> y you know , instead of uh remote control it's doing the some searching for you , <EOS> so you don't have to look for the channel you want . <EOS> just say maybe i just want to press i wanna have a button for all the movies tonight . <EOS> or a button for all the magazines , all the information documentary tonight . <EOS> and then you list a few , <EOS> and i will choose from the list . <EOS> so instead of pressing the channel number , i am choosing the programmes directly . <EOS> yeah , that's one way of uh making it useful . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> 'kay . <EOS> another thing is you have to be uh a bit slow . <EOS> 'cause if you're going to draw like really fast then um the pen won't hold up . <EOS> so <EOS> we choose form of current colour <EOS> uh i think grey is appropriate . <EOS> then the line width . <EOS> i think seven will be nice . <EOS> now you'll see my drawing capabilities . <EOS> these are not very much , <EOS> but uh <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> why can't i work here ? this is much easier . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> much easier , yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> the middle has to be very small so you can have it in your hand . <EOS> mm . <EOS> i don't see a sign that the meeting is over yet but <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i think it's a good design and it's innovative as well then . <EOS> maybe we can keep the banana . <EOS> and it will be very easy to find . <EOS> you can put also vibrator inside . <EOS> and everybody knows what is a banana . <EOS> basically . <EOS> if you if you start with uh fancy fruits and fra s and tha <EOS>
so we really have a incentive to make this remote work . <EOS> yeah . yeah . <EOS> i'd like to share in the coffee machine profits , because that's really doing well . <EOS> i want a share in the space rocket . <EOS> did you see that this k that this company we've made a spaceship . <EOS>
but is it <EOS> yeah , the shape is unique , <EOS> and the colour <EOS> uh i'll agree it's unique , <EOS> but is it really <EOS> is it really fancy ? <EOS> so it depend on how d do you define fancy . <EOS> yeah i mean , fancy was was defined by s fruit and vegetable look . <EOS>
well i i i think uh it's the <EOS> it's not a good place maybe . <EOS> yeah but <EOS> no i i it's the all around camer uh microphone isn't it . <EOS> the the microphone picks up the speeches from anywhere . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> is it an only a single mic or a microphone array ? <EOS>
oh , <EOS> that would definitely be my second choice . <EOS> mm . <EOS> although the tog toggle <EOS> i'm afraid i would <EOS> that's cool . <EOS> let's all let's all go for the yellow <EOS> i would break it . i would break it . <EOS> it's cool . <EOS> i think i would break it . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> um i i'm not saying there's no need for an l_c_d_ display , <EOS> but um it's what's what what would it tell the user , <EOS> 'cause the l_c_d_ tends to be an output as uh as opposed to an input so um does the remote control need to talk back to the user ? <EOS> we have the option of the speaker as well <EOS> the sa the same thing goes for the speaker , is there a need for the remote control to to talk back ? <EOS>
that's some spots . <EOS> i in the file option menu . <EOS> okay , <EOS> then m make a new one . <EOS> no . <EOS> how much time do we have to draw anyway ? <EOS> 'cause i can take forever on this . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> do i have to explain uh why i chose this uh this animal ? <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> you have to go back . <EOS> yeah uh uh . <EOS> isn't it better to have the sound and the general buttons horizontal ? <EOS> i don't know . <EOS> i think it's <EOS> with the minus and the plus . <EOS> i think it's easier than <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> so <EOS> for the financial aspect it's okay , <EOS> we can uh we can continue with this product uh as if , <EOS> and we are now going to see the project evaluation with uh our marketing expert . yeah . okay . <EOS> so uh <EOS> you can have my project in <EOS>
yes . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> we'll just run through it yeah , yeah , um . <EOS> you discussed either a lithium or a solar power . <EOS> would the solar power be enough to fuel a voice recognition ? <EOS> or this kinesthetic one , would that be enough to fuel a voice recognition remote control ? <EOS>
and why not wood ? <EOS> and why not wood ? <EOS> and , <EOS> hmm ? <EOS> uh , well we can use wood . <EOS> i don't know why we'd want to . <EOS> um and also we should note that if we want an ipod-style wheel button , it's gonna require a m qu slightly more expensive chip . <EOS> we can't use the minimal chip , we need the next higher grade , which is called regular . <EOS> i don't think it's much more expensive , but it is more expensive . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> uh . <EOS> by watching t_v_ ? <EOS> yay . <EOS> fantastic . <EOS> okay , brilliant . <EOS> thank you very much . <EOS> alright ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay , bye . <EOS> mm . <EOS> conclusion ? dadada . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> maybe f yeah . <EOS> yeah , that's g that's a good idea . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> the idea <EOS> it didn't have to necessarily be f a hinge , <EOS> that was just one idea though . <EOS> that's that's interesting of course , <EOS> but that's of course a weak point , yeah . <EOS>
f f yeah f fairly basic , <EOS> you guys think ? <EOS> yeah one . <EOS> yep , that's fine . <EOS> yeah , one ? <EOS> okay . <EOS> um , soft and spongy , have we achieved that ? <EOS> we've used mostly plastic in the end so it's going to be quite a bit of a compromise for price . <EOS> five ? <EOS>
mm . <EOS> the menu system and the the fact that multiple buttons are used for different things might be a bit confusing , <EOS> but i think if it's one it's one of those things that it might take you five minutes to figure out , but you'll have it afterwards . <EOS> so i'd i think i'd give it a two i guess . <EOS>
see if we can cut some corners . <EOS> right . well <EOS> and we can look into this other manufacturing option , <EOS> and maybe we can get 'em somewhere else cheaper . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> it's true . <EOS> we could initially go with what we have <EOS> and if we can find them cheaper later on <EOS>
yeah , <EOS> i <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay <EOS> so so we keep all these all these buttons . <EOS> yeah yeah , at least nine , ten button . <EOS> maybe maybe we could think of something more betweens , like <EOS> uh <EOS> like ten plus , five plus , one plus , one minus or something . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> it i if it is gonna be somewhere that you put it down then it needs to be at the side of your armchair , <EOS> and that implies that there's only one t_v_ user . <EOS> so it's very good for some people <EOS> but it's not a like <EOS>
yes . <EOS> yeah <EOS> we have moose and we have deer . <EOS> you do . <EOS> we have moose too . <EOS> okay . <EOS> do you have <EOS> we have sheep . <EOS> sheep . yeah , <EOS> cows . <EOS> 'kay , um . <EOS> that's a great elk . <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
the little <EOS> ah-ha . <EOS> the the <EOS> oh that's good , <EOS> we can clip them on . <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah , there was this microphone as well that you <EOS> now <EOS> where do i put the <EOS> just um somewhere <EOS> yep , <EOS> the , it's just across there , <EOS> that's it . <EOS> yep . <EOS>
okay , so <EOS> in terms of not losing it , do you think that on a scale of one to seven , how easy or hard is it to lose ? <EOS> i'm gonna i'm gonna give it a four , <EOS> 'cause i think that you can still <EOS> if it's in between somewhere where you can't see it , you're kind of not gonna find it , <EOS> but anywhere else it's gonna stand out . <EOS>
no <EOS> it's fashion , yeah . <EOS> what about the touch scr touch screen ? for example . <EOS> it's it's expensive i i guess . <EOS> i think a touch screen will be t as expensive as the l_c_d_ buttons so . <EOS> but and it is a kind of other design , i mean . <EOS> it can also be interesting to have this kind of <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah , okay . <EOS> yeah , it's different . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , that's true , yeah . <EOS> yeah , yeah yeah , yeah , that's a good point . yep . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> age b below forty . <EOS> so that's that's probably uh a <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> sturdy , you know . for being strong and sturdy . <EOS> so um <EOS> if we want something strong and sturdy , i say stay with plastic or titanium , <EOS> but if we go with spongy , we can stress that you can drop this as many times as you want , <EOS> it doesn't matter , <EOS> it's spongy material , <EOS> it's not gonna break , <EOS> you know . <EOS> i just don't know how the l_e_d_ and the lights are gonna fit into a spongy material <EOS> because it's not gonna be completely squeezable . <EOS> so <EOS> how do things fit it ? <EOS>
um internet is also mentioned in a function we can use . <EOS> uh maybe also on televisions it will be available as well . <EOS> another one is uh the customer is uh forty plus . uh that's the the market we have to to to target , <EOS> because we are going to develop a new product which is specially designed for the younger customers . <EOS> um this is uh a bit pity for the marketing uh expert . <EOS> because he was uh aiming on the the younger persons . <EOS> so we have to find a market which is above forty plus <EOS> uh but which will suit our <EOS>
there's an idea . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> and again copying imac's kind of for ipod mac apple's uh colour scheme . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> get in there . <EOS> yeah , totally . <EOS> yeah , i think that's probably a good id <EOS> okay so <EOS> let's work on uh multiple case colours . <EOS> but yeah , <EOS> stick with the same kind of kinda yeah , the same basic non-remote kind of remote design . <EOS> cool . <EOS>
right . <EOS> mm 'kay . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> that's all i got . <EOS> 'kay , <EOS> thank you very much , <EOS> um i'll take that back . <EOS> ooh that's tight . <EOS> right , also so um a notice i got not very long before the meeting , <EOS> so didn't manage to forward it on to you , <EOS> it is <EOS> let's see , <EOS> i'll find it myself , um <EOS> ta <EOS> nah . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> and where we had a a few buttons and all . <EOS> and uh if you open the remote controller you have this circui circuit board and few electronic components , <EOS> like you can see a chip there which is having eighteen pins , <EOS> and also a capac uh a capacitor , three resistors and also a resonator <EOS> uh um mm yeah , <EOS> and di and a diode transistor . <EOS>
oh no , <EOS> too much concept . <EOS> ah . <EOS> no . <EOS> uh <EOS> yeah , <EOS> we will not use this . we will not use this . <EOS> but instead of this i will devise that's our concept . <EOS> ah , <EOS> back today . <EOS>
oh okay . <EOS> oh , what do we have to do now . <EOS> do we uh <EOS> i thought we were done at four o'clock ? <EOS> it's now quarter past three . so <EOS> yep . <EOS> i should take some pictures uh . <EOS> okay . <EOS>
nope . <EOS> that that's about it really . <EOS> just sit still i guess for a little while . <EOS> do we retreat to our , to continue our <EOS> i think we could probably do it here as long as we don't collaborate . <EOS> um <EOS> r reporting or what i <EOS>
uh , yeah . <EOS> this one ? <EOS> i think so , yeah . <EOS> yeah , that's the one . <EOS> so , it's a very short presentation , <EOS> 'cause i'm actually gonna draw you the layout on the board <EOS> so if you want to just go straight to the second slide , <EOS> um , which basically shows , sort of <EOS> i took the ideas that we were talking about last time um and tried to put that into the remote control so the things that y you can actually see on it are the on off switch , volume and channel control , the menu access button , ergonomic shape , <EOS> which i completely agree with christine's idea to have it sort of molded , so it's slightly more ergonomic and comfortable to hold than the r standard very straight remote controls . <EOS> and actually the other thing with the wood if we take your customising idea , is that people can actually do sort of quasi-measurements on their hand size , <EOS> so if someone has larger hands , you have a wider remote control . <EOS>
work for that ? <EOS> is there a standard colour ? <EOS> and a standard , <EOS> yeah <EOS> we don't <EOS> no <EOS> we have different colour . <EOS> how many colours are we going to <EOS> i i <EOS> you got you got different colours , <EOS> but you should have a standard colour . <EOS>
'kay um <EOS> ah . <EOS> is it rude ? <EOS> it's an elephant . <EOS> that's a very good elephant . <EOS> the back end of an elephant . <EOS> oh my gosh , <EOS> i'm never gonna be able to draw that well . <EOS> 'kay , and you want to write up on there , <EOS> it says you've gotta sum up your f f your favourite characteristics of that animal . <EOS>
can't we make uh can't we make a remote which you can flip over and use on the same <EOS> um <EOS> functions as the normal one ? <EOS> you mean um <EOS> then you have to <EOS> yeah <EOS> if <EOS> let's see if i ca <EOS> a blank one . <EOS> and then you get <EOS> here's a little l_c_d_ screen . <EOS> uh now i have to think . <EOS> it's a plus and a min . <EOS> no it's not very handy i think . <EOS> because the plus and the min will be opposite <EOS> and all kinds of <EOS>
um poo , <EOS> this is a lot of text . <EOS> i wasn't able to organise this yet . <EOS> we have yeah several uh interface designs . <EOS> uh we can use a scroll buttons for the menus , <EOS> but we already kind of decided to go for the f for the pushbuttons , for the the arrow buttons . <EOS> so that's not really interesting . <EOS>
wow . <EOS> just about . <EOS> it's a inspired design . <EOS> sh do you want me to hold it ? <EOS> uh there we go , <EOS> just screw 'em on in . <EOS> gonna have to swap them round so <EOS> now , it was function f_ eight . <EOS>
poor elephant . <EOS> and sometimes they have a hump . <EOS> it seems that uh elephants are pretty friendly <EOS> and they they have one very important way a different way of walking . <EOS> so when they walk , wherever they are going to put their first feet , the second feet will always be . <EOS> when they'll come to that position the second , the third feet will be there . <EOS> that's the way they walk . <EOS> and that's very peculiar about them . <EOS> none of the other animals walk like this . <EOS> and they are very useful to human beings . <EOS> at least few few hundred years ago when there was no means of transportations or something , or when they had to carry huge um loads from one place to another , elephants were very useful . <EOS> and they are found in um usually the warm countries . <EOS> and um they are the biggest terrestrial animal . <EOS> that's what i know about them . <EOS> so , that's what i wanted to tell about elephants . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> oh , <EOS> that's definitely a very important factor , especially to users who are gonna be buying the thing and then using it almost on an daily basis in a lot of cases , i think . <EOS> first . <EOS> yep . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> okay , <EOS> so i don't have any questions . <EOS> sounds good . <EOS>
so which vegetable ? <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah , i know , carrot . <EOS> the the lemon . <EOS> well what are the options ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> but we don't want it to be <EOS> yeah . <EOS> um the child-friendly , yeah . <EOS> easy to use , it seems quite easy to use . <EOS> i like the d the different shapes of the buttons and stuff . <EOS> i think that's a good idea to go for . <EOS>
the fashion trends we got from talking to our our contacts in the fashion industry based in paris and milan . <EOS> um <EOS> so f from our market research basically we've come to the conclusion that a fancy look and feel , um as opposed to a functional look and feel , is our number one priority . <EOS> um fancy is is is is the , you know , highest priority . <EOS> secondly um that our remote control needs to be techn technologically innovative . <EOS> um so this is t number two priority but it's two times less important as the fancy criteria . <EOS> um and third thirdly the easiness of use is is the um is is important as well , <EOS> but again two times less important as the technologically innovativeness of the remote control . <EOS>
mm . and what about the price of this component ? <EOS> so <EOS> uh maybe we can make uh it in five euros and even less than that , <EOS> because we want to have uh millions and in bulk , <EOS> so we can make really simp <EOS> and we want to make really simple device <EOS> because we have only very few words like like power , switch on or some like <EOS> then we'll have something like this um <EOS>
no ? <EOS> you received something <EOS> yeah . <EOS> you we uh an email from the manufacturing division that they have basically a voice recognition chip already developed . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> says <EOS> yeah . <EOS> it says that ri right now they just use it to uh to record uh answers to particular questions . <EOS> but i guess it could be <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> and whether we'd have a big enough market to have this kind of like secondary market of selling the cases might be something to consider . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> well if it's for young people , um like the phone generation , that sort of thing'd probably go down well , <EOS> and the market research has been on that side of things , hasn't it ? <EOS>
no . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> your fingers , yeah . <EOS> you don't want uh <EOS> because if you lose the pen uh if you lose the pen uh you can't use <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> y you could include a pen . <EOS> use a pen you you c <EOS> you can lose the pen . <EOS>
in in in in my interpretation of management's instructions uh is that yes it it meets the requirement <EOS> is t it's television only , <EOS> it's it's simple to use , <EOS> um it's it's it's within budget , <EOS> um i it's uh yes an an any minor points we we we argue . <EOS>
so we'll have to figure it how to cover all the different variances in signals . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> and what we need an insanely good instruction booklet , <EOS> because you always have to reconfigure all your contraptions to go with the remote anyways . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> 'kay , <EOS> and um another thing that i think is important is the d the design of the product , how it feels in your hand . <EOS> if it's just flat and kind of boring th those don't nobody wants to buy those any more . <EOS> they want the ergonomic ones . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> ones that ones that look high-tech , too . <EOS>
no . <EOS> okay . <EOS> when we threw it open to the field yeah . <EOS> so <EOS> but it's something to put on the side to think about maybe . <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay , right . <EOS> okay , <EOS> well i'll move on . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS>
fashion . <EOS> real reaction , and such . <EOS> so um <EOS> the slogan is <EOS> yeah , <EOS> the slogan's we put the fashion in electronics , <EOS> isn't it ? <EOS> oh , sorry . <EOS> my apologies . <EOS> no <EOS> it could well be , <EOS> i've probably missed that . <EOS> um , i think that's l almost the last minute thing <EOS> we can just incorporate into the actual plastic on top . <EOS> so i'm not too concerned a that we haven't gone into depth about that . <EOS> but it might be something you could consider when you're thinking about shapes ? <EOS>
needs to be k uh wrapped up fairly quickly . <EOS> so uh um <EOS> we've got thirty minutes to start looking at the um at the design in more detail . <EOS> um then we'll we will reconvene in in thirty minutes <EOS> and try to get some of these ideas uh uh more formalised . <EOS> uh thank you very much indeed . <EOS>
alt function f_ eight . <EOS> again not doing anything . <EOS> there's usually a little thing in the top right for the <EOS> oh hang on , <EOS> it's just coming on . <EOS> oh . <EOS> ah there , <EOS> it's doing something . <EOS> pressed about five times now . <EOS>
word . <EOS> 'cause i've seen i've seen this used on computers before , <EOS> where you just you address the remote , <EOS> you address the computer , <EOS> and then give it a command . <EOS> you cer certainly could . <EOS> mm . <EOS> depe uh i depends whether um <EOS> if we want to make this so simple that anybody can walk into the room and lift it up and say <EOS>
um , i dunno , <EOS> i've never bought a remote control , <EOS> so i don't know how how good a remote control that would get you . um . <EOS> no . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> yeah . <EOS> but yeah , i suppose it has to look kind of cool and gimmicky . <EOS>
no . <EOS> four . <EOS> we can put four ? <EOS> everyone is okay <EOS> or four poin <EOS> yeah . <EOS> for twenty five . <EOS> yeah , four . four , yeah , let's put four . <EOS> four . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> doesn't it <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> so for each of these we need to give it a one to seven . <EOS> is that right ? <EOS> yes , <EOS> i did have a_ , b_ , c_ , and d_ down here , <EOS> but it seems to have turned into like just bullet points . <EOS> okay . but if you can imagine that they say a_ , b_ , c_ , and d_ , then that would be really good . <EOS>
is that okay for you ? yeah . <EOS> mm mm mm mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so <EOS> given we are going for this uh uh universal type <EOS> uh m maybe it is good when you try to find out which components you therefore need <EOS> and y you will try to get more specific uh user interface content <EOS> and uh maybe you can look on on what trends are in this uh in this type of market . <EOS>
yeah yeah . no but my screen is reduced in size . <EOS> yeah . that's difficult . yeah . <EOS> what ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> feedback . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> alt delete . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> format . <EOS> format save . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> yeah . so , that's that . <EOS> so that's the evaluation , <EOS> so i'd say yay . <EOS> we've , we've done well . <EOS> alright it's all all systems go . <EOS> it's like like a number one . um . <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
sorry i didn't get the last part , you're talking of <EOS> display . <EOS> uh what what <EOS> just what you said i i didn't get the uh meaning of it completely , you're saying like <EOS> oh on the on the l_c_d_ screen you could becau you could fit it <EOS> the problem with it basically is that it's flat and so you can't do lots of curve curved things with it , <EOS> but um you can <EOS> you wouldn't have <EOS> with the l_c_d_ you'd have the wires coming off , <EOS> you wouldn't have that with the <EOS>
yeah maybe not co confining . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm , mm-hmm . <EOS> okay . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm , mm-hmm . <EOS> uh-huh . <EOS> mm-hmm , mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> okay . <EOS> mm . <EOS> mm-hmm , mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
wait . <EOS> red and yellow . <EOS> we could turn we could turn everything in either yellow or black . <EOS> black then is a regular colour , so . <EOS> we we can we can we c <EOS> yellow . <EOS> i think so we need if we try to have a kind of <EOS>
simplicity . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah <EOS> g <EOS> available . <EOS> but the people have a new television , <EOS> and c if you look into the future , then they want will want the button , if their thing is broke . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> so you're talking there about uh changing changing the casing . <EOS> that's possibly it . <EOS> yeah <EOS> the a the actual the sort of the look from the outside , <EOS> so where the buttons would stay the same , <EOS> and the general function of the remote would stay the same , <EOS> but you could change the the way it looked . <EOS>
well <EOS> you still do . <EOS> you s you still <EOS> w <EOS> yeah . <EOS> you put it on t on the couch table . <EOS> while you're watching , <EOS> it's gonna roll off . <EOS> so <EOS> that's not an issue really . <EOS> rolls away <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah , th that kind of stuff , <EOS> but maybe um if you log in first as a parent um , you address the the channels <EOS> and like uh oh , that's channel fifteen , <EOS> that's uh <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yes . <EOS> vi violent channel , <EOS> uh m my ki my kids uh <EOS> i don't want my kids to watch that , <EOS> then you set the priority to only parents , <EOS>
h it's got higher centre of gravity like that . <EOS> 'kay we're done designing . <EOS> come on . <EOS> three . <EOS> you would though , 'cause it's bit it's more interesting than other remotes . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i think , it was another colour and it was like i think it'd look okay . <EOS> i think maybe a two . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> yeah <EOS> it's <EOS> uh well <EOS> you you can follow the ideas how you want to keep the keys , <EOS> you know <EOS> right now if you take it you have like zero , one , two , three like a keys separately , <EOS> but suppose if you take the the present trend of mobile phones there are like big thick keys <EOS> you press on the top , it takes one number , <EOS> you press on the bottom it takes another number , <EOS> and uh basically uh uh <EOS> so the space covered <EOS> so that you don't see two separate keys there actually <EOS> so it it is like uh um i i it is like uh <EOS>
we already have some . <EOS> so you have to anticipate the the future ? <EOS> yeah . yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> the future demand , market demand . <EOS> yeah , that's right . <EOS> yeah , to desi <EOS> well , not not to implement it , <EOS> but to well , to find a way to to add to add this functionality in a yeah , in an in an easy manner , if is possible . <EOS>
mm' kay . <EOS> so yellow for the body , <EOS> and then what colour for the buttons ? <EOS> um . <EOS> um i quite like the multi-coloured buttons myself . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so multi-coloured buttons . <EOS> you do have ones like um play could be green or on and off is red , and stuff like that , yeah . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah it the marketing will have a lot to do with it . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> and the kinetic energy , shaker-style-y , whoo , <EOS> ooh no . <EOS> and the kinetic energy part . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> don't shake <EOS>
so it's not this one . <EOS> uh yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay . so i am going to talk about a little bit about how this remote control should be appear to be more easy to use . <EOS> i think uh i think the feature easy to use is more important than being fancy , <EOS> but okay , we can discuss about it uh later . <EOS>
warning , finish meeting now . <EOS> guys , i think we have to finish the meeting . <EOS> okay . <EOS> 'kay this is a hard one . <EOS> uh ? <EOS> boom-boa-ring-bing . <EOS> what does it say ? <EOS> fill in the questionnaire . <EOS> what now ? <EOS>
three . <EOS> um . <EOS> no it's <EOS> think it's the last one . <EOS> probably . technical pa i would think . <EOS> no , <EOS> then this is <EOS> the la yeah , that one , final design . <EOS> it is named appropriately , you just couldn't see the name . <EOS> um okay , can i have the mouse ? <EOS>
oh right . okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> um , there we go . <EOS> and back to our powerpoint . <EOS> so we've <EOS> 'kay . <EOS> yes we are . <EOS> so we need to do a product evaluation , again , <EOS> which is probably um <EOS>
yeah , <EOS> but it was because we didn't uh <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah yeah yeah , <EOS> but furthermore better . <EOS> okay , <EOS> and maybe i should walk out of the room when you discuss uh this point , <EOS> the leadership . <EOS> that's <EOS> yeah , no prob . ah . <EOS>
yeah , <EOS> i uh i dunno . <EOS> a more <EOS> yeah . <EOS> it it could be like a nokia , like plastic . <EOS> that's better prob <EOS> yeah . <EOS> uh uh <EOS> yeah , <EOS> just uh <EOS> with the hard hard buttons . <EOS> i think uh rubber really has an odd look . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> so . but <EOS> they think that or do their doctor the doctor says ? <EOS> but it's it's the opinion of the uh of the users huh ? <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah . that's what the report says yeah . <EOS> um and then it's got a demographic breakdown <EOS> on <EOS>
thanks guys . <EOS> cool . <EOS> thank you . <EOS> alright . <EOS>
um . <EOS> maybe not even all of it <EOS> 'cause we said um colours and fashion w were important <EOS> so maybe um just like a little l line that's kind of around the outside and then you can make the rest a different colour . <EOS> mm . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> okay , thank you . <EOS> yeah i'll have a go . <EOS> okay . <EOS> sorry . <EOS> please , please leave me a space at the bottom , <EOS> i'm little , <EOS> you can get to the top , with standing on a chair . <EOS>
spongy and fruity . <EOS> but yeah . <EOS> yeah . no . spongy <EOS> and <EOS> spongeball kinda . <EOS> it's not not a lot of trends i uh i found uh <EOS> okay , so <EOS> we have s still one minute left . <EOS> so just <EOS> i think it's okay if you just keep it a bit square . <EOS>
this one , yeah . <EOS> it's only this slide ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> this this is just uh one thing i wanted to mention and show you that i just uh i just found this , <EOS> that our company uh developed a s a seven f seven fingers <EOS> or i'll just <EOS> yeah , <EOS> seven seven inch t_ t_f_t_ screen , <EOS> which is good news for us , since we wanted to include a display there . <EOS> uh so i i probably draw it down raw scheme . <EOS> this is this is the stuff that i can use to <EOS> okay , so the this will be like the overall scheme or overall requirements from the engineering point of view . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> design . mm . <EOS> yeah that's that's why uh i wanted to to make yeah two uh different uh yeah groups of functions . <EOS> the the simple functions for for the the whole public , and the the advanced options for the younger people yeah who are more yeah experienced with uh <EOS>
and you look at competition and design . <EOS> cool . <EOS> so <EOS> we have uh <EOS> yep . <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> wait for emails ? <EOS> uh . <EOS> um . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> okay , groovy . <EOS> and no doubt we'll get um <EOS>
we don't <EOS> it's a scroll . <EOS> that's a scroll . <EOS> uh no we just use it as a scroll . <EOS> ooh . <EOS> okay <EOS> then we have fifteen point eight euros . <EOS> it was a pretty accurate estimate i would say . <EOS> it wasn't bad . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> context-sensitive instructions , depending on what the tel what mode the t_v_ or the d_v_d_ or something else is in . <EOS> right . <EOS> okay <EOS> because i've seen mostly the standard ones , <EOS> yeah . <EOS> now you have it now you have one with the very simple also . <EOS> the idea is simple , but with a display , so you can see what you're doing . <EOS> so maybe if we can incorporate the easiness of use , <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> is it possible that we can bring this up on our own <EOS> yeah it's in the um it's in the project documents . <EOS> is it meeting three minutes ? <EOS> no it's not minutes . <EOS> it's called evaluation criteria . <EOS> okay . <EOS> and it's under evaluation . <EOS>
yeah but this one one of the feature we were not really <EOS> yeah it's the one it's <EOS> m maybe we ha we have two versions , <EOS> the first version , the basic version . <EOS> advanced version we have speak . <EOS> okay . <EOS> i think you can transform the wood into plastic , maybe . <EOS> because uh it seems that this can be <EOS> yeah , wood into plastic and it it should be fine . <EOS>
and it is just uh <EOS> although it's rubberised and spongy , apart from that we're just going to go for sort of vegetable and fruit colours , <EOS> we're not gonna try and make it actually a vegetable or fruit design or anything else , like a shell that we discussed , <EOS> just go for the colours . <EOS>
and then in terms of m material trends are for things to be soft and spongy <EOS> and sort of , you might say ergonomic or or friendly to handle , <EOS> which is which also in indicated that last year this was this was not the case . <EOS> so um probably a lot of the competition on the market will be still in last year's mode , <EOS> so if we try and really capitalise on that , i think that'll be in our favour . <EOS> um <EOS> so these this is the summary of everything . <EOS> um style is number one uh thing in the in the market of who we're selling to . <EOS> uh innovative design technology's also a must in that it's seen it'd be seen to be uh cutting edge , <EOS> uh but ease of use t has to be insured throughout . <EOS> that was like the number three thing . <EOS> and then at the end there are vibrant natural colours um <EOS> that's the way i interpreted it anyway , <EOS> softness in materials , shape , and function , <EOS>
maybe a ball . <EOS> a ball ? <EOS> know , a squashy ball . <EOS> a relaxing squashy ball . <EOS> that you can p <EOS> well i <EOS> see you're thinking , it's weird , you're thinking the opposite of me <EOS> 'cause you're thinking you change the the hard bit <EOS> and i'm thinking how do you change the hard <EOS> would you put a um <EOS>
no <EOS> just to lie down . <EOS> okay . <EOS> and the the cover of the the docking station is also <EOS> we'll go for that . <EOS> on top of the television then ? or not ? <EOS> well <EOS> or besides it . <EOS> and you can just yeah then click it in . <EOS> that's okay . <EOS> um so <EOS> the interface . what type of interface do we want to use ? <EOS> um maybe you can make a little drawing of it on the <EOS>
yeah , <EOS> well , and in little characters you say , yeah , but not too much . <EOS> yes , so can <EOS> i think , safety s <EOS> but yeah , by the squeezing it the <EOS> yeah , we can make the squeezing of the rubber be the be the generating like the energy generator . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> the new remote control is to be original , trendy and user-friendly . <EOS> that , steph , is your part , is the user-friendliness . <EOS> the originality um is gonna take all of us . <EOS> um the trendiness we'll probably go look at for some marketing research information from you , sarah . <EOS> um and we'll get on with it . <EOS> okay , so <EOS> we'll have a functional design individual work um with meeting and then conceptual design t and then detailed design . <EOS> okay ? <EOS>
no , <EOS> just just the corners . <EOS> yeah okay , <EOS> tho those are al already a bit cornered . mm <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> but we can we can do all kinds of uh <EOS> as long as it isn is in two d_ we can use all kind of round shapes . <EOS>
that's right , <EOS> and can we <EOS> can we is it even feasible to make one one remote control with something for everyone , or would we have to use the same electronics and make three different shapes ? <EOS> um the same electronics and basically all that's gonna be different is the plastic case . <EOS> and in that case we could probabl <EOS> moulded plastic isn't all that expensive is it ? <EOS> um you as an industrial person ? <EOS>
mm . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> senden <EOS> okay . so uh <EOS> if that's k uh if that's the problem , you also have to find it easily <EOS> on the remote . <EOS> buttons . like what all colleagues said , have to have to be minimalized . <EOS> or should be covered , <EOS> or in l_c_d_ screen . <EOS> l_c_d_ screen is easy <EOS> because we have the l_c_d_ screen , we have the various options . <EOS> put one option <EOS> and then you have the all the buttons of that options , <EOS> so the other options would be gone . <EOS> and you don't see the buttons . <EOS> so l_c_d_ screens should be easy , <EOS> but an l_c_d_ screen , the problem with the l_ sc l_c_d_ screen is that elderly people fr from forty five to for sixty five years don't use the l_c_d_ screen a lot . <EOS> so we have to that keep that in mind that if you're going to implement l_c_d_ screen , you don't have to make it that hard to learn or to use . <EOS>
bling . you're fired . <EOS> um <EOS> i think you do . <EOS> i i think we have to fill in a questionnaire again , <EOS> but <EOS> yeah <EOS> i have t <EOS> i think we also have to go to our own rooms again , <EOS> but um well <EOS> i at least . <EOS> but maybe you can try uh to make a screen shot of this , <EOS> so i can try to include it in the final report . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> so , either <EOS> i dunno <EOS> we just need to decide on the on the case . <EOS> let's have rubber push buttons , hey . <EOS> okay . <EOS> go rubber . go rubber the whole way . <EOS> let's go crazy . <EOS> and then , do i have a last slide ? <EOS> yes , i do . <EOS> um so the push-buttons themselves they can be just simple or they can be <EOS> so that's just the electronics between the but behind the push-buttons . <EOS> um and the price that go with it with it , <EOS> so the simple push-buttons are gonna be the cheapest . <EOS> uh if we get a scroll-wheel , that's a higher price range . <EOS> if we get an advanced chip which is um used for the l_c_d_ , the display thing , then that's even more expensive . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> um uh now before we go round everybody else , does anybody um <EOS> i <EOS> h have any have anyti ha anything to say about that ? <EOS> i just have a question about that . <EOS> um does it make a difference if there are just a few commands , <EOS> for example if you um can pre-programme in like numbers one through ten <EOS> and pre-programme say , you know , nine channels <EOS> and then just use the voice recognition to say channel one <EOS> and then you've programmed in say b_b_c_ four as your channel one , as your favourite , <EOS> it's like to have a certain number of favourites um <EOS> and that w <EOS>
just press um function eight again . <EOS> last time i did that it sh <EOS> okay . you're right . <EOS> and then again i think . <EOS> one more time . <EOS> oh . <EOS> still not there . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay now i think for this one i could <EOS> would you guys prefer use the whiteboard <EOS> or mayb maybe i'll just do it on right on the screen where you can see it . <EOS> um , we're gonna be doing an evaluation report together based on the protoptype that we've just seen . <EOS> um and looking looking back at my notes from our both our conceptual and our functional meetings , um i made a list of what our original requirements and goals were , <EOS> um , back to our kick-off meeting this morning . <EOS> um , and we'll evaluate as to whether we've s done what we set out to do . <EOS> um and we're gonna do it on a one to seven scale where one is true and seven is false . <EOS> so basically the lower p the lower the points the better . <EOS> okay so question number one . <EOS> does the remote <EOS> whoops . <EOS> sorry . <EOS> oh i'm not gonna be able <EOS> um , i'll do it on the whiteboard . <EOS> i can't change it <EOS> so i'm g i'm gonna ask you to push it down once . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> mm . mm . okay . <EOS> okay . um <EOS> and the demokraphi demographic of the second one ? <EOS> and the demographics of <EOS> it's got the got the the toys in it , <EOS> it's got the l_c_d_ screen <EOS> and <EOS> yeah <EOS> tha tha tha tha tha that's <EOS> i think it's better , <EOS> because of the l_c_d_ screen <EOS> which is really an appeal on the on the on the <EOS>
yeah <EOS> sorry i couldn't get that g to use before . <EOS> quite uh intelligent <EOS> and know know what a normal remote control does . <EOS> um now <EOS> some of the other things i found is a a complicated remote control <EOS> sorry that we can't quite see my red there very well <EOS> but uh this remote control has many functions <EOS> um so it can do a lot of things <EOS> but it uh it is quite complicated <EOS> and most users will find it uh find that they won't use most of the functions <EOS> because they don't know how to use them <EOS> and don't wanna take the time to learn how to do it . <EOS>
huh . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> 'kay . that's nice . uh <EOS> well <EOS> it would certainly make a fancy design . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> but the it wouldn't be very robust . <EOS> it's very fragile <EOS> and you can get scratches on it . <EOS>
. <EOS> we're advanced chip are we ? <EOS> that's the advanced chip-on-print , yeah . <EOS> 'kay , <EOS> we have one of those . <EOS> 'kay then the case is a probably it's double curved . <EOS> double curved , yes . <EOS> case materials are <EOS> plastic . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> no . <EOS> and uh this is kind of the uh the big daddy of remote controls here . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> uh the jumbo universal remote control is almost impossible to misplace or lose . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> i can see . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> but the only problem is that with a mobile phone you signed for a contract <EOS> so they um the companies who uh who you deal with have actually they've they've got an obligation to to help you out <EOS> and also i mean it's it's fair enough to have some sort of help service <EOS> but i i'm not sure how much the cost would be of having <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> right . <EOS> yep . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> with the bu yeah . <EOS> and maybe a menu button and so forth , <EOS> you know um <EOS> use a channel button to scroll through the menu d if they want to record programmes or whatever <EOS> you know <EOS> i mean we can sort that out . <EOS>
alright , excellent . <EOS> okay . <EOS> no . <EOS> it's out of the way as well , i suppose , so . <EOS> excellent . <EOS> so there we go <EOS> and and um we have the banana-based one too . <EOS> oh yeah , yeah . <EOS> yep . <EOS>
so then th th that would <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm . <EOS> it seems to make sense that we we'd just maybe stick with the standard rubber case , <EOS> and then have the standard rubber buttons as well . <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> eur internationally . <EOS> so um <EOS> one of the things i i was gonna mention to you um you guys the designers is that um it m we probably need a rever it needs to be a universal remote control probably . <EOS> okay . <EOS> um so <EOS> something that could do n_t_s_c_ as well as pal as well as various other formats like if it's gonna control d_v_d_s <EOS> but um you know <EOS> i'll leave that to you guys <EOS> but that's something that i i <EOS> it is gonna be an international sold thing . <EOS>
or surfaces . i have no idea . <EOS> i think it might mean something like that sorta shape <EOS> because a double curve rather than a <EOS> yeah that's what . <EOS> mm-hmm yeah that's yeah that's what i see . <EOS> yeah that's what i see also . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> sorta tenth of a second , no matter how long you press it for , <EOS> i don't know i don't actually know . um . <EOS> though i think with digital t_v_ , like i know on my cable box , you're not supposed to do that <EOS> because the channel can't keep up with it if you just press it like that , <EOS> so you're supposed to use the menu and go through the different <EOS>
transmitter . <EOS> transmitter <EOS> actually one one wee thought about that . <EOS> um , if we do end up trying to market this to television manufacturers then the um then the transmitter could actually be built into the television . <EOS> getting the external power source , <EOS> yep , that's quite true . <EOS> um , and something that we can can easily be adopted at the last minute as well i'd say . <EOS> the electronics could be s either placed externally or internally , <EOS> makes no difference to the final product of the actual remote control , <EOS> so that's good . <EOS> uses maybe gives us a new potential market .
yeah . <EOS> you could have volume up and volume <EOS> volume up , down and like that . <EOS> and 'cause the idea was to have limited um <EOS> it was to have sizable amount of information on it . <EOS> limited number of buttons . <EOS> 'cause it was sixteen buttons , wasn't it that were <EOS>
mm . <EOS> sort of have its little dock that you could put it in . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> are we agreed as to what our target group is though ? <EOS> pretty much , <EOS> so that we'd be looking for the younger end . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> well <EOS> i dunno what i woulda shown on that board . <EOS> true , <EOS> but it didn't even occur to me as an option , <EOS> i mean i don't know that i would have <EOS> but i know that i consciously didn't . <EOS>
this is our remote control , with the flip panel as you can see . <EOS> so if you lift up the panel , you can see the lovely yellow l_c_d_ display . <EOS> um , this is actually hard to do . <EOS> the yellow button you have is the on off button , <EOS> so it's really big , hard to miss . <EOS> you have the the red um triangles are the toggles for changing the volume . <EOS> so up volume up , down volume down . <EOS> the green are the channel changing . <EOS> s and it's one of those very light , very touchable displays . <EOS> and then you have the numeric pad in the dark blue at the bottom , <EOS> and on the right-hand side you have the access to the menu on the t_v_ , <EOS> and on the left-hand side you have the the the ability to turn off the voice recognition . <EOS> so this is pretty much what we had on the white board the last time . <EOS>
and new ideas found ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah it's all very new , <EOS> no ? <EOS> it's all very new . <EOS> yeah i think i'd like to um <EOS> i dunno . <EOS> like it was the <EOS> i think the microphones are okay when you're sitting down , <EOS> but like they're kinda clumsy i guess when you're like when you're s going up to the whiteboard like . <EOS>
damn . <EOS> no , <EOS> uh we have fifteen and <EOS> oh , right . <EOS> okay . <EOS> twelve and half . <EOS> we could lose the curve . <EOS> nah . <EOS> we could use <EOS> yeah , i would lose the curve . <EOS> we could lose the scroll wheel . <EOS> you could make it just a regular scroll wheel . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> we have to think about um space in living-rooms , too , <EOS> like 'cause they're <EOS> i mean , would you put it on top of the t_v_ ? <EOS> i don't know , <EOS> just think <EOS> okay , <EOS> that's that's a good idea , <EOS> we'll keep it . <EOS> think it's <EOS>
i mean m my problem <EOS> yeah , yeah . <EOS> 'cause my problem was , you guys had access to like they'd put send you to sites and stuff <EOS> right ? <EOS> see i couldn't do that , so i didn't really know what you guys were doing . <EOS> and when you were talking about it i was just like <EOS> you know that's wh that's why i seemed so ignorant when when you were j explaining things , <EOS> 'cause i <EOS>
that's true , <EOS> i i got this spreadsheet . <EOS> so , yeah , <EOS> i feel like that was slightly lacking <EOS> but then you know , fill in the blanks on your own , level of creativity upped . <EOS> whatever . <EOS> well <EOS> i think that was i think that was an issue i kept finding with regard to <EOS> well <EOS> no <EOS> but also <EOS> yeah <EOS> when i was reporting about what each of us was doing i was often confused as to what you were doing <EOS> um and then i also felt like you know a lot of our discussion would centre around n specifically what my task was <EOS> because that was kind of the interface portion <EOS> which was what the whole project was about <EOS> uh <EOS> but <EOS> and then in the end i think our jobs kind of melded together a little bit more , <EOS> which was fine . <EOS>
true , <EOS> and i probabl <EOS> i think we're banking on selling it to more than just voice recognition people , <EOS> like we want it to work fundamentally as a basic manual too , <EOS> right . <EOS> well we have to have buttons on it too as well . <EOS> but that's done , that's no bother <EOS> i mean if you look at the catalogue from places like with sharper image or whatever you know they might have <EOS> or like um who is it , <EOS> apple makes these really pretentious speakers with the th sub-woofers you know like clear and glass <EOS> and you know <EOS> and then they got these little pyramidal type of um speakers . <EOS> i mean , why not have a little rounded kind of thing , <EOS> it could still have the basic buttons on it . <EOS> um , 'cause we're going for basic functionality primarily as well . <EOS>
for personal preferences i think that to make a baby-proof remote control it got to be a titanium . <EOS> it's a really good style , <EOS> it going to be look like like this . <EOS> it is unbreakable <EOS> and it is very universal . <EOS> w we'll have a screen with a back light <EOS> which can change colours , <EOS>
i'm just really wary of the putting anything on a button . <EOS> why ? <EOS> it'll wear off . <EOS> what's the button <EOS> well , w w then what's the button do , <EOS> and how do you know that that is what the button does ? <EOS> yeah , buttons wear off . <EOS>
we we did a good job of making firm decisions at the ends of the meetings . <EOS> mm . <EOS> sorry . <EOS> and i <EOS> that happened to me all the time though . <EOS> i know what happens sometimes is that you tend to sort of have meetings and then people sorta drift away without anything actually really being decided . <EOS> but i think here we got we got clear and and decisive decisive points at the end of the meetings , <EOS> so that we we knew where to go on from there . <EOS>
okay with <EOS> uh <EOS> don't mean to discourage you <EOS> but uh basically you two are going to work on the smartboard . <EOS> next thirty minutes to design something so <EOS> ah , right . <EOS> alright . <EOS> and the <EOS> you will do the evaluation . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> i mean is that not sort of to assist the blind or something , is it ? <EOS> i guess so . <EOS> i don't know . <EOS> i think that's a bit <EOS> strange . <EOS> then d blind don't watch t_v_ . <EOS> they do ? <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> um unless we come up with some new age product a as far as the casing is concerned . <EOS> i i wanna make this thing something that i can identify as special in some way , <EOS> so maybe we can have some <EOS> i i talked about environmentally sensitive , <EOS> uh maybe we have a product that can be identified in some way as advantageous in a home . <EOS> i don't know . <EOS> these are just thoughts . <EOS> uh i wanted to talk about uh who we are as a as a corporation , <EOS> that we're new , we're aggressive , we're competitive , we're we're trying to provide a product from a new perspective rather than from an old corporate line . <EOS> so to me it's about selling d uh our identity our corporate identity along with the product . <EOS> um what i found is that the projected costs are competitive . <EOS>
alright , alright . <EOS> okay . so <EOS> explore a shape . <EOS> so <EOS> still we want to keep l_c_d_ ? or <EOS> mm i think it's what we say , that we have an uh an l_c_d_ with uh information . <EOS> not uh <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
uh <EOS> so <EOS> i think but th do you agree th that thi <EOS> wait a minute , <EOS> it's not it's not double curved , <EOS> it's single curved , <EOS> right ? <EOS> because it's there is no like . <EOS> yes i <EOS> but i thought it would be curved on two <EOS> it's like it's curved on the sides and curved on the top and bottom as well , that's what i thought . <EOS>
um , yeah , let's think about it <EOS> 'cause we need to wrap up . <EOS> um let's see . <EOS> um so everyone's gonna go finish their questionnaire , <EOS> uh then when we come back after lunch we'll have thirty minutes of individual work , <EOS> um yeah , so think about the things we've discussed and bring some new ideas to our next meeting . <EOS> see you soon . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> oh <EOS> i totally <EOS> yeah <EOS> 'cause i moved it . <EOS> 's put it over here . <EOS> then we don't have to worry about it . <EOS> ready for this ? <EOS> all set ? <EOS> cool . <EOS> alright , <EOS> it is powerpoint time . <EOS> i've done more powerpoints in this particular experiment than i've ever done in my life before this experiment <EOS> which is kind of fun . <EOS>
and i guess the only other thing that we really didn't talk about was or design yet actually , would be the um thing the locator . <EOS> how how so <EOS> oh yeah . <EOS> well the locator is just chip that's inside there . <EOS> okay <EOS> so that's just <EOS>
'kay . <EOS> mm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> that's the tricky thing . <EOS> could we not you know have a shape with a scroll and the screen , <EOS> and then j just sort of that initial shape we had , just which is uh sort of banana-esque . <EOS> so that's thing if we did it yellow . <EOS> and um you know you just p stick on just sort of rubber things that that sort of grip the thumb bit . <EOS> they wouldn't have any <EOS> they're just on the exterior . <EOS> they wouldn't be necessary to the actual shape of the thing . <EOS>
the l_c_d_ <EOS> and the other stuff <EOS> uh , i think . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> and the speech recognition , <EOS> 'cause i think we're definitely going for the speech recognition , <EOS> are we ? <EOS> but in our market survey we have seen that people are willing to pay more , <EOS> but they want the quality , they want f fancy look , they want some new design , something new . <EOS> uh yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so even if we increase our cost little bit , within uh some limits , and we give something new technological advancement as well as new design with fancy outlook , i think we will meet the requirements and we will be able to have a good sales in the market . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> so <EOS> next meeting will be in uh in thirty minutes uh . <EOS> k keep it in mind . <EOS> perfect . <EOS>
oh function , i see it . <EOS> there we go . <EOS> yeah should be <EOS> it should be yeah . <EOS> okay . um . <EOS> this my presentation about the uh technical functions design <EOS> and i basically just tried to focus on um just what what functions we need and how to make that
mm-hmm . <EOS> uh we're kind of in the middle of the market , <EOS> but what i'm seeing is that the market is ready for i i identified new technology , <EOS> but again , because what i see is budget restrictions and limitations , i don't know that we can bring any new technology into this thing . <EOS> if if we could have a technological something <EOS>
but it <EOS> that's on on the display . <EOS> no no . <EOS> that th there is no display there . <EOS> but it's on the place of the display . <EOS> and i think we should uh light this up much more than that part . <EOS> so the focus is on these two parts . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> um . <EOS> and one more time . <EOS> okay , so one more time . <EOS> uh now it's <EOS> okay . <EOS> no ? no . <EOS> should <EOS> yeah just wait for a moment , <EOS> adjusting . <EOS> mm . <EOS> oh okay . <EOS>
and uh change the water every couple of months , <EOS> and buy in a few plants , so . <EOS> other than the fact that they keep dying , <EOS> uh fish are uh are not are are are reasonable pets in that uh they're low maintenance . <EOS> right . <EOS>
i don't think there's a lot of uh voice recognition remote controls . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> w well now the v the voice recognition if if it works wonderfully w we could possibly do away with all buttons , <EOS> but i think this is not really the right moment yet , <EOS> because people are just so used to buttons <EOS> and um , yeah it's it's kind of safer , so we we need both , <EOS> so the voice recognition would be just an extra , <EOS> it wouldn't really reduce the size of the remote . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> five with l_c_d_ and <EOS> well five also uh <EOS> norman please . <EOS> yeah <EOS> from the innovation aspect i feel that uh what is most innovative of our prototype compared to the existing prototypes that we saw l in the last meeting is that um the retrieval of t_v_ programmes by content , <EOS>
or grey . <EOS> right . <EOS> yellow . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> will we go with that then ? <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> sure . <EOS> okay . okay . <EOS> so uh <EOS> just to give you an idea , um you want to go maybe a bit quickly as well , <EOS> i'm not sure how much time . <EOS> we've not hit the five minute mark warning yet , <EOS> but . <EOS>
no . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> but <EOS> yeah . <EOS> right . <EOS> because i think a market will be all kind of people . elderly p el elderly , young people , so . <EOS> but if if it's if it's international you should uh look in <EOS> think in britain they have uh different things they can do with the t_v_ , <EOS> or so uh that you can choose what you want to see . <EOS> i dunno if you should uh take that in consideration , <EOS> or that you just should aim for the normal t_v_s <EOS> that uh <EOS>
h how well these particular prototypes work , <EOS> uh sorta find out what people think of 'em . <EOS> um using a remote control is is quite a subjective experience . um , <EOS> hmm . <EOS> and different different people sort of prefer different things . <EOS> um we should remember that remote controls are a a fairly standard piece of equipment . <EOS> when a users using a remote control , he or she expects the buttons to be in certain places . <EOS> so in some sense we're gonna we're gonna have to aim for a device which is fairly conventional in design <EOS> uh so that we're not completely shocking people . <EOS> but i think within that there is also room for us to introduce novel ideas <EOS> uh and to make something that's that's perhaps a little bit different , something that stands out . <EOS> um also in in designing the user interface we need to consider practicalities . <EOS> uh the first of these is is technological <EOS> ye <EOS> uh what can we do with the current state of technology as it is . <EOS> the second is is economic , <EOS> uh we need to find a balance between features and price . <EOS> so <EOS> as you mentioned <EOS> things like voice recognition would would add to the price <EOS> uh but it would also im improve the design of the product . <EOS>
nine what ? nine channel uh switches ? <EOS> pardon me ? <EOS> nine channel switches ? <EOS> is <EOS> yeah . mm-hmm . mm-hmm . <EOS> yes , nine numbers . <EOS> and then you have swapping of uh button <EOS> by which using which you can swap the channels if you don't want to see the third channel you can swap it to the fourth channel or vice versa . <EOS>
well it's also you can't really try it out <EOS> uh the other things you have have more is are more tangible so from that point of view <EOS> but um <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> i'll give it a three . <EOS> okay . <EOS> two . <EOS>
bob ross . <EOS> dolphin . <EOS> a dolphin . <EOS> okay , um . <EOS> uh i uh draw i <EOS> i've drawn a dolphin because of its intelligence . <EOS> one of the most intelligent uh <EOS> right . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> animals in our world . <EOS>
okay , <EOS> and now you can erase . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i don't think i can , <EOS> but uh we can try . <EOS> uh , we already try . <EOS> well <EOS> it should be possible . <EOS> oh , yeah , <EOS> no , <EOS> ha-ha . <EOS>
yeah , <EOS> we have to hurry up a bit , <EOS> so <EOS> um they they basically said that that's almost the same on any uh remote controls . <EOS> so i guess we j we just need that . <EOS> i don't know what they do <EOS> or <EOS>
yeah yeah . <EOS> we decide . yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> um . maybe w <EOS> yeah , <EOS> that's probably a better one , to discuss it straight away . <EOS> 'cause at that point then you've got the details up there , <EOS> so if we wanted to know for instance that the scroll wheel required the regular and what required advance . then if we were able to see that down then we could make the decision at that point in time <EOS> and then that would be the end of that issue . <EOS> does that make sense ? <EOS>
mm . <EOS> um just literally just metropolitan san diego , <EOS> i live like five minutes from the zoo . <EOS> so <EOS> north park actually if you want to get real specific . <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> my grandparents lived on um thirty second . <EOS>
oh , okay . <EOS> okay ? <EOS> so <EOS> any other questions ? <EOS> uh from her side , i don't think uh there's too many more questions . <EOS> if you can come to the <EOS> okay . <EOS> thank you christine for uh time being , <EOS> so then uh ed , so can you tell about <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> no , but you don't have to use that . <EOS> and you on don't have to pay attention to that second layer . <EOS> that's th that's the main thing that's so good about it . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> no . <EOS> so i think it's easy to use , <EOS> but <EOS> and learnable is a bit <EOS>
uh . <EOS> okay . s <EOS> i'm fine , i'm satisfi <EOS> i'm satisfied . <EOS> we're glad you're satisfied . of course it's it's it's looks more heo heavy , but i think when it's completely maybe it's a less weight . <EOS> yeah . i mean this is plasticene . <EOS> there's only so much you can do . <EOS> we could have possibly made it a lot thinner as well . <EOS>
indeed . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> but <EOS> so <EOS> yes <EOS> dependable , and have a good medium range size . <EOS> okay , <EOS> and um colours , materials ? kendra , anyone ? <EOS> well , <EOS> most i think most of the remote controls now are either just black or grey , <EOS> so maybe we should go with something different <EOS> or be able to <EOS> i was just thinking of um what they're doing with mobile phones now <EOS> how you can get the different um what are they called ? like the face-plates <EOS> that you change <EOS> so we could have maybe <EOS> i don't know if it would be feasible to do something with that , <EOS> where you can change the face-plates <EOS> or have kind of a variety <EOS> so people can get different different things . <EOS> have it kind of look how they want to , different colours , things like that , <EOS> probably just plastic <EOS> because that's always the lightest . <EOS>
let's move on . <EOS> mm . <EOS> oops , let's close that . <EOS> next meeting , uh okay . <EOS> w what does i_d_v_i_d_n_m_e_ stand for ? <EOS> industrial designer <EOS> um which is <EOS> ah ri okay . <EOS> these are requirement specification . <EOS> that's <EOS> um . <EOS>
instead of rubber , let it be plastic . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> and uh that much money will be required for the base station , which is not there . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so mayb in fact n we have to put two here <EOS> because it cost nothing . <EOS>
also the <EOS> just just going back to the interface designs with the buttons , <EOS> the <EOS> i kno we were planning to do some sort of touch screen . <EOS> now what i was saying before about instead of having <EOS> you could have just a bare p_c_b_ circuit board <EOS> and i'm sure you could probably get it in different colours <EOS> and so just by touching it with your finger it'd make the connection <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> hm . <EOS> oh , it just gives an answer . <EOS> oh , then then <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i thought i thought it was when they said <EOS> just if you are really lonely , maybe . <EOS> i thought when they said , voice recognition , they meant um like , <EOS> channel five , and it will change . <EOS> like you talk to it . <EOS> can i have channel five ? <EOS> oh , then forget about it . <EOS> oh right okay . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> well why don't we do it like a mouse then ? <EOS> yeah if you are holding it in your hand you could you could do that , couldn't you ? <EOS> if you're holding it in your hand you could <EOS>
okay . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> okay , <EOS> is there anything else at all it can do ? <EOS> mm 'kay . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> that <EOS> 'cause that's that's fine . <EOS> just need to know so i can write it down . <EOS> okay um right <EOS> i g i guess that's it , <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> i find myself , especially if i'm in a crowd of people , looking really silly . <EOS> so <EOS> maybe if you're sitting on your couch with a bunch of people then <EOS> yeah . <EOS> and wou i don't know if would <EOS> would you want to keep saying stuff if you were watching stuff . <EOS> if you were watching something would you sort of be wanting <EOS>
ah i see , okay . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> logo . <EOS> okay , brilliant . <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay , so the buttons would be like , you know individual users , or <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah and <EOS> yeah they might project things onto the screen which you can do on there . <EOS> mm i'm not sure about that . <EOS> um and this one is the one w more like the one w that we looked at earlier . <EOS> yeah , you guys can have a look at that if you want . <EOS>
but all that you need to keep in mind your knowledge management . um just wanna make sure you do . <EOS> no the first one that you sent like i didn't realise that it was a joke <EOS> and i was like why did she send this to us ? <EOS> it's very it's very work relevant , <EOS> 'cause people send spam a lot . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> i mean uh some uh i <EOS> l like think of a fruit that could sit sort of independently on its own like uh , i dunno , an apple . <EOS> yeah , do we need buttons ? <EOS> mm . <EOS> then it's just apple so sort of <EOS> uh , yellow apples though hmm . <EOS>
i think we should take that as an action item for after the meeting , <EOS> 'cause w our meeting time has run out . <EOS> somebody else has go to use this room , <EOS> and , you know , we can't hang out here <EOS> and talk about this , so <EOS>
yeah , <EOS> i have , <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay , well wh uh <EOS> why would it be a a need to have a normal button ? <EOS> well <EOS> i <EOS> i guess if you use the l_c_d_ screen , you first have to search where is the on button , <EOS> then you uh you you <EOS> then turn it , <EOS> and then the t_v_ goes on . <EOS> but if you have a normal on button on the on the remote , then you do the on , <EOS> and then you search the channel which you want . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> mm . <EOS> right . <EOS> talking of which maybe a scrolling function is not not too bad . <EOS> 'kay <EOS> so <EOS> it's <EOS> talk about maybe f <EOS> look at that from the side , there maybe . <EOS> which is technically the easiest option . <EOS> would probably be like a scrolling , little scrolling wheel like this . <EOS> yeah . yeah . yeah . so . <EOS>
yep . <EOS> um . <EOS> plastic . <EOS> is there any rubber at all in the buttons or any <EOS> i think we're gonna have to skip the rubber . <EOS> okay , <EOS> um and we wanted special colours didn't we ? <EOS> so i'll have to put that <EOS> oh no wait we <EOS> ho how many colours have we got there ? <EOS>
'kay uh <EOS> pens are over here . <EOS> i'll try the red pen . <EOS> the three pens are underneath . <EOS> okay . um . <EOS> i'm gonna go for the bear <EOS> which i'm be able to draw very well , <EOS> you get marks for artistic impression . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> hey i just thought this thing <EOS> there is a <EOS> i mean you know there is are some with a wheel like this . <EOS> instead of having the up down buttons for uh you can have the wheel . <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
fine . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> but it can be uh battery consuming , no ? <EOS> to have the light always on ? <EOS> yeah , a little bit . <EOS> a little bit . <EOS> mm . <EOS> well we will discuss that after maybe <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm no , not really . <EOS> um yeah , <EOS> just i just wanted to ask then before we wrap up , <EOS> shall we agree for sake of um sort of clarity and when we when we r resume that we'll u use this idea david's proposed , <EOS> where we think of these three sort of buckets and anything anything we discuss about them is sort of , okay , we're talking about this . <EOS> shall we do that , then ? <EOS> okay , great . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> but i dunno how much any of this has to do with the fashionable , sort of cool looking thing <EOS> that we also need to focus on . <EOS> could we maybe have like an extra button on the top for on off ? <EOS> so then w we wouldn't have to have like a dual function ? <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> it i it wasn't too much . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> as well as the l_c_d_ screen . <EOS> whoa . <EOS> okay , well <EOS> this is it . <EOS> um maybe i could ask one of you to uh fill it in , <EOS> so that i can also uh take minutes , <EOS> and uh maybe the other can uh use that thing to count uh numerous functions . <EOS>
i'll have t i'll have to move it won't i ? <EOS> uh , whoops . <EOS> will it manage ? <EOS> bit more , <EOS> oh dear . <EOS> we just do the best we can . <EOS> you'll have to push it a bit more . <EOS> yep . <EOS> yeah this is more than enough . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah , so this is one of the interface or one of the remote which has this vi voice recogniser . <EOS> and this has multi-purpose use , it can be used for t_v_ , it can be used for cable-satellite , it can be used for v_c_r_ , d_v_d_s and audio . <EOS>
yeah you can <EOS> yeah ? <EOS> mm-hmm flashy . <EOS> so more like <EOS> mm bzz . <EOS> doesn't work very well . <EOS> uh . more like this colour . <EOS> yeah something like that , something that stands out more . <EOS> and then then yellow and orange and red objects on it or something . <EOS> but then then again , which colour should the buttons be ? <EOS>
or little <EOS> or just just a wheel , you know . <EOS> just if you <EOS> like <EOS> you'd have a remote for your remote , <EOS> that'll . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> well , <EOS> but if you could attach them to the t_v_ , then you can . <EOS>
no . <EOS> export . <EOS> well <EOS> i can i can uh <EOS> export h_t_m_l_ . <EOS> no , <EOS> and use an image if possible . <EOS> huh , image ? <EOS> j_ peg . <EOS> g_ <EOS> yeah , j_ peg . <EOS> j_ peg . yeah , it's better <EOS>
uh yeah . <EOS> you know what i mean ? <EOS> mm yeah . <EOS> okay , <EOS> we got five minutes to go in this meeting , <EOS> so um <EOS> i d <EOS> i think we've actually very conveniently just uh come to uh a good point to s to sum up um . <EOS>
turning the t_v_ o on o or off . <EOS> so , <EOS> adding some vocal commands . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> simple ones ? <EOS> yeah , simple ones <EOS> for <EOS> okay . <EOS> so <EOS> the next meeting will start in thirty meeti minutes <EOS> so <EOS> we'll you will all have to work in in your direction . <EOS> so you will have to work on the look and feel design , to have the easy to use , powerful and fancy remote control with some added value such as the uh simple vocal commands recognition . <EOS> uh you will have to work more , baba , on the um spongy way to to add spongy um touch to the buttons <EOS> and try to find maybe a nice shape for the wooden remote control . <EOS>
just <EOS> it's <EOS> oh <EOS> my god . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> you know tha that's the weak point , <EOS> because with a traditional one you just have one hand . <EOS> you use your y <EOS> yeah , but nobody would be able to take it in the pocket and bring it in the kitchen and say i've lost the remote control . <EOS> nobody would take it . <EOS> so nobody w will lost lose it . <EOS>
alright . <EOS> uh a nice material . uh <EOS> mm . <EOS> and for the buttons , um it can have the scroll wheel <EOS> which they use in mouses for com p_c_s . <EOS> uh but um it requires a more expensive chip to use , <EOS> and if you wanna use l_c_d_ it's even more expensive . <EOS> so <EOS> you have to decide , <EOS> there's trade-offs there . um <EOS> if you want the buttons to be <EOS> oh yeah , <EOS> if you have a double curve uh control and it's rubber , then you have these rubber buttons as well . <EOS> but you're gonna ha <EOS> i reckon you're gonna have to have uh key a number keypad anyway for the amount of channels these days . <EOS> you wouldn't want to just have to scroll through all the channels to get to the one you want . <EOS> you wanna enter just the number of it , if you know it . <EOS> so um <EOS> i reckon we're gonna have to have a number keypad anyway . <EOS> do you think ? <EOS>
it's just different <EOS> it's just different from everything else <EOS> and i mean , i'm trying to imagine um clean looking houses , <EOS> sort of beige and black <EOS> um so you either want something that goes with that , <EOS> which is what's on the market anyway , <EOS> or you want something that contrasts as <EOS> you know like you get clocks now that are more of a talking point than an actual clock because they're so interesting and <EOS>
but still the next it's still the next one . <EOS> doesn't make <EOS> yeah , <EOS> but the top the top button is is like you switch channel up , <EOS> and down button is if you put them <EOS> yeah , <EOS> but fo from left to right is exactly the same . <EOS> it ma it doesn't make a big difference . <EOS>
uh okay . <EOS> 'kay . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> we hope so . <EOS> of course . <EOS> so uh , i noticed your talk about speech recognition and whistling , <EOS> and uh i was just curious to know , have we done any research into how many people can whistle ? <EOS> um , or if <EOS> is that a function we want in the remote ? <EOS>
two or three . <EOS> two point five . <EOS> don't use my opinion . <EOS> that's okay . yeah . <EOS> um <EOS> neither are all o all the customers we have , either . <EOS> does it feel good ? <EOS> imagine , <EOS> since we obviously don't have that . <EOS>
's a good idea . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> i know . <EOS> you know what i'm getting at here , <EOS> fel look at it from the side . it's like that . <EOS> right . uh <EOS> look g <EOS> yeah . <EOS> looks good . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS>
our remote , <EOS> we do not want to make it p_d_a_ . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> um . <EOS> so is mine . <EOS> it's mine . <EOS> participant one , no ? <EOS> oh . <EOS> yeah , this your <EOS> mm . <EOS> oh we have <EOS> so let's move to to user interface design . <EOS>
right . <EOS> um we've got to make something as fashionable as possible , <EOS> that's kind of the corporate strategy is we're gonna try to take ordinary stuff <EOS> that nobody really thinks about <EOS> and try to make it nice <EOS> you know <EOS> like john lewis nice or you know if you go to debenham's or something . <EOS> so um basically <EOS> we are reinventing the wheel <EOS> but we wanna try to do it in a user friendly um slick sleek kind of way . <EOS> um way we're gonna go about doing that is basically at first we're gonna start on the basics . <EOS> and that's where i'm gonna need you guys the user interface designers and the um um the other designer <EOS> that i can't remember , <EOS> the the i_d_ and the u_i_d_ <EOS> right <EOS> um the industrial designer <EOS> hey right on alright , <EOS> getting into it um <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> yes . <EOS> mm . <EOS> might be an interesting way to go . <EOS> fabulous . <EOS> slick , slick . <EOS> um , yeah so <EOS> something to sit on for now . <EOS> so <EOS> overall i think we should stick with what we're finding , <EOS> everyone's looking for easy to use , technologically innovative and this fancy new <EOS> i think perhaps the double curve thing and maybe this rubber option is our best way to go for right now . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> what is spongy ? <EOS> yeah <EOS> kind of um maybe <EOS> when we were talking about rubber , <EOS> i think uh the rubber aspect might be important <EOS> because it's what is probably more feasible in terms of sponginess . <EOS> yeah <EOS> it <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS>
you set ? <EOS> yep , cool . <EOS> okay , <EOS> functional requirements . <EOS> uh we need to do the function key thing so that it comes up on here . <EOS> alright , yeah . <EOS> hello . <EOS> try to press <EOS> oh , okay , <EOS> yep . <EOS>
less buttons <EOS> so it must be . <EOS> uh <EOS> we we <EOS> uh yeah <EOS> it was our it was a <EOS> we made an actual effort to <EOS> yeah <EOS> it is sorta the the handle more ergonomically correct as well . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> one being true . <EOS> so <EOS> i uh two , <EOS> three . <EOS> two . <EOS> okay , <EOS> actu that's pro that's gonna get confusing , like that . <EOS> okay so question number two was is it techn technologically innovative ? <EOS> so i know we have the kinetic energy which is very innovative . <EOS>
i find myself hitting the send and receive button on the email a lot , just out of boredom , <EOS> like c come on gimme something . <EOS> i , <EOS> yeah , <EOS> pretty compulsively during meetings , like , yeah . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah . oh yeah . yeah i know . <EOS> come on give me some information . <EOS> well <EOS> to be fair we're we're hooked we're all hooked on the internet , <EOS> so i mean i do the <EOS>
yep , <EOS> yeah , <EOS> good , good . <EOS> uh-huh . <EOS> yep , <EOS> right . <EOS> uh-huh . <EOS> mm . <EOS> s <EOS> yep , <EOS> yep , <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> and so we figured it would be kind of you know a light weight plastic , <EOS> just kind of a light non-descript grey <EOS> so that people'll wanna buy the covers <EOS> and then the covers will be that sort of rubbery material like they make ipod covers , <EOS> so they kinda just stretch over . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> yeah , that's meant with scr uh with s curve . <EOS> the curve is uh in a dimension . <EOS> if you make it a flat one , s n it's no curve , you got no curves . <EOS> yeah , okay . <EOS> was that <EOS> does that mean to it , single curve ? <EOS>
amplify the signal and all that is being sent to the infrared lamp up there . <EOS> now as you can see this is the the rubber button version of it . <EOS> um the way it works is that you have the keys here . <EOS> the rubber button has a little metal uh plate on the other side , which closes the circuit here . <EOS> and thus gives on the signal . <EOS> now this is the simple version . <EOS> um we are talking um this this the simple and cheapest version at the same time . <EOS> we are talking something more complicated of course , it's going to be more expensive as well . <EOS> and not only that . <EOS> um we are also restricted in the use of our outer shell , or in the material that we could use for our outer shell . <EOS> um i've gotten some information that we could use for the case material plastic , <EOS> rubber , as well . <EOS> um rubber that is used in these anti-stress balls . <EOS> so it's pretty squishy . <EOS> that would that would serve that purpose . <EOS> um we could also use wood , or titanium . <EOS>
change the batteries ever again . <EOS> and and this is all tying in very nicely . <EOS> the fact that it's made out of this rubber , we can throw it about . <EOS> th we should encourage people to throw their remote controls about , because it charges itself up by doing it . <EOS>
yes , it will have uh these buttons will have the numbers and all the rest of the buttons will have symbols . <EOS> yes , which can be easily recognised . <EOS> ah . <EOS> yeah , definitely . <EOS> will have symbols so that that that the user really knows you know and doesn't have to first learn it <EOS>
that looks different , yeah . <EOS> hmm . 'cause otherwise we will just make another standard , <EOS> and our uh motto also is <EOS> is leds uh beneath the the buttons ? <EOS> yeah , w around the buttons , or in the buttons even . <EOS> yeah , okay . <EOS>
possibly . <EOS> yeah , that's the thing , <EOS> because <EOS> but but the thing is when you use a remote control , you never look at it , <EOS> right ? <EOS> you're looking at the t_v_ <EOS> and and it's uh <EOS> it just seems kind of like a a needless th <EOS>
i use teletext as well . <EOS> no , <EOS> i use te teletext every day , i think . <EOS> hmm . okay . <EOS> yeah . for me too , it is . <EOS> so <EOS> we just keep it one level then ? <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah yeah , one level . <EOS> and i think , uh 'cause um we don't have that many buttons , <EOS> i think the design is most important . <EOS> you can d uh integrate the buttons in the design very much . <EOS>
mm . yeah . <EOS> but and <EOS> the problem is i i'm we can infer i if you have v voice control why not to put it directly on the the t_v_ , so speak directly to the t_v_ and you don't need a remote control actually , <EOS> so . <EOS>
so it's just like . <EOS> we deci <EOS> yeah , <EOS> so it's all accessible . without m taking your hand off the remote . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah <EOS> um we went for like a a circular design for the numbers <EOS> because we thought that's kind of a more natural movement than just going like that with your thumb . <EOS> uh e ergonomics are all considered . <EOS> yeah .
it's the standard <EOS> yeah , uh <EOS> but you have you had a lot of different buttons . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> we but we don't we don't really have any complicated buttons . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> maybe you have you have to <EOS> uh when you use teletec teletext , you can press a green or a red button to go to the next one , or to go to the previous one . <EOS>
mm-hmm , yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> and your part is very related to mine <EOS> because when you suggest something then it has to be integrated inside . <EOS> so <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah so <EOS> i'll i'll go with that actually <EOS> so um <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS>
isn't that a better signal ? <EOS> i just think that it's it's gonna cost more <EOS> and i'm i'm not sure it's you're gonna use it . <EOS> yeah , yeah i d it sounds like you you w don't wanna overcomplicate things . <EOS> you know we don't need it . <EOS>
yes , <EOS> but but but ab about the spec the buttons , the buttons uh that will be on it . i i think we can discuss that in the in the next meeting . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> uh i would like to get this wrapped up <EOS> and go to an end of this meeting . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> and that's it . okay . <EOS> no so we hin <EOS> and we have sample speaker . yeah . yeah . <EOS> the cost of that is very high . <EOS> yeah so one . <EOS> ooh ye ye ye <EOS> the cost is increasing . <EOS> so we are <EOS>
oh <EOS> it's a side view . <EOS> side view yes it's side view <EOS> so uh <EOS> i i'm not technically good at th three d_ modelling , <EOS> but . <EOS> um uh it's just an idea i had <EOS> so it's uh it's very uh <EOS> so its also looks nice when it's on the table . <EOS> um the graphical user interface and the buttons , uh we also thought about that already . <EOS> uh i thought about uh the l_c_d_ touch screen , <EOS> which is uh is easy to clean too . <EOS>
right . <EOS> well , i'm just basically letting you know what's happening in the markets <EOS> mm yeah . <EOS> and what the fashions are for next year . um . <EOS> so yes , <EOS> so from looking at this year's trends and fashions <EOS> and also recent investigation that we've done in the remote control market , <EOS> we have found that for the remote control market these are like most important aspects like that we really need to <EOS> which we've already probably discussed . <EOS> um the most important aspect is look and feel . <EOS> so the remote control has to look and feel fancier than the ones that already that we already have . <EOS> so it has to be <EOS>
six is a good <EOS> okay . <EOS> good . <EOS> uh if we say that seven it's uh it's the better , <EOS> and when uh s six sit six are good it's a good uh p product , i think . <EOS> yeah , the top <EOS> yeah , <EOS> the be . <EOS> okay , so <EOS> six is a <EOS>
mm . <EOS> i i s usually put more money than brains . <EOS> yeah , exactly . <EOS> bu but what i was gonna say was , although they they may be buying um , you know , personal music devices and all that , <EOS> are they necessarily buying t_v_ remote controls ? <EOS> because they probably live in a household that has a t_v_ if they're at the lower end of the age range , <EOS> i don't know . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> okay , so <EOS> so buttons . <EOS> things that are always used . <EOS> okay , just like that . <EOS> that's cool . <EOS> i like it . <EOS> um . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> with the scroll-wheel or no ? <EOS> yeah , what about the scroll wheel and speech recognition ? <EOS>
how how far we actually want to go along and sort of follow the trends , <EOS> do we think the trends are particularly important for this type of gadget , <EOS> or or you know , do they not matter that much ? <EOS> i think if you start making the buttons fruit shaped , it might make it more complicated to use . <EOS>
yeah i think so . <EOS> something , <EOS> what is the u_i_ ? <EOS> yeah , what does it stand for again ? <EOS> user interface designer . <EOS> so that's gonna be <EOS> user . <EOS> that's me . <EOS> uh , user interface design . <EOS> more technical . <EOS> i guess that maybe the working design has also to do with like the physical feat like just the way it looks and the way it w <EOS>
well no ma yeah <EOS> maybe a bit more then th is on here <EOS> but ju just as a kind of an inspiration , these pens i think are are kind of <EOS> okay . <EOS> so then if we <EOS> d d do we want to do anything more basic with the uh more advanced with the user interface in terms of do we want to go for um buttons , <EOS> or do we want if we're ditching the scroll wheels do we want to go l_c_d_ ? <EOS> do we want to give do we want to have anything else on it ? <EOS>
right . <EOS> mm . <EOS> we've already kind of covered this as well . that seems to be selling <EOS> um and we we've more or less agreed that we want to kar target this youth market , um . <EOS> especially now with eighteen to thirty five year olds being such a large quantity of the population . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> work harder . <EOS> okay shou should we make a list of the of all the functions we want uh <EOS> yeah . whatever . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah we want to incorporate in uh into it . <EOS> uh <EOS> yeah . <EOS> 'kay . um <EOS> for those that didn't see yet um the basic new requirements of the management were no teletext , only for t_v_ . <EOS> uh it should be designed for a use g uh group below forty , <EOS> but i don't think it's w wrong if we can uh target the current customer group as well . <EOS>
oh no . <EOS> well <EOS> you can draw over it with white uh pen . <EOS> oh . <EOS> no ? <EOS> yeah , <EOS> we tried it earlier . <EOS> it's very much work . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> sorry . <EOS> well <EOS> but that's also useful for the evaluation , <EOS> because i think uh we have a prototype now <EOS> which we can afford <EOS> and uh we only need to draw a little bit to get a good uh <EOS>
so uh this is the the schema of the o of the future uh remote controls <EOS> so uh you can you can see the components , uh battery <EOS> and uh the two chips goes to the infrared uh connection to the t_v_ set . <EOS> did you draw it ? <EOS>
it look like a dinosaurs . <EOS> yeah , okay . <EOS> because i like <EOS> uh okay . <EOS> a pink elephant . <EOS> just takes so long , <EOS> okay . <EOS> whatever , <EOS> just . <EOS> you erased this one . <EOS> it's a bit slow you can see , <EOS> this is a bit annoying . <EOS>
yeah , yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> but do you know , this shape also kind of les lend itself to to voice <EOS> 'cause if you're you're holding it and you're fiddling , <EOS> but you can also bring it up like that <EOS> and it's microphone-esque , <EOS> yeah , yeah . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i suppose we maybe are limited in the fact that we still have to put the logo on the actual <EOS> would or not . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> well , you might be limited in space , that yes . <EOS> well you two are obviously gonna find that out fairly quickly when you move over to your kit modelling stage as to uh how much pl how much how much how pliable is plasticine . <EOS>
it's done ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> just have to <EOS> so <EOS> we have break . <EOS> present project , <EOS> discuss a little bit about it . <EOS> oh my god . <EOS> oh , <EOS> we have twenty five minutes for the meeting . <EOS>
what do you mean ? <EOS> yeah , <EOS> but we we we are we have yellow , red , uh black , titanium . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> but uh when you use more than one colour , it's a special colour . <EOS> ah okay . <EOS> oh . <EOS> but i think when you use the colour that's not originally the rubber then you use special colour , <EOS> 'cause you have to add it . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> and we don't w <EOS> i mean so many remote controls look absolutely identical , <EOS> these long , brown things with the same coloured buttons all crammed in on the s the surface . <EOS> we definitely <EOS> an ob an obvious thing , a very simple thing is to get away from these brown rectangles , <EOS> we don't want that . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , th that's weird . <EOS> yeah , because the prices uh could be twenty euros or something now . <EOS> and then <EOS> yeah , and if you had uh fifteen euros , then we would it . <EOS> we had to <EOS>
yeah , <EOS> of course , yeah . <EOS> now what , what are our special features for the marketing ? <EOS> that's really the voice recognition that's really unusual <EOS> i think voice recognition is our big selling point <EOS> 'cause nobody else seems to have that in in this price range . <EOS>
uh . <EOS> yeah , i <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yes , i i feel that all the remote should be very compact . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> those which we get here nowadays it's very long . <EOS> and um and it should have multi-purpose . <EOS> like uh the remote control which we use for t_v_ , it shou uh it should be used f uh for some other purpose also , like controlling the uh temperature inside the house or for air-conditioners , or for heating system . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> f weeks . <EOS> yeah . that's right . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> right . <EOS> next slide ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> and we are having the speakers regular chip for control . <EOS> pricing is was a factor so that's why we have gone for a regular chip only not the advanced chip . <EOS> and uh that's it . <EOS>
um well <EOS> w w we can still discuss that . <EOS> so um , <EOS> and together with evaluating this uh we we might come with new ideas <EOS> i mean adding things or uh removing uh of options <EOS> because they are too expensive , <EOS> but <EOS> okay . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS>
um i assume that's what else we're gonna like h ha the um the additional buttons we can use . <EOS> um <EOS> oh . <EOS> so we're gonna have like a menu button , <EOS> so that we can access on-screen things then ? <EOS> okay , <EOS> um so <EOS> we're doing an on-screen menu that we can scroll through . <EOS>
mm mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> so <EOS> mm . <EOS> i like the idea too of being able to use the remote in the dark , <EOS> so either having the buttons so you can feel the difference between them <EOS> or if they if they light up or something . <EOS>
wi an indoors . <EOS> oh . <EOS> yeah okay . <EOS> calculator's can do it . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> so um <EOS> for the uh a case , there's uh the traditional uncurved flat hard case . <EOS> single curved , which means that it has uh curves in one dimension . <EOS> or the double curved . <EOS> um i wasn't able to finish my uh personal preferences sheet , <EOS> but well you know that we will have to go for the double curved 'cause it's daring and different from what we have now . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> uh a remote controller is specifically designed to a single device . <EOS> if you want to design it for multiple devices then you should make all the devices compatible with the frequency <EOS> like uh th the remote controller it sends some bits some uh waves like with a particular frequency <EOS> the device should know what the frequency is . <EOS> it should re re recognise the uh waves which are coming from the remote controller and it should take the action <EOS> like if you press a button channel or something like that then uh the remote uh remote controller will send a send a se send a signal , <EOS> and the t_v_ it should translate that into like change the channel or something like that , change the volume control <EOS> and uh so uh i think it's hard to design a remote controller for multiple uh devices . <EOS>
oh . <EOS> so we can't erase anything . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> nice application ? <EOS> well <EOS> you can erase it with the eraser , <EOS> but uh you shouldn't delete an entire page , <EOS> but just create a new blank one . <EOS> i will delete this one now <EOS> because we don't use it yet . <EOS>
yeah . yeah . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah <EOS> everybody's got a mobile phone right ? <EOS> except for me now . uh <EOS> but they are all , <EOS> you know , <EOS> mobile phones um they've kind of taken a turn to where they're really small . <EOS> um which may defeat our purpose for being able to locate our remote all the time . <EOS> but then again you don't want you know like the first mobile phone <EOS> that was this big <EOS> and you had a handbag to carry it around in . um <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> what are we going to do about this vegetable thing that i'm dreading ? <EOS> oh god . <EOS> oh , i was gonna say . <EOS> you said uh people want spongy . <EOS> um , one of your <EOS> one of the material options is a sort of rubber that's in like those stress ball things . <EOS> so , that would be spongy . <EOS>
yeah , <EOS> it <EOS> most of the ones we've had have had the menu button , <EOS> 'cause it's not like you need to have a button access to like change the contrast or something . <EOS> 'cause it just doesn't come up every day or something . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> well so <EOS> so , do we need <EOS> i dunno . <EOS> well i guess we have to you know think about <EOS> but i mean you just basically need the output signal you know to be able to bring it up . <EOS> that's what it does anyway . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> do we feel it's very easy to use ? <EOS> are we going to indi <EOS> i say we individually rate <EOS> what do you say ? <EOS> just orally . <EOS> why not ? <EOS> we have <EOS> okay . <EOS> true or false , easy to use . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> on the screen , you mean ? <EOS> not on the control , but on the screen . <EOS> well , this would avoid l_c_d_ , then . <EOS> i don't <EOS> oh , i don't but i don't think we're we're the ones . <EOS> i mean this remote control we're developing is a generic control for all t_v_s , i think . <EOS>
so , <EOS> that's kind of a new idea for me is like just sort of that idea , <EOS> well you know it's kind of s hard to keep f working forward on a team a team based project when when you're told you must now work away from your team . <EOS>
ok okay . <EOS> there was a step about drawing something in the in the board , <EOS> i don't know . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> maybe should go and draw an animal . <EOS> is it ? <EOS> are we supposed to do right now ? <EOS> yeah yeah , <EOS> you try . try first . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> i think i've learned not to bring play-dough to meetings . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i think it would be a good idea , i like it . <EOS> it's hard enough to get people actually paying attention . <EOS> especially if you have food . <EOS> so i guess we're supposed to write final reports . <EOS> 'cause <EOS>
yep . <EOS> now i'm gonna have to work between the uh the slides and the uh <EOS> yeah . <EOS> and the white board <EOS> 'cause i actually i have some fairly concrete things this time . <EOS> uh um i was given a an h_t_m_l_ file giving um various ideas from uh from other previous remote control designs , <EOS> and pretty much decided to just dump them all . <EOS> i wasn't very impressed by them <EOS> and they didn't seem to re <EOS> uh nothing i saw seemed to meet the sorts of design specifications that we're going for today . <EOS> um so <EOS> what i ra <EOS> rather than looking at other remotes , uh ra oomp be better to simply look at the human hand . <EOS> um and try and f um and try and figure out a way of laying out the elements we've already decided on , <EOS> um so that if r a if so that the finger is e each finger or thumb is wherever it needs to be already . <EOS> um so uh <EOS> next slide , if you please . <EOS> um and what we've basically decided on was the the um the joy uh the joystick , two function buttons and the l_c_d_ , <EOS> just keep it paired down to the absolute minimum . <EOS>
right , <EOS> and then you're dealing with ports and cords and <EOS> 's too much . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> and they just <EOS> yeah <EOS> i think that one might just be out of the range for this particular <EOS> a p_d_a_ would they would <EOS> makes a lot of sense for a p_d_a_ <EOS> 'cause you're gonna be using it to connect up to things anyway <EOS> but <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> now we better actually just get on with the uh the meat of the project . <EOS> so <EOS> i'm gonna guess that we've all used remote controls . <EOS> any ideas of where you think a new remote control could go into this market ? <EOS>
do you think the computers just provide distraction in a meeting ? <EOS> i think too many computers are just distracting . <EOS> um <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> i know i i like to have things written down in front of me actually , <EOS> like a lot of the stuff that was emailed to me i ended up you know like writing down there or something so i could look at it really quickly and not have the distraction of all of that , <EOS> um i don't know about anybody else . <EOS>
yep . <EOS> but this this but this would never happen anyway . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> they cannot speak at the same time . <EOS> why ? <EOS> yeah <EOS> if you have one brother and one sister <EOS> and they want to watch their favourite uh t_v_ programme , <EOS> so they say oh channel four channel three channel four channel three all the time , <EOS> so . <EOS>
uh yeah . <EOS> forty no sorry for forty five to fifty five age group , uh to put myself right in the middle of it , um u use remote controls to a great extent . <EOS> yes we <EOS> um no <EOS> this is for pay more for speech recognition . <EOS>
mm , okay . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> it's <EOS> and with no increase in the pri production price of the remote control ? <EOS> oh yeah yeah yeah yeah . <EOS> because of this product uh this technology has already been developed . <EOS> so <EOS> but <EOS> yeah , <EOS> but how will you <EOS>
i think it mm <EOS> cool . <EOS> feedback ? <EOS> ideas ? <EOS> yeah mm , <EOS> as far as creativity is concerned , yeah i think there was there was room for creativity . <EOS> the only the only problem being that at the end we had to cut some things down because of the the budget we had . <EOS>
yeah , but it's a scroll and click , isn't it ? <EOS> mm . <EOS> okay , yeah , okay . <EOS> okay , cool . <EOS> so that that solves the whole mute issue . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> and okay , so i so the the voice recognition is also just part of it . <EOS> you can't really see it in the interface . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> you could have developed multiple skins really had you had more colours . <EOS> i know <EOS> it could have been amazing . <EOS> oh well . <EOS> what did you guys think about the the the roles ? <EOS> hmm . <EOS> they were good . <EOS>
so shall i go to <EOS> sorry . <EOS> uh thank you , <EOS> so you did a powerpoint presentation , good for you . <EOS> yep . s <EOS> okay , let's go to a_m_i_ . <EOS> it's not the biggest powerpoint presentation in the world , but <EOS> so in two or three or <EOS>
uh it looks threatening . <EOS> yeah , it does look kind of dangerous . <EOS> it looks like <EOS> yeah . <EOS> um this one i thought was really cool . <EOS> it's w it's got the programmability function that we talked about . <EOS> you can put it in there , <EOS> it's for your kids , <EOS> and it's quite an organic shape <EOS> and the little circle around there is pretty cool . <EOS> and that's really easy to use , bright , <EOS> so i like this one lot for our design . <EOS> i think something like that would be good . <EOS> of course yellow . <EOS>
uh but i'm also equally taken with this chunky plastic kiddie remote , <EOS> mm . <EOS> um which is really nice and fun and good to hold and nice , big , easy buttons to press , <EOS> but still quite simple and quite cost effective . <EOS> so <EOS>
forty <EOS> yeah <EOS> it's it is <EOS> standard remote . <EOS> pretty <EOS> no <EOS> i think we can <EOS> and not innovative <EOS> i think we can do a lot with the design and the simple buttons <EOS> which were also mentioned . <EOS> uh if we put a lot of effort in those , we can make a remote control with uh just two or three buttons . or just a remote which is suitable for the market we wanna reach <EOS> because it is forty percent of the market . <EOS>
no no . <EOS> we definitely shouldn't do it in our factory . <EOS> so we'll do it in the other place , <EOS> and i don't think it's take more than four weeks time . <EOS> or uh <EOS> okay , so then the real production we will start once we product evaluation , okay , <EOS> then uh it's approve from uh the technical team and uh your team , okay , uh from the management , then we can launch in the market . <EOS> hm ? <EOS>
let's see if i can get this bloody thing to work . <EOS> whoops . <EOS> uh maybe we should start cleaning up the clay . <EOS> yeah , maybe . <EOS> so <EOS> does it go back in , does it ? <EOS> reusable . <EOS> something we should get . <EOS>
yeah wood . <EOS> no . <EOS> oh what did you <EOS> oh sorry , <EOS> go ahead . <EOS> well , titanium s <EOS> i was saying that titanium , if we're being restricted then i would probably lean away from that . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> 'cause if it's gonna cost us more to produce a chip , titanium will be more expensive . <EOS>
that's not bad . <EOS> yep . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> but anyhow , still we are under control , okay , <EOS> so what uh i will do is i will try to negotiate with the vendors , okay , to get uh the production cost less , okay , <EOS> so then we can save some money , okay , to put into th our marketing or uh you know the promotions , whatever , okay , <EOS> so that uh i will look after . <EOS> i will speak to the management and how to get uh you know some more uh cost down . <EOS>
uh three . <EOS> two . <EOS> two . <EOS> two . <EOS> okay . um , one point three ? <EOS> one . <EOS> one . <EOS> one . <EOS> ha . <EOS> two point one ? <EOS> uh two . <EOS> two . <EOS> uh two . <EOS> two point i think i missed two . <EOS> wait , is that two point one ? <EOS>
yes . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> well <EOS> the the general like most older remotes are flat , just straight . <EOS> and uh our d manufacturing department can also deliver single curved or double curved ca curved cases . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> and what would single curved and double curved mean ? <EOS>
huh . <EOS> like spaceship . <EOS> right . um little homing device . um . <EOS> okay . <EOS> so what do we think this remote control should <EOS> five minutes . <EOS> oh dear . till the meeting oh right . <EOS> this is what we have left . <EOS>
hmm . <EOS> uh <EOS> i'm not sure whether the sort of having people have a booklet <EOS> 'cause one the second most annoying thing that people found was having to learn the new one . <EOS> so maybe next to each of the buttons , you know each of them could have a number and then also a function written next to it , <EOS> so you're basically pressing <EOS>
then um a surprisingly great deal of people w indicated that um an l_c_d_ screen in the remote control would be preferred . <EOS> this was um mostly people in the age of sixteen to twenty five . <EOS> but up till forty five it remains feasible . <EOS> this would also greatly increase the production costs <EOS> but i think these are just some small factors we could consider . <EOS>
oh yeah , everybody . <EOS> okay . <EOS> anyway , so that is definitely at work . <EOS> mine is amber . <EOS> oh . <EOS> not me . <EOS> i didn't have a phone 'til university . <EOS> but the my <EOS> but my one issue is just like the whole it's for t_v_ only . <EOS> i was like who's gonna buy a remote just for the t_v_ unless they've lost theirs . <EOS>
well <EOS> yeah . <EOS> we we're not lacking in ideas , <EOS> you know <EOS> it's <EOS> that was not the problem . <EOS> unti uh uh until uh until accounts came along , <EOS> squish . <EOS> we're burs bursting with creativity . <EOS> yeah <EOS> i think of in the end , ideas that can be used sadly . <EOS> not so much that we weren't full of ideas , but of ones that are gonna allow us to actually build the thing . <EOS> it's a bit of a pity . <EOS> um i would have to agree on that . <EOS> i think we needed a larger budget . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> it doesn't seem that you would need anything besides pow <EOS> i mean and the power button could even be like hold down the menu button for like longer than one second and it turns on the t_v_ . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so can we imagine that this would be smaller than the remote controls that you showed us before . <EOS> i mean <EOS> okay . <EOS>
yeah that's in the functional design uh folder . <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah . yeah that's just basically what i just showed . <EOS> but where do you did you get the newsflash ? <EOS> yeah . yeah i got it by <EOS> yeah . <EOS> you're the only one uh okay . <EOS>
um rubber indeed ? <EOS> yeah , <EOS> bu what <EOS> oh , <EOS> but we have curves like it and it . <EOS> there are two curves , <EOS> right ? <EOS> oh , okay i understand , i understand . <EOS> rubber . <EOS> thirteen ? <EOS> huh ? <EOS>
um well , i think the buttons are still mm kind of the most um easy for the user to use , <EOS> i mean um what other options would you have ? <EOS> a little screen or something , <EOS> but this would be really kind of i think a lot of learning for the user <EOS> and and i mean the user just wants to get um get a result um quickly , <EOS> not to spend time in like um giving several orders um i dunno . <EOS> i think i th i would i would think the put the buttons , <EOS> but if if you have other mm proposals um . <EOS>
uh mayb for me it's <EOS> if i use my telephone , i never use those buttons to to to call <EOS> sh <EOS> never . <EOS> well <EOS> i <EOS> mm as as hard as never ? <EOS> oh . <EOS> no , neither do i . oh are you ? <EOS>
and so just to <EOS> just to clarify by speech recognition you mean they would say , channel five , and the thing would go to channel five ? <EOS> i guess so , yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> to just say , where are you , and thing beeps , you know . <EOS>
i don't think it would really work . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> it's a <EOS> yeah , <EOS> you really need buttons for changing a channel . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> th it'd be <EOS> it'd be handy for going through <EOS> if there was an on-screen menu of your channel choices , than you can scroll down on the scroll . <EOS>
it's enough . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> i mean we could have <EOS> well , i guess you need an on and off switch , <EOS> but you could you could o you could turn it turn it on by taking the top off the banana maybe , you know , <EOS> it's kind of like a spy kind of flick thing . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> the the arrow functions . yeah . yeah . <EOS> the th <EOS> exactly . <EOS> oh . this is hard . <EOS> what do <EOS> don't have to draw it exactly do we ? <EOS> no it's it's uh it's okay . <EOS> wait . <EOS> let me try it one more time . <EOS> maybe i've uh it's easier if i draw it in once . <EOS> okay , of course it will become way more ugly . <EOS>
this ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> uh pretty accurate . <EOS> oh we skip this i guess . sound button press . <EOS> yep . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> you can also include it . <EOS> it's not much work . <EOS> light only button user ca user interaction . <EOS>
yes . it does . <EOS> 'kay . <EOS> so <EOS> i guess that , is that , is that about it ? <EOS> so we have a good idea of what we're gonna need to to do on this ? <EOS> right . <EOS> um okay so we will have another meeting in thirty minutes . um <EOS> here's what's gonna be going on . um <EOS> um ryan you'll be working on the user interface design . um <EOS> manuel you'll be working on the look-and-feel design . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> i think , i've saved mine already . <EOS> yeah , can you save that uh send that last one again , please , raj , <EOS> as i still can't find it on the <EOS> yeah . <EOS> uh it was under a different name . <EOS> i will show you , <EOS> in shared documents . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> e excuse me <EOS> i forgot my <EOS> alright , okay , yeah . <EOS> copy . <EOS> he's gonna get his pen . <EOS> oh right . okay . <EOS> um will you guys first with your prototype um before we get to the good news ? <EOS>
mm okay . <EOS> combined with uh decrease the or <EOS> take out the limited functio functions <EOS> that we don't really use much . <EOS> alright take out teletext , <EOS> but as for channel settings and stuff it might it might um turn people somewhe peop some people that want the whole functionality away . <EOS> but , since if we're marketing a more kind of fashionable approach then it'd it would be fashion and fashion over practicality . <EOS>
you can hear it's under the couch yeah . <EOS> um , <EOS> so i yeah . <EOS> so need the other buttons . <EOS> so we have this mm . <EOS> so i mean the two remotes that you had shown r <EOS> i don't remember who showed them , <EOS> yeah you you did um , <EOS> they're <EOS> i mean one looked like it was for v_c_r_ type thing , and the other looked like just television . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> stam . <EOS> basic basic television uh interface . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so , uh <EOS> i think we should now all go work uh uh at this <EOS> and uh you will be informed via email and other kind of communication . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
tomato ? what tomato ? <EOS> i don't recall a tomato . <EOS> look . <EOS> oh yeah , well yeah , we had v some red left over . <EOS> so . okay , <EOS> so this is the um non to non uh no buttons one , <EOS> or as mm few buttons as possible , <EOS> mainly speak recognition . <EOS> the yellow there is the um <EOS> the slogan , yeah , <EOS> that we need to incorporate , <EOS> it's very simple . <EOS> if you do need buttons , you can flip it over , and there's some there , <EOS> um but mainly it's speech recognition . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> then again i guess the th where it was most popular was the fifteen to twenty five bracket <EOS> and the i don't know how often they're buying televisions . <EOS> right , <EOS> and <EOS> right . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> right . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yes , <EOS> which it is cheaper in the long run as well . <EOS> um , th the shape you got trendy . <EOS> i don't wanna big box with lots of things , <EOS> you don't want a tiny sort of little thing either , <EOS> because then you have got the repetitive strain injury no matter how many how much you try and make it simple , <EOS> um <EOS>
mm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> that's right . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> different colours . <EOS> yes . <EOS> you can make a banana shaped one . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> do we look at one target group ? <EOS> and with the twenty five euros you know can we can we afford to have <EOS> uh i'm asking the technical people here whether um to look at sort of subgroups with maybe different buttons for each group <EOS> how much would that throw us out of the cost we are supposed to <EOS> respect ? <EOS>
yeah . yeah definitely . <EOS> like , i think we're looking at something that could be , like like even maybe like a cir i'm f i'm seeing almost like a circular sort of like handheld like thing . <EOS> i mean it it needs to be easy to <EOS> somehow it needs to be easy to like manipulate <EOS> and use your <EOS>
okay . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> quite um there's quite a few design restrictions that they've got on the shape of the case . <EOS> if you go for titanium they can only do a standard box shape , <EOS> whereas if you come to plastic they can they can be a little more they can they can do sort of curved shapes . <EOS> but whether whether or not <EOS> because we'd have it in two separate units <EOS>
you think ? <EOS> and you could you could sell oils with it , to take care of it . <EOS> no y no no no , <EOS> the o the only w the only wood you can use are the ones that are hard , extremely hard wood , <EOS> but there are some very pretty woods out there . <EOS>
mm , yeah , i've seen them . <EOS> um . well <EOS> the other option of course is that um the <EOS> well <EOS> i was going to say clapping , um <EOS> the clapping one . <EOS> um digital telephones , uh for example , one unit has <EOS> of course you have to have that base unit , <EOS> somewhere where there's a button , <EOS> but maybe it's a button that you attach to the t_v_ . <EOS> something which you when you press that , it would beep to give its location away , on the remote unit . <EOS> and that could be something could um separate us a bit . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> uh the case materials . <EOS> well we have all kinds of hard uh materials like the the hard plastic , the wood and the titanium . <EOS> i would definitely go for rubber <EOS> 'cause it fits most in what people wanna see nowadays . <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
and and it's a you know , for the the cowboy in all of us <EOS> i i'm not quite sure what the the function is there but <EOS> right okay . <EOS> well i like that design . <EOS> yeah it's a g i mean you could have a you know a <EOS>
yep . <EOS> i think another point is that the meetings um are more brainstorming sessions than meetings , <EOS> so time is also a very s um strong factor , and structure . <EOS> because for a brainstorming meeting you want a structure that allows you to allows ideas to get tossed , um to be evaluated , and to be reviewed , and to get feedback and come back . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> right . <EOS> mm . <EOS> ooh , that's a bit difficult to see . <EOS> mm k <EOS> if you explain it to us it'll be fine . <EOS> okay , well , i can send it to all of you . <EOS> what it is is um it's cones , <EOS> 'cause i thought they'd be more exciting . <EOS> um but <EOS> ooh where's it go ? <EOS>
scroll . <EOS> by just putting the volume on the side . <EOS> and and just channel buttons here . <EOS> and the channels as well . <EOS> oh <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> or uh maybe uh <EOS> the channel buttons are often used . <EOS> and you can't use them now with your thumb , <EOS> because the thing is not , it's not easy to control . <EOS>
so <EOS> we have uh a new uh age of forty plus . <EOS> but y but you but you already said that the uh company was about uh forty plus uh clients ? <EOS> people . <EOS> so <EOS> yeah , <EOS> so we just can skip the l_c_d_ r on the remote control , <EOS> because <EOS>
yeah but the components inside . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> very too expensive to do . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> and i mean you could also , you can have just a very thin veneer of wood as well . <EOS> and also uh <EOS> yeah but it's more easier to do a banana in plastic than uh in wood . <EOS>
elegant . <EOS> elegant . <EOS> elegant . <EOS> elegant , i don't know if i'd call them elegant . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> no <EOS> these aren't the exact terms that the um <EOS> like stylish or aesthetic . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> stylish , yeah . <EOS> elegant . we're gon let's use elegant , <EOS> although the the the people , the word on the street is is <EOS>
yeah , definitely . <EOS> you weren't like a a dictating leader , so that was always good . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> you have to say that , <EOS> 'cause i'm taking the notes . <EOS> i'll leave the room and you can have another go . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> okay , <EOS> so technically how the problems that how to do it is to how to get the content . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> challenge . <EOS> i think i it's not very difficult to to browse by channel <EOS> but it's a little bit tricky to browse by contents so <EOS>
no . <EOS> yeah . s <EOS> hmm . <EOS> uh-huh . <EOS> but uh price price not withstanding um , is it too complicated , is it gonna be too much just overload ? <EOS> twelve fifty . <EOS> and the <EOS> uh i it will be easy because there will be , on l_c_d_ s screen , there will be different frent icons , they can just click ok okay , whatever they wa <EOS>
uh to be to be quick <EOS> there's a lot of words here <EOS> but uh basically there are uh in in the market of of remote controls there are three aspects that we should very pay much attention to . <EOS> the first one , which seems to be the most important one , is that it has to be fancy , it has to have a fancy look and feel . <EOS> and uh interestingly this is the very most important thing . it has to be fancy . <EOS> strangely enough it's more important to be fancy than to be wi and now that's the second thing it has to be , it has to be technologically i innovative , <EOS> it has to be new with some of uh new uh technology inside <EOS> and uh and this is also uh more important than the last thing <EOS> which we w may think that would have been the most important , <EOS> which is that it should be easy to use and it should be easy to use as a remote control . <EOS> so as you see uh it first have to be very nice , <EOS> s something that people are proud of <EOS> uh uh that i uh they can be id identified with <EOS> uh and and then uh something that um contains very novel stuff <EOS> that they can talk about with their friends , huh , mine has this and not yours . <EOS>
no , <EOS> just everything . <EOS> okay . <EOS> . so yeah , <EOS> what what what's a remote control , <EOS> it's just a black thing with some buttons on it , <EOS> it's not nothing very special , <EOS> but um <EOS> yeah , that's right . <EOS>
what ? <EOS> how do i i escape this s uh presentation ? <EOS> uh left . <EOS> so <EOS> uh <EOS> ah okay . <EOS> and show , <EOS> sorry . <EOS> okay , so <EOS> let's have a look s at this one . <EOS> just <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
mm it's impressing . <EOS> so let me get it , <EOS> if i press this button <EOS> wicked isn't it ? <EOS> i see . that's pretty cool . <EOS> hang on . <EOS> so you can take this ho take this home with you tonight and you can push that and he'll be across town <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> that's alright , that always irritates me anyway , yeah . <EOS> not that you can do that on the board , either . <EOS> we could make some little <EOS> but yeah , but i mean already just just preparing the slides before before the meeting , yeah . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> the , i mean just like the more advanced it is , <EOS> yeah . <EOS> the better it'll sell . <EOS> i i thought offering some of those options for different materials that it could be made of different , you know <EOS> i think we'd have to decide on the power options , maybe . <EOS> so that we could reduce cost . <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
you should you should have a black one <EOS> because uh i think black is standard . <EOS> black . yeah , black i think is is the standard . <EOS> black ? <EOS> with the with the yellow uh <EOS> but if you want to be different , then uh <EOS>
it's like if you're holding it <EOS> yeah . it's okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> next slide ? <EOS> yes . <EOS> and so personally i think that we need a modern eye-catching design , <EOS> but it it really needs to be simple . <EOS> so saying from y your slide , your presentation , the engineering versus the user-specified remotes , <EOS> i think that we should go with something that's more user-friendly . <EOS> where the engineering ones , the boxes , tend to make it look more complicated than it really is . <EOS> um the functionality of the product really needs to be considered as to like what type of buttons do we really need on it . <EOS>
mm-hmm . pens <EOS> in fact i've just called up that table there , we asked those two questions , <EOS> the table relates to both questions , so we didn't differentiate . <EOS> would you prefer an l_c_d_ screen , that's multi-function remote <EOS> and would you pay more for speech recognition in a remote control ? <EOS> so you can see how the the yes no sort of varies across the age group there , <EOS> and a substantial number of don't knows in the older age group , <EOS> i think that's just general fear of new technology . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> i yeah . <EOS> dude , i think we've had internet for like eighteen years . <EOS> true . <EOS> no <EOS> we have but i not in the sense that it's so un you know uh ubiquitous <EOS> i yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> but it's not regular <EOS> i mean my grandparents had it in the eighties <EOS> and i got it in ninety four , <EOS> but still . <EOS>
tarik rahman . t_a_r_i_k_ . <EOS> t_ r_ i_ k_ . <EOS> and your role in this is ? <EOS> industrial designer . <EOS> industrial designer . <EOS> and , lastly we have ? <EOS> uh , dave cochrane . <EOS> and you're going to be the user interface , <EOS> is it ? <EOS> designer . okay . <EOS>
it could be <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> but rubber comes coloured , doesn't it ? you know . <EOS> rub rubber comes coloured , <EOS> it's i would <EOS> maybe it's like if you want titanium coloured or wood coloured , it's different . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> or maybe maybe if you want some kind of pattern thing on it , <EOS> yeah yeah , okay . <EOS>
so mm . <EOS> maybe y y you cannot put this webpage online on the <EOS> uh i should be able to actually , if i email it to you now . <EOS> you can disconnect it there <EOS> no ? <EOS> you can maybe just just <EOS> ah <EOS> it's it <EOS> okay <EOS> it's a webpage on the c_ it's a file <EOS> okay . <EOS> o otherwise you yeah .
no , <EOS> it's weird . <EOS> station page . <EOS> huh , <EOS> looks fucking boring now . <EOS> what did you think about uh the process ? <EOS> how satisfied are we ? <EOS> deadlines were sometimes very short . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> bu but stressful . <EOS> you think , no , my presentation isn't ready . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> is usually , i've found , an infra-red device which sends a signal to the actual television . um and the last part is receiver which is important in the system <EOS> but is not actually part of the remote itself , <EOS> because that's obviously found in the television . <EOS> . <EOS> um i'm gonna have to actually draw on the board <EOS> because uh it was a little tricky on powerpoint to get this working , <EOS> so . i'll just go through there . <EOS> s um um do we have a cloth to wipe this down with , or ? <EOS> oh i'll j <EOS>
yes . okay . <EOS> more that uh kind of style . <EOS> and a bit uh <EOS> not not the old grey black <EOS> uh yeah . <EOS> some some kind of bling bling uh mm can we have <EOS> where you can put a ve uh we have <EOS> if we do it like that we have below have we uh a lot of room to put a nice logo . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay , th then <EOS> okay then for the next time , um try to come up either with your own preferences , <EOS> that's quite easy probably to state now that you know the constraints , <EOS> or if you can poll a little bit the people around you , <EOS> that would be i mean , even <EOS>
then you just bring it up to your mouth <EOS> and just speak to it , <EOS> yeah , yeah . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> and just say <EOS> yeah , <EOS> maybe we cou <EOS> like <EOS> w <EOS> like <EOS> we're leaving out the buttons for the the f less frequently used stuff , <EOS> but maybe we could incorporate that into the voice . <EOS>
i know . i know . <EOS> oh it should be interesting . <EOS> wait until i tell them i'm not coming back . <EOS> uh-huh . <EOS> um <EOS> let's see . <EOS> right <EOS> you s you're gonna stay here ? <EOS> they're gonna love that one . <EOS> probably . <EOS> or at least get a work visa for a while <EOS> and then decide . <EOS>
um criteria six . <EOS> r_s_i_ is it good against ? <EOS> yes . very good . <EOS> it's one . <EOS> and criteria seven , which is the last one , <EOS> does it get lost ? <EOS> is it easy to get lost ? <EOS> yes s yeah . <EOS>
okay um , <EOS> moving on to slightly more serious stuff . <EOS> we're gonna talk about project finances . <EOS> um we have a couple <EOS> we'd like to sell it for about twenty five euro with the profit aim of um fifteen million euro um from our sales <EOS> and because this is such this is for television it's a we have a market range of internet , like it's an international market range , <EOS> we don't have to worry about specifics . <EOS> um in order to make a profit of this magnitude , we need to um be able to produce each one at a maximum of twelve fifty euro . <EOS> so we're selling it for twice what we'd like to produce it for . <EOS>
then you'd have to have an off te off key . <EOS> okay , yep , mm-hmm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> it's not getting a bit complicated ? <EOS> could granny do this , <EOS> or are we just not aiming at granny ? <EOS> well <EOS> or y <EOS> yeah . <EOS> or something that has a a turning dial , where at the far end is on or off . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> i don't <EOS> um i wish . <EOS> anyway , uh <EOS> that was the only comment about um some of the the decisions
yeah . <EOS> well <EOS> the <EOS> the locator's gonna require a radio transmitter , <EOS> which will <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> that's gonna n is that gonna need a better chip as well ? <EOS> um we're probably gonna have to go with a like a medium chip , s i would imagine . <EOS>
i think it's okay . <EOS> so you cannot see them . <EOS> well , you you will get used to it . <EOS> and moreover , th the button ar are lighted so you you immediately identify the right side , because you have light on buttons . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so the buttons have to be here and the wheel has to be <EOS> y <EOS> yeah i know , <EOS> but uh if you hold with your left hand , and the wheel is here , and the buttons are here , then when you turn it around the buttons will be on the other side . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> oh man . <EOS> so uh <EOS> here we have our detailed design meeting <EOS> where we will um look at the prototype <EOS> and <EOS> um right so um , <EOS> i finally figured out what this whole second bullet point is about in my <EOS> that my coach was sending to me . <EOS> it means i'm supposed to read the minutes from the previous meeting . <EOS>
yeah , teenagers and young professionals . <EOS> well that's for speech recognition . <EOS> oh . <EOS> well <EOS> oh , uh . <EOS> and screen . <EOS> that's only for speech recognition and screen . <EOS> i was thinking about that <EOS> but uh i mean speech recognition is really hard to programme , <EOS> and also , if the t_v_ is on it's making sound and the people on the t_v_ are talking , and if somebody says like one , then the t_v_'s gonna switch itself to channel one , <EOS> or <EOS> it seems like a silly , <EOS> i'm not sure how you would implement it . <EOS>
ah okay . <EOS> yes , <EOS> i'll just get this up . <EOS> so that we don't <EOS> do we not need any button on the remote control <EOS> it would be all based on speech . <EOS> okay . <EOS> well <EOS> potentially yeah , um <EOS> i think even for interesti <EOS> yeah <EOS> i think that would not work so well . <EOS> you wanna have both options . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> colourful , maybe <EOS> colourful , yeah mm . <EOS> colourful ? that's not practical . <EOS> colourful , because uh nobody has colourful remote control <EOS> , they're always black , yeah , <EOS> but this one could be i dunno , purple or b <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
which is cheaper . <EOS> well i don't know if it's cheaper actually . <EOS> oh . mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> oh i like that shape . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i was thinking sort of a single ball shape . <EOS> so you're holding a squishy ball <EOS> and then it has a <EOS>
mm mm . <EOS> you know 'cause that'd be in the palm of their hand and they wouldn't be able to see it , <EOS> unless you have sort of you got the buttons options on one side , and you get the facia on the other side with a microphone so that you can place it face down . <EOS>
yes . <EOS> i think <EOS> i think we will have to look at the budget on that <EOS> but i think in principle that that would be that would be kind of fun , you know . <EOS> yeah that will be <EOS> yeah yeah . <EOS> because we had something sort of sexy for adults and we could have something sort of <EOS> silly for children <EOS> or a little animal shape or in a or a little elephant so they can remember where it is . <EOS>
okay . you need the little thingy . <EOS> ooh . <EOS> how do i um <EOS> s <EOS> that's on view . <EOS> oh . <EOS> right . <EOS> okay so this is on the working design , which is sort of the uh mechanical functions of the remote , <EOS> um and the method i used was to basically look at existing designs and incorporate ideas from our last meeting . <EOS>
yeah , yeah . <EOS> yes , okay . <EOS> i would say two , three . <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so , <EOS> consensus ? <EOS> two or three ? <EOS> two ? <EOS> two ? <EOS> mm . two's good <EOS> yes . <EOS> yep . <EOS>
um . <EOS> mm . <EOS> manufacturing <EOS> and uh you know , if we have a high tech interior , then then that that sh may well be cost effective . <EOS> do they make batteries that last that long ? <EOS> i mean <EOS> th th <EOS> certainly . <EOS> um i can't think of anything off the s top of my head , <EOS> but there are certainly things that you buy . i mean calculators for example . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> we <EOS> we could yeah . <EOS> but i think that uh that collides with our mission to make it very cheap . <EOS> because l_c_d_ screens are very expensive . <EOS> a touch screen uh probably uh even more . <EOS>
the conceptual or <EOS> ah . because i see only my own presentation <EOS> yeah . <EOS> no no no , <EOS> can you go back one ? <EOS> uh 'cause it has to be powerpoint pre <EOS> yeah components design , that's it . <EOS> this ? <EOS> i'll just put it in there . <EOS>
celebration . <EOS> over and the meantime let's celebrate . <EOS> so let's meet up uh this evening to hang up for some party . <EOS> sounds good . <EOS> thank you . <EOS> nice working with you . <EOS> 's good . <EOS> very good . <EOS> okay . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> fee selling . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yes . <EOS> um so they'll be our main selling points . <EOS> so um <EOS> th those have been fulfilled by your prototype <EOS> and go ahead to the next slide please . <EOS> okay , so um the shape um i think is a a one . <EOS> that's really , really excellent shape . <EOS> the size is small um <EOS> and th these points are in the importance for the , for the marketing , these aren't i in how i feel . <EOS> i think that it's <EOS> i think that it's plenty small enough to sell <EOS> but i think we're sort of right <EOS> the scale is one to seven . <EOS> i think we're sort of right in the middle as far as c other competitors . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> but that would p that would probably be quite expensive . <EOS> but how do we know how much uh , <EOS> i mean , how much do we have per how much ? <EOS> twelve fifty . <EOS> twelve fifty . <EOS> it g can't be more than twelve fifty per unit . <EOS>
it's um <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> d you've got the <EOS> although i'd be curious to see how many uh <EOS> you know , there are some colours that i wouldn i would never choose , and i would be curious how many people choose that colour . <EOS>
you could change the vegetable , or fruit . <EOS> oh is that broccoli ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> this is a mango . <EOS> the <EOS> it's trendy fruit , it's not just ordinary fruits . <EOS> you don't have orange , you have mango . <EOS> um i guess strawberry's not as trendy , but <EOS>
okay . <EOS> okay , <EOS> yeah , tha that's true , <EOS> with the price range we're looking at , going for a touch screen would probably be possibly out of our <EOS> yeah . <EOS> but you think uh again something to control multiple units in uh a simple fashion . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> and and <EOS> yeah , <EOS> and also if if you have a good speech uh speech recognition , you can just throw the uh <EOS> yeah . i think so . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> a uh someone says that uh give me one coke , and the t_v_ turns uh to one . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> it's not uh <EOS>
if y <EOS> okay , can you continue , please mi ? <EOS> so , but <EOS> yep . <EOS> um okay , so , i think um one of the really kind of useful things you can do with with internet connectivity would be to have this a programme driven interface rather than the channel number . <EOS> so if we can have a higher priced uh remote control i think that would really be worth uh something that would be worth implementing . <EOS>
i mean <EOS> oh yeah . <EOS> some uh k esk uh yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah but but that's optional for later i guess . <EOS> i mean , we have to make <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah but we have hardware inside , which is so it has to have some sort of basic shape . <EOS>
would the sort of spongy and the the plasticky thing <EOS> y you can get those mobile phones that initially have a it is plastic but then they have sort of a a s a cover on it which is just sort of soft and stuff . <EOS> so i don't know if that would still be possible to have you know in plastic . <EOS> but then where do people hold it ? <EOS> just all be sort of spongy . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> innovative . mm . <EOS> how do we make it look cool is the question . <EOS> cool , fancy ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> we have to make it l look like a fruit or vegetable . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm . <EOS> maybe uh um a colour that remember some fruit uh , things like that . <EOS>
um , <EOS> in terms of comments on this or in terms of my own <EOS> yes , in t yes , in term in terms of comments first <EOS> in turns of wow . <EOS> she works in the cubicle next to me so she's uh she was already a little bit prepared for this . <EOS> luckily ed was not . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> it's true huh ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i mean <EOS> i think had the issue been more serious we probably woulda brainstormed more during our meetings as a team . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> that's true . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> course i'm i'm conscious of the idea of the project manager asking if you guys feel like there's a team you know it's like , kind of like , like hmm . <EOS> it d <EOS>
uh each stage is uh uh is broken up in two uh two stages , individual work and a meeting . <EOS> so it's uh it's very straightforward . <EOS> okay , <EOS> the tool training . <EOS> we have two smart boards . <EOS> this one is for the presentations , the powerpoint presentations or the word presentation of whatever you uh you had . <EOS> uh and this is uh only for uh drawing . <EOS> so uh <EOS> we uh must let it uh stand on this uh this programme . <EOS> this is called a smart board <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> but then maybe that's looking at someone who's just sitting on their own rather than <EOS> yeah . <EOS> the eternal battle for control of the controls . <EOS> it's not something that's come up in any of our uh focus groups and market research , <EOS> it's not a thing that people are looking for <EOS>
are we doing the the speech recognition ? <EOS> because we didn't have enough time to uh de um design the inside as well . <EOS> okay , but it's still possible uh uh financially . <EOS> so if you want to , it's okay . <EOS> okay yeah . well then then we're gonna put it in . <EOS>
so if there's a button for each type . <EOS> no <EOS> because you wanna be able to go up and down through the channels . <EOS> yeah people are gonna have their favourite sorta , whether they do that or whether they <EOS> ah-ha okay . <EOS> okay , okay , <EOS> well then you just have , you have a diff you have a mode switch . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> which can be recognised by as voice recogniser in the television , <EOS> for example , if you want to see we if you want to see the ninth channel if you say just say ninth channel , uh th now the the uh yeah , the remote will automatically it will switch to the ninth channel . <EOS> so the t_v_ will have some recogniser which will recognise the user's voice and accordingly it will change its functionalities . <EOS> so this is one of the very important feature a remote control can have . <EOS>
for remote control , a favourite for your text . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> no , for the prototype . new ideas . <EOS> yeah , but still , you couldn't make a fancy a f you couldn't make a a prototype out of this . because we don't have any sizes and <EOS>
yeah . okay . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> is it possible to store this on the share documents or what <EOS> yeah , me too . <EOS> uh ye well <EOS> save as . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> because uh all uh things are uh stored in smart board dot uh x_d_k_ <EOS> and that's in <EOS>
and how do we <EOS> i feel like a ye i feel like a yellow one would be too garish . <EOS> r_ the double r_ . <EOS> we could just have the logo in yellow , <EOS> or maybe a yellow light for the keys . <EOS> can't make it entirely <EOS>
okay . yep . <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> right , is there <EOS> so do we need to decide on the functions now ? s <EOS> i would guess so . <EOS> well i think it'd be really easy and it'd be a big advantage if we did have some sort of um kind of whistle back kind of function . <EOS> 'cause that'll solve kind of the frustration of losing it . <EOS>
no one would would be interested . <EOS> so <EOS> i think it would be better not to do any intelligent controller <EOS> and to stay with the google controller or a fancy controller . <EOS> maybe try to mix the google controller and the fancy controller ? <EOS> hmm ? <EOS>
or keep that ? <EOS> it's okay . <EOS> but you'd definitely need a <EOS> s <EOS> uh yeah , <EOS> i don't know . <EOS> yeah , i think so . <EOS> and we we have to build in a microphone <EOS> and <EOS> well uh <EOS> then it w <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> does anyone know if v_c_r_s are the same across international ? <EOS> they're not no . <EOS> they're not , no . <EOS> okay , so you'd need like a whole different set of buttons for everybody's v_c_r_s . <EOS> s <EOS> yeah , that's right , yeah . <EOS> but d_v_d_ probably is . <EOS>
yeah , th thank you . <EOS> yeah , quite . <EOS> and we're using this our basic chip set , <EOS> so it's all good . <EOS> oh sorry . <EOS> are we done with our meeting ? <EOS> uh excuse me , brian . <EOS> you have to keep your pen separate , because i used your pen . <EOS>
in four diff <EOS> in in four meetings . <EOS> funny , all designer meetings could be this quick . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> you know , maybe this isn't a simulation , <EOS> maybe this is actually so it's like sony or someone like that they're they're just , yeah , they get <EOS>
okay . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> there are disadvantages , <EOS> an an l_c_d_ display would have to be quite small , <EOS> 'cause we're we're i <EOS> well <EOS> we're <EOS> i assume we're gonna be making quite a small device . <EOS> um it would also have to have uh a kind of backlighting in it , <EOS> 'cause you ten you tend to watch t_v_ in the dark , <EOS> but you need to be able to see your l_d_d_ l_c_d_ display . <EOS>
yep . for y for you your designing , you're not you won't be uh <EOS> you won't had um buttons to just to manipulate yeah to control the recorder or maybe the garage door or things like that . <EOS> it's <EOS> because if we want to <EOS> control . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> so well we're under the the the cost . <EOS> so we can go to through to project evaluation . <EOS> okay so now we have a product which nobody would would buy . <EOS> would yeah , would buy . <EOS> sorry ? <EOS> no we have a product which none of us would buy . <EOS>
for the cheap price we have , for the cheap price we want to <EOS> true . <EOS> so you mean that infrared control is a cheap technology ? <EOS> i think it's cheaper than laser , so . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> do y you know the requirements for the remote control ? <EOS>
intro <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> that's the problem . that's the main problem . <EOS> well , <EOS> i got f also an email from <EOS> so <EOS> the the technology department . <EOS> maybe we watch the first uh the next two presentations . <EOS> they have done uh research about it , <EOS> and uh even more possibilities now with speech . <EOS> so they recommended using it . <EOS> well <EOS>
yeah , yeah . <EOS> uh . <EOS> s that's coming . <EOS> uh <EOS> okay . great . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yep . <EOS> okay so yeah i will i will give a brief outline about what i what i prepared for this meeting . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS>
the standards . <EOS> so it's a good start for us . <EOS> that's great . thank you sarah . <EOS> right . so um <EOS> yep <EOS> i'll just uh switch that back here . <EOS> i'll finish up with just a bit of discussion plan on for the next phase . <EOS>
six . five or six . <EOS> what are we doing ? <EOS> no <EOS> sorry , sorry , sorry , sorry , <EOS> we are doing a very wrong thing . <EOS> yeah , yeah , we are taking everything , <EOS> and that's <EOS> i have taken it very wrongly . <EOS> yeah uh <EOS> three four four two six seven seven sev <EOS> yeah one pe exactly . <EOS> so we can say one or two . <EOS> because it is one point eight uh two , so we will do two . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so where were the trends . <EOS>
so <EOS> then , yes . <EOS> but if you want to look at the screen , no . <EOS> well <EOS> yeah , and <EOS> i think this is not good . <EOS> the screen has to be square ? <EOS> or it can be like a a shape , quite , uh with curves . <EOS>
uh yeah . <EOS> the doesn't . <EOS> . <EOS> yeah , this ? <EOS> no ? <EOS> yeah . something like that . <EOS> okay , <EOS> just uh in the middle the general functions , like play , uh channel switching , <EOS> and then uh at the top or at the bottom , some menus like uh settings or that you can drop down . <EOS>
though i think that's what people would pay for , <EOS> i mean if you're gonna pay for an expensive high class remote , you're gonna expect it to do something <EOS> that's true , <EOS> i mean <EOS> it is the new <EOS> it would be in a class of its own . <EOS>
a smaller s <EOS> yeah okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> so , five by s ten . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> um so what about , so the case we talked about . <EOS> um something easy to use , <EOS> you said something easy to use but how does that fit in a fashion way , like with fruit and vegetable , <EOS> and about the colour and logo of the of the company and so on , now , can we do that ? <EOS> my first idea is because our colour is more yellow , and the it should be easy to take in a hand , i thought about banana , or something like that , which is fruits , and <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> uh the the shape is okay but <EOS> yeah ? <EOS> i don't see the the yeah why why we should use the the flipping uh mechanism . <EOS> because we <EOS> i thought it would be cool . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay yeah . it's it's for for for more trendy uh <EOS>
i know . <EOS> mm , i know . <EOS> mm . <EOS> it seemed like everything flowed pretty logically . you know from the the the basics to the conce <EOS> although the whole concepts thing , the whole concepts phase , i don't think i really understood like the concept . <EOS> well <EOS> the id <EOS> okay <EOS> the notion of <EOS> yeah i mean <EOS> i it's not like i have a concept of a mug's material , <EOS> it's just it is what it is . <EOS> you know , <EOS> maybe i rather than concepts i it should be th thought of we sh i i thought of i thought of <EOS> rather than in terms of concepts i thought of it in terms of um like proposed idea . <EOS>
and uh end with the conclusion of this project and see whether it fits with it fulf if it fulfil the requirement or not . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> so <EOS> d <EOS> let's start with the cost aspect <EOS> so so <EOS> i look at the aspect discussed last time , <EOS> that is to say uh to have a standard battery , <EOS> to have a yellow banana shaped uh case with uh a rubber material around it <EOS> to be <EOS> uh to feel spongy , <EOS>
so what , the wireless remote control ? <EOS> there's a wire with remote control ? <EOS> you'd <EOS> yes , you can . <EOS> it's so so bres <EOS> you have to decide how how you will you know , put some energy inside , <EOS> so <EOS> you can think about wireless <EOS> or you know <EOS> it's it's a question that we can raise , so . <EOS> we can think that you know , with the wire , you know , without a wire . <EOS> we can have both also . <EOS>
is this the joystick ? <EOS> th this part here is the joystick . <EOS> this would be the actual grip . <EOS> probably where you'd want to have the battery as well . <EOS> that would be probably the bulkiest part . <EOS> and you then have , at the uh at the bottom , the l_c_d_ , <EOS> and this would need to be articulated as well . <EOS> and basically i'd want this to rest here , right at the base of the wrist . <EOS> so it would fit just nicely in the hand . <EOS> and again , this part could be <EOS>
is this supposed to be clipped as well ? <EOS> i think so . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> it'll follow you <EOS> if you <EOS> yeah . there you go . <EOS> you can probably just stick it in your pocket for now , <EOS> i wouldn't worry too much . <EOS> should have good range . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> .. . <EOS> maybe just one button , <EOS> say the standby button is quite kinda separate from all the other functions . <EOS> maybe that could be a little apple . <EOS> maybe yeah . <EOS> and then that wouldn't get in the way of like kinda one to nine , <EOS> and it wouldn't confuse the numbers . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> i just don't know about that , because in order to do that in order to price it at that kind of level i think we'd need to have every functionality that all the other competitors are offering <EOS> like being able to operate , you know , the d_v_d_ player and , you know , the stereo system and all that . <EOS> which is a pretty basic function that w we've opted out of . <EOS> and additionally we're m maybe not supporting teletext um <EOS>
possibly . <EOS> that's right . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so how would this menu function work ? <EOS> would you maybe have like one menu button , then you'd use the other buttons , maybe the number buttons to actually do the separate functions . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> that would be a good idea , yeah . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> um you will receive some information by emails , i as usual . <EOS> thanks for coming today . <EOS> thanks . <EOS> okay . <EOS> alright . <EOS> thanks . <EOS>
right , mm-hmm . <EOS> yes , yes . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so it is <EOS> yeah , <EOS> yeah <EOS> shell . <EOS> yes , snail shell . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yes . <EOS> right . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> y yes <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> okay , so should we say two for that ? <EOS> yeah ? <EOS> sure . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> uh , question number five . <EOS> what's um <EOS> will people be willing to spend twenty five euros on this product ? <EOS> remember that eighty percent of users were willing to spend more money when a remote control looked fancy . <EOS>
yeah , tha that's so true . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> instead of uh just finding out what an icon means on a button . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah , uh <EOS> and you can navigate easier , <EOS> because wi with the you have to push the the the arrows and with a normal t_v_ uh remote . <EOS>
do we have an uh example of a good one ? <EOS> brilliant . <EOS> uh-huh . <EOS> well <EOS> yeah . um . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> well let's um <EOS> so w what are our definite decisions on this then as a team ? <EOS> the um <EOS> the the um the interface type we're going for <EOS>
i can move as far as <EOS> mm-hmm , y y you can move , uh . <EOS> maybe i take your chair ? <EOS> i <EOS> okay . <EOS> yes . you can you can sa take my chair . <EOS> it's a channel selection , a module , this and this function , <EOS> go to the . <EOS>
so <EOS> i i <EOS> everybody knows what whiteboard is <EOS> so we'll um uh we'll do a virtual drawing on the on on the whiteboard of of your your own uh uh favourite animal , <EOS> but le let's go round the table , <EOS> your favourite animal . <EOS>
hmm . <EOS> that's right . <EOS> no it it could be little d yeah it could be <EOS> well one one other thing that that speech recognition could really blow out the price for is uh when you want to sell into other markets , though , <EOS> because , i'm not sure exactly where we're gonna sell this , but i presume it's not gonna just be english speaking countries . <EOS> so then you have to s you know , you have to train models for <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> okay . <EOS> so that means that uh <EOS> so these are the sort of three um extra parameters that have been put on this uh project . <EOS> so we're being focused effectively directly at a television <EOS> and it seems to me that the management is uh wanting us to go down a narrow path and not opening out . <EOS> so anything that uh is to be added , such as voice recognition et cetera has to be very simple and has to be very quick <EOS> because time to market is is critical . s <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> colours th the elderly people <EOS> yeah , <EOS> i guess changing colours will be easier than changing uh <EOS> yeah . <EOS> changing just the shape of the uh remote control ? <EOS> the shape of it . <EOS> perhaps you could find something in the middle . <EOS> round but square . <EOS>
figure . <EOS> i'm not so good at drawing . <EOS> excuse me ? <EOS> well it's a good thing that the buttons aren't um , well that they are plastic , because then you can light up the light on when when they are usable . <EOS> yeah . yeah . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> oh yeah it is , yeah . oh yeah . <EOS> right . <EOS> everybody everybody ready ? <EOS> okay , let's have your um let's get have the uh presentation ? <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yep . <EOS> we've got some . <EOS> we've got a cool prototype . <EOS>
yes . <EOS> sure . <EOS> no , <EOS> it's two . the average is two . <EOS> it's good . yeah . <EOS> yeah . exactly . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> i uh uh i uh saved it . <EOS> and this <EOS> everything okay . <EOS> well , <EOS> the next part uh might be a little bit difficult to do in a group , <EOS> but i am willing to try it . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> but users tend to tend to want to use that <EOS> and once they lose out on the user experience they're like <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> uh but <EOS> because that's becomes the most accessible thing in front of <EOS> okay . <EOS> but that's not a bad thing is it ? <EOS> because when you think about it , the alternative is to go push the button . <EOS> jog dials are much easier than that . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> that was me . <EOS> yes . <EOS> energy ? <EOS> i mean we're gonna use batteries right ? <EOS> and <EOS> uh we actually had an option of batteries , solar power , and um a dynamo , <EOS> which is something i don't know what it is . <EOS> something to do with torches . <EOS>
h <EOS> i mean , <EOS> like i said before , <EOS> fifty per cent of of the fru f like frustration someone can have that was the biggest one <EOS> and half the people said that happened <EOS> and we all mentioned it before we knew about it . <EOS>
alright , <EOS> well <EOS> that's fine then . <EOS> okay . um and you'd mentioned i i was just gonna say , <EOS> could you reiterate the new project requirements , <EOS> because it they were <EOS> it has to be for a t_v_ , <EOS> just to keep myself <EOS>
yeah . yeah . <EOS> right . <EOS> lovely . <EOS> well , my favourite animal would be a monkey . <EOS> then they're small cute and furry , <EOS> and uh when planet of the apes becomes real , i'm gonna be up there with them . <EOS> right . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah , why should people buy this when they're already got a remote that came with the t_v_ ? <EOS> yep . <EOS> exactly . <EOS> um second , uh it should be technologically innovative innovative . <EOS> so <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> what's that mean ? <EOS>
uh-huh . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so it doesn't actually have buttons . <EOS> did you wanna see ? <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah no <EOS> you can carry on , <EOS> i just this is a model , <EOS> yeah . <EOS> look how it feels all . yes it really feels like like like a mobile phone . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> sounds good , mm-hmm . <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah . okay , cool . <EOS> okay . <EOS>
um <EOS> well i think we've all learnt stuff from each other , <EOS> like the n um <EOS> yeah . <EOS> just about each different . got new ideas from each other . <EOS> yeah . through discussion . <EOS> i'm not sure , new ideas found . <EOS> hmm ? <EOS>
oh gosh , <EOS> i've no idea . <EOS> g <EOS> just press the arrow keys i think . <EOS> usually goes to it . <EOS> okay . <EOS> sorry <EOS> i actually need <EOS> to see something else on my screen . <EOS> hit f_ eight again . <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
right as far as <EOS> i it's just uh the cost of an extra button . <EOS> i mean software-wise there's really no difference . <EOS> i think . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay . isn't <EOS> i have maybe a silly question . <EOS> i in the very beginning it said with the with the advent of computers there's gonna be the it's gonna be out-moded teletext . <EOS> i i don't understand how those two things are connected . <EOS> how does how does computers and teletext h how why is one eliminating the need of the other ? <EOS> i don't understand that . <EOS>
uh yes , if it is limited vocabulary usually it's enough . <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah we we can uh target , means we can target ninety five percent accuracy or somewhere ninety seven perc <EOS> well wh uh i imagine also that the microphone will be an ambiance um a um an ambience microphones <EOS> because you are not going to speak into into th into the remote control . <EOS> so it could be s a few centimetres . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> no . <EOS> but it's sort of like just taking aspects out of that and saying , well out of this one we like , you know the round section of um , b or we'd like the the button size on this . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> okay i think this is more a job to our <EOS> market person yeah . <EOS> so it should be the topic of maybe of the next meeting just to to have an overview of this and uh in which direction we should go . <EOS> marketing person . <EOS>
whose <EOS> about how if you have a bright colour you'll not lose it so much . <EOS> um and when the corporate colour is yellow , <EOS> i mean maybe we could think about about the colour of the whole product being yellow <EOS> i don't know . um <EOS>
aw , should be nice in your <EOS> why ? <EOS> no but it's really handy actually if you see . <EOS> it's it's so handy . <EOS> and then <EOS> it is handy , it's handy , but it it's terrible . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> it's kitsch . <EOS>
blah , i like it . <EOS> i like the idea , <EOS> but we're talking about in cost is gonna probably double . <EOS> it w it would increase the cost . <EOS> but boy , we can sell this thing , <EOS> because there's no batteries , <EOS> it's environmentally sensitive , <EOS> i we can identify it as a safer product in some form . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> um can we go back to <EOS> i'm gonna look really quickly back at those <EOS> two examples . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> examples <EOS> and see if there is anything . <EOS> which one is yours , technical functions <EOS> or functional requirement ? <EOS> okay . <EOS>
mm mm . <EOS> okay . <EOS> but the the problem is that uh is it robust to mishandling ? <EOS> we have <EOS> you should find a material that is robust at the same time spongy . <EOS> spongy . <EOS> a sponge . <EOS> yeah so uh so finally we have these three criterias . <EOS> one is fancy look , <EOS> second is innovative , <EOS> and third is easy to use . <EOS> so these are the f uh three criteria on which we are going to build our remote . <EOS> so and we have an evaluation criteria for each one of these , <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> mm . <EOS> it c <EOS> well <EOS> it <EOS> i can i can see technical problems with that in terms of the , you know , the sound from the television , <EOS> because if somebody actually on the television says uh uh , you know , i_t_v_ and you're watching b_b_c_ then then it might um change itself , <EOS> so it probably needs to be um possibly actually need a button on it <EOS>
and while you're doing that <EOS> we'll try and figure out how to hook these things on as well , <EOS> 'cause we're all gonna have to be able to walk around . <EOS> uh right , so <EOS> you want an animal and the characteristics of that animal . <EOS> do you have to be able to recognise what animal it is ? um <EOS>
okay . <EOS> okay everyone's ready . <EOS> hello . <EOS> so we are here for uh for uh functional design . <EOS> okay ? <EOS> so we are here for the functional design meeting mm <EOS> so first i will show the agenda so <EOS> we will uh <EOS> i will take notes during this meeting so <EOS>
right . hello everybody . <EOS> back again for another wonderful meeting . <EOS> is uh everyone ready ? <EOS> okay , <EOS> we c we can hold on for a minute . <EOS> hello . <EOS> . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> almost . <EOS> oh my gosh . <EOS>
well , since our materials aren't exactly what we were going for , i'm just gonna translate what this all means for you . <EOS> the base is gonna be gunmetal gray , which is what we had decided , <EOS> and it's gonna be plastic . <EOS> um then there's the latex cover , which is what you see as red . <EOS> um because it can be replaceable , we just kinda went with the colour . <EOS> um and then the buttons are actually kind of poking through rather than on top . <EOS> um and the buttons will be a l much lighter blue , almost see-through . <EOS> it's just sort of a very pale blue and a light-up yellow . <EOS> the whole thing lights up if you press any button , rather than it just that one button will light up . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> so <EOS> so <EOS> to prepare the prototype i would suggest that the industrial designer and the user interface designer uh work together . <EOS> that would uh <EOS> yeah . <EOS> be better , i think . <EOS> and uh <EOS> and so uh <EOS> you will receive further instruction by emails , as usual . <EOS>
i'll just just check what it said . <EOS> actually i don't think it really says anything about the cost , <EOS> but it says that it's already in the coffee machines , <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so like it's already kind of <EOS> i assume it would cost extra , <EOS> but maybe we maybe we'll find out how much that does cost and have to decide slightly later . <EOS>
alright . <EOS> y left yeah left and then uh i have to kick you out . <EOS> so something like this . <EOS> that should be pretty nice colour . <EOS> but maybe the buttons , all buttons in red is maybe a bad contrast for colourblind people . <EOS> because the of the green . <EOS>
i think um you have to keep doing the financi the the f_n_ and f_ eight to <EOS> five minutes to finish , <EOS> thank you a lot for telling me . <EOS> um right , <EOS> we're ready to close . <EOS> um will be completed q questionnaire , <EOS> um then we'll have some time for individual work to continue our research um <EOS> and i'll put some minutes of this meeting together . <EOS> um your individual assignments are for
yeah . <EOS> yeah <EOS> yeah . <EOS> just round it up . <EOS> yeah , so <EOS> y you don't want uh this uh like the ipod . <EOS> but <EOS> no . <EOS> yeah . yeah . <EOS> more rounded . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> i think it will just look like more like this one . <EOS> since it's <EOS> this is also rounded . <EOS> i think i <EOS>
'kay , well we're gonna wrap this up . <EOS> um next meeting is gonna start in thirty minutes , <EOS> and here's what we're each of us going to do . <EOS> the i_d_ is going to do the look and feel design , <EOS> the u_i_d_ the user interface design . <EOS> i think you're going to get a lot of , i mean , the final say on what buttons get put <EOS> we'll all talk about it , <EOS> but i think , that's pretty much what you're gonna do , <EOS> right ? <EOS>
so i think you can see it's real uh really a easy programme to use . not difficult at all . <EOS> wha <EOS> well , <EOS> it's okay . <EOS> okay , <EOS> thank you . <EOS> that's enough , <EOS> thanks . <EOS> janus ? the last one ? <EOS>
n and <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , yes . <EOS> something else . <EOS> and that's and that's the kind of thing people learn by feel , <EOS> and um you don't feel the mode change . <EOS> so um maybe having buttons be various shapes might be a help too . <EOS> you know , like the a triangle is for the volume and a square is for changing channels , so that people can uh develop a tactile sense of it . <EOS> but we'll get to that with you . <EOS>
well <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah i guess that depends on your definition of fancy , <EOS> but it's definitely different . <EOS> it's not your traditional <EOS> yeah . <EOS> oh definitely different yeah . <EOS> i think the colour has a lot to do with it . <EOS> i mean th the colours we were given for making the prototype aren't the colours that i think we would've necessarily chosen . <EOS> it's not the kind of ooh uh at all sleek <EOS> red , black and yellow , and orange . <EOS> um <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> we can't make it smaller than the things we see now i think . <EOS> just big enough for the buttons we have , that's that's it . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> or we have to make something uh like uh mobile phones that you can uh fold it opem . <EOS> maybe then you can make it s smaller and uniquer , <EOS>
but it's strange that the the manage board the management board said that the teletext will be uh outdated by the internet . <EOS> yeah , okay . <EOS> so that that's strange . <EOS> yeah , okay , <EOS> but uh at the moment uh teletext is yeah , th the best thing you can get uh on t_v_ , like getting information . <EOS> so uh , <EOS> when you ask people , what do they use , <EOS>
and you can bring your coffee in the reading room . <EOS> okay . <EOS> t to try the coffee ? <EOS> wait . <EOS> wait , wai wai wai wait . <EOS> next tuesday . <EOS> wait , wait . <EOS> tuesday um <EOS> uh , well well well well , <EOS> not so easy , eh ? <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> 'cause <EOS> if we are targeting you very old people this is something they really don't know why they this should be <EOS> so now <EOS> this is of course , <EOS> depends on that . <EOS> mm-mm . okay . <EOS> i got one question , <EOS> uh you are a market expert <EOS> so <EOS> should we aim at the young people or not ? <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> okay . <EOS> well um going on uh the specifications that we had , that fruit and vegetables are quite popular , and that people like something that is good to look at and not many buttons , i would give it um , <EOS> well , because it's hard to make a fruit good to look at , that that looks cool , you know , <EOS> so i would actually give it a three . <EOS> tha three or four , i'm not sure . <EOS> three . go for three . <EOS> that's fine . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> mm 'kay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> i think you could probably group plastic and rubber together , wood and titanium , <EOS> but you know it might be easier from a cost perspective and a complexity just to use one . <EOS> you know as opposed to two . <EOS> um and the other components are logic chips , um again i'll i'll go back to the component chips . <EOS> the com how complex or how easy the logic is , it depends on how many functions you have on the on the unit <EOS>
it should be something new it should be s it it should do something different than than just what we have . <EOS> now , of course , the other thing to think there is maybe the design . <EOS> yeah , of course . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , design should be , yeah it should be different . <EOS> all the almost all the remotes <EOS>
well , i don't know , <EOS> i mean , if you can like well <EOS> i don't know , <EOS> if there's just a way of leaving them out ? <EOS> unless you could say the channel . <EOS> i think people would find that too foreign . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> you definitely need <EOS>
hmm . <EOS> good morning everybody . <EOS> good morning . <EOS> good morning . <EOS> good morning . <EOS> so , we are asked to to make uh uh a new remote control for television . <EOS> and the characteristics of this new remote control should be original and trendy and of course user user friendly . <EOS> so people can can use it without any any problem . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah , yeah but you can do it with your thumb li <EOS> that's what i was just saying , <EOS> and then have the and then have the l_c_d_ at the top <EOS> and then be able to touch that for the other controls , <EOS> so have the um the volume and the programme , things like that , <EOS> on the lower side . <EOS> okay . <EOS>
'kay . <EOS> see you two in half an hour uh <EOS> uh <EOS> good luck . <EOS> yep . <EOS> okay that's the side . <EOS> ah it's it's okay . <EOS> but do we want uh options on the on the side with the with the buttons ? <EOS>
mm . <EOS> so . <EOS> i also did a little research <EOS> on um what again are the most important priorities in uh decision making about uh purchasing . <EOS> fancy . <EOS> functional is out . <EOS> and f the fancy , and that's exactly the term , i'm i'm thinking polished , elegant , you know , kind of innovative , but a cut above . <EOS> this is twice as important as the next finding , <EOS> which is technologically innovative . <EOS> this is interesting , <EOS> 'cause i think in the last meeting we were talking about technology as being so important , <EOS> but maybe what's innovative is having it simple with um with uh technologically superior fabrics or uh , you know , designed in interesting substances . <EOS> ease of use . again , pretty low , <EOS> i mean it's the top three , <EOS> but each of the uh fancy and technologically innovative are far more important . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> um wha <EOS> mm uh <EOS> i i don't think we have to be , we have to agree on that . uh <EOS> i figure we could get back to it on the next meeting actually . <EOS> i think th that's a pha <EOS> yeah . <EOS> that's a phase further . <EOS> ju just uh <EOS>
right . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> and the speech recognition could be part of the lost and found device , too . <EOS> if we said , find remote , locate remote , or something . <EOS> right . <EOS> a certain phrase then it could beep . <EOS> i dunno . <EOS> just throwing it out there . <EOS>
uh am i going in the right direction ? <EOS> no . <EOS> wait . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay , here it comes . <EOS> oh , i'm getting hungry . <EOS> okay , here you are . <EOS> cool . <EOS> ah , <EOS> that's why it won't meet . <EOS> okay , cool . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> maybe maybe two . <EOS> well <EOS> m th <EOS> but the logo is on on the front , <EOS> so a two , yeah , <EOS> that's <EOS> maybe two . <EOS> okay , true , yeah . <EOS> one d on i it's the colours and the <EOS>
d <EOS> i don't know if that might cope with like the trend-watching . <EOS> i find anything more on that . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah not yet <EOS> but maybe by the next meeting we'll have some info on that . <EOS> 'kay . so um we know that the remote's gonna have to be <EOS> we'll just say we've got a colour scheme for it . <EOS> um yellow and <EOS> you know <EOS> yellow it's nice and bright , <EOS> with the buttons being grey or black . <EOS> and our slogan pasted somewhere on it , on the the bottom <EOS> or the <EOS> you know . um <EOS>
great . <EOS> sorry . <EOS> okay , so i'm continuing with the user interface uh topic . <EOS> and so basically i consulted with our manufacturing division . <EOS> it sounded like catherine was also speaking with them . <EOS> uh i also took uh reissa's marketing findings from the last meeting into consideration um , <EOS> 'cause i think that's that's crucial as far as uh what keys we're going to inc inclu what buttons we are going to include and and how they're laid out . <EOS> uh and so the manufacturing division uh sent some some samples of of uh interface components that we might be interested in using that have been used in other products , uh like the coffee machine . <EOS>
okay . okay . <EOS> do we have an idea of costs of different components ? <EOS> um well the most the most costly components are gonna be the chip and the uh th it could als <EOS> basically the user interface and the casing are gonna be expensive as well . <EOS> um the l_e_d_ and the the transistors and everything else are you know they're they're pretty cheap . <EOS>
um . um . <EOS> curious . <EOS> um , i don't know if you'd be able to off the top of your head or not , <EOS> the single curved and double curved , would you be able to give an example ? <EOS> um could you maybe draw something ? <EOS> i you don't <EOS> doesn't have to be perfect , <EOS> it's just 'cause i'm not quite sure if i understand the difference between the two . <EOS>
no ? <EOS> that was the wrong <EOS> we we did not have any money for buying the coffee machines , so <EOS> yeah , w we can bring your coffee in the reading room , <EOS> but <EOS> so so since maybe , you're a part-time here , and part-ti part-time at e_p_f_l_ , there are at least two um coffee machines in the building , <EOS> one at the third floor , <EOS> one at the first floor . <EOS> and we can bring our coffee . <EOS> no uh automatic uh coffee machines . <EOS> so uh yeah . but , in <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> right . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> that's you , excellent . <EOS> okay , that's great , <EOS> thanks . <EOS> um that's very good , <EOS> very interesting . <EOS> um . <EOS> i'm just gonna tick yes . <EOS> so , we've got about ten , fifteen minutes to discuss <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> and so these are probably mutually exclusive options <EOS> that uh <EOS> hmm <EOS> you could argue that experience of using devices and similar devices as people get more and more used to using remotes , <EOS> therefore they're more with handling them , <EOS> therefore you can make them more complicated as time goes on . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> maybe we can have uh <EOS> but we don't design the t_v_ . <EOS> maybe we can have uh something you whistle and uh the remote control uh beep . <EOS> ah yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> barks . <EOS> barks . <EOS> yeah , barks , yeah . <EOS> so we can uh have a whistle uh remote control ? <EOS>
sorry , <EOS> carry on . <EOS> 'cause i i know as you add more buttons to the remote it sometimes gets so big and clunky <EOS> and there's just like a hundred buttons on it , <EOS> or you could have a really small slim one but then you could lose it easily . <EOS>
i'm a bit confused about uh what's the difference between the functional design and conceptual design ? <EOS> uh i is it just uh more detail , uh as i understand it ? <EOS> i think it th w we're talking the the functional design is more your um area of things where you'll be <EOS> we want to look at what functions we need in the remote control <EOS> and what what specific things it it has to do <EOS> but the conceptual design is um perhaps bigger than that <EOS> and includes the how people are going to use it and and that kind of thing . <EOS>
w <EOS> yeah . yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> just like with the telephone . <EOS> so <EOS> if the badg the batteries are dead <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i kinda like your <EOS> then you can re you can uh change them . <EOS> yeah <EOS> you got some uh some of those uh uh wireless uh mice ? mouse . computer mouse . <EOS>
um <EOS> see , i was gonna say the scroll wheel pushbutton thing , <EOS> 'cause <EOS> take it down to just a scroll wheel . <EOS> we could do <EOS> so tha that mean that we cannot press <EOS> how do we how do we make a selection in uh in the l_c_d_ ? <EOS> if <EOS> in the l_c_d_ we can scroll , right ? <EOS> but how do we make a selection if we d cannot push the button . <EOS>
yeah i like the idea , <EOS> it's a good idea . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> just as a fun gimmick . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> just to set us apart a little bit . <EOS> um , and then on to the circuit board that we're gonna use , also known as the chip . <EOS> uh , we really don't have any way around the t_a_ one one eight three five . <EOS> um findings , <EOS> okay , <EOS> we're very limited by what our current manufacturers can offer , <EOS> um and my question to all of you is , should we look to other manufacturies <EOS> or should we just make do with what we have available ? <EOS>
yeah , by content or by channel , <EOS> it's a good idea . <EOS> by content or by channel . <EOS> choose by contents or by channels . <EOS> and then what did we say just now ? other than this . <EOS> and uh we we have to find a way how to gather information about the contents . <EOS>
right . <EOS> how how it will be done . <EOS> so <EOS> whe where do we identify the components of our uh product ? <EOS> uh <EOS> i think it's it's in the conceptual design phase that we identify the <EOS> it's in the conceptual design phase that we identify the components of our product ? <EOS>
mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> we just got rid of a gimmick that was never anyway , <EOS> and the scroll wheel is i mean essentially the two buttons that was <EOS> it's not a great difference i don't think . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> alright then . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> something that you can into it . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> uh and what about the user interface concept ? <EOS> google and <EOS> google and fancy ? <EOS> and fancy , <EOS> f <EOS> how about the the voice ? <EOS> and <EOS> because i think that with the voice and gesture recognition there are still some disadvantages with this . <EOS>
yes , now i'm objecting . <EOS> no , <EOS> i mean , <EOS> i was just thinking is it really practical to start designing something with features that we're just gonna end up throwing away ? <EOS> i mean , it takes a lot of time and effort for everyone to consider different features , um <EOS>
mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> does having both really up our costs ? <EOS> i can't see how it wouldn't , <EOS> i mean , there's you know the old aphorism , <EOS> you can have it fast , <EOS> you can have it cheap <EOS> or you can have it quality , <EOS> pick two of three . <EOS> you know , you can't you can't have all three . <EOS> it's just impossible . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> mm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> okay . <EOS> mm . we can make it smart like an ipod , <EOS> you know , <EOS> make everything menus . <EOS> ooh , <EOS> closing the meeting . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> um i know this sounds like it was very quick , <EOS> but the <EOS>
to which , an l_e_ an l_e_d_ <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> would that work ? <EOS> is that <EOS> okay . <EOS> just so you know i think i mean it was my understanding that before we were gonna stay in the mid-market range . <EOS> it seems we're kind of approaching a higher-end range . <EOS> i wanna make sure everybody's okay with that . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> it's definitely <EOS> again i think the colour comes into this . <EOS> yeah colour will definitely be a factor . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> i think that the logo could be smaller . <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> and maybe not such a prominent way . <EOS> maybe like at the bottom , kind of . <EOS>
the important aspects that came out were things that we've already discussed really . <EOS> the most important by far was the look and feel of it . <EOS> it needs to be something that's very different from everything else out there . it needs to stand out . <EOS> it needs to be not functional like the rest of the things out there at the moment . <EOS> most people find remote controls boring at the moment , <EOS> we need to have something that looks interesting , that looks exciting , that will stand out . <EOS> people will wanna buy it . um <EOS> that was twice as i important as the next item on here <EOS> which is that it has to be technologically innovative <EOS> has to have something else , apart from just the look of it . <EOS> people have to then think about it and say got something there that i want . that's a really cool feature , <EOS> and it has to make them wanna buy it again . <EOS> third on the list , and again innovative was twice as important as this last um aspect , <EOS> it has to be easy to use . <EOS> so they have to be able to be able to look at it and have some intuitive idea of how to use it um . <EOS> drawing on the fashion trends at the moment , uh fruit and vegetables um . <EOS> this is basically talking about just the the feel of it , so probably not the smell of it , but the bright colours , um eye-catching , really bold designs , and a spongy feel . <EOS> um i had a talk to the design people about this , <EOS> but having a remote that's tactile , that feels different , that would be really cool . <EOS> that would make it stand out . um . <EOS>
go ahead . <EOS> mm . <EOS> right . <EOS> appropriate , okay . <EOS> mm 'kay . <EOS> it is an option . <EOS> oh , right . <EOS> that's this here . <EOS> ah . i see . <EOS> um , what other things do we see here , well , um <EOS> if you give it a touch it does have actually a bit of a spongy feel , <EOS> um , so <EOS> i think that will work well with regards to our market . <EOS> um and uh <EOS> let's see , <EOS> well <EOS> clearly there's gonna be some more colours and what not available . <EOS> um uh <EOS> do you have anything else to add to that ? <EOS>
okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> to building a prototype , based on this , <EOS> okay ? <EOS> so next meeting you guys have to prepare the followi things . <EOS> you have to uh work on the look and feel uh design <EOS> and you have to work on the user interface , <EOS> in fact you two you have to work together to model the first uh f first prototype . <EOS>
. okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> well well a worry that was was expressed in the new requirements was that if we made this too complex it would e it would effect um how long how long it took us to get this to market , <EOS> so i th suspect it might be a good idea just to restrict our kind of our creative influence on this on the user interface <EOS> and not worry so much about uh how we transmit it <EOS> um because i mean it it's tried and tested intra-red , <EOS> so we could stay with tha <EOS>
sorry . <EOS> um and and we s we saw that the um what we needed to do was to to make sure the device um controls several items , <EOS> that switching was easy , <EOS> that you shouldn't need to point the thing at uh anything in particular , <EOS> um that it need to be contoured to make it interesting , <EOS> that the keys might be concave , <EOS> simply because that hasn't been done before that we know of . <EOS> um should have interchangeable fascias <EOS> so people can personalise it , <EOS> um illuminated <EOS> so that people can see it in dark rooms . <EOS> um and that people might want it as as in addition to their existing remote controls . <EOS> um and that it sh it should just always work , whenever you uh um mm uh use it . <EOS> and that it shouldn't be too small , <EOS> mm that it it gets lost . um . <EOS> now uh uh <EOS> i'll shortly ask for for three three presentations . <EOS> uh before i do that , however , i will go through some new project requirements <EOS> that um the the management have placed on us <EOS> and uh will be challenging in terms of what we discussed at the first meeting . <EOS> um the uh
but if you've already got the remote control in your hand you need to open the flip to use the voice , why use the voice , why not just use your hand ? <EOS> i mean the whole point of the voice is that if the remote control is sitting there and i'm too lazy to reach over and pick it up , i can just use my voice . <EOS>
you <EOS> yeah , yeah , oh yeah i presu you wouldn't have to wind it for very long , <EOS> but i don't i don't think it's really sort of necessary when you th you think of the next two options , <EOS> like the the solar charging , <EOS> 'cause most people have the light on in the room anyway so they could get when when you got t_v_ . <EOS>
breaking , <EOS> oh right . <EOS> well you see , <EOS> that's why hard plastic would be quite a good thing for it , <EOS> because then it'd just be rigid . <EOS> you know <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i like the fact that on both of them the keys play such a prominent role . <EOS>
not really . <EOS> i'll yeah i'll have a look , <EOS> try look at the actual appearance in the next break . <EOS> 'kay . <EOS> i th i <EOS> i do still think it needs to be something that is ultimately one-handed . <EOS> the ball is probably not a good idea . <EOS> and even something that's held like that might be difficult . <EOS> so that i think it still has to be a variation . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> like with your key-chain , if you whistle it goes uh it makes a sound . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> hm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so you know where it is . <EOS> no . <EOS> yeah . so <EOS> audio signal should be possible as well . <EOS> i think it's not too expensive . <EOS>
evaluation . <EOS> the the product or the project ? <EOS> the the the well the i meant the product . <EOS> um , well well <EOS> my presentation just now ? <EOS> sure , <EOS> uh can i get the <EOS> yeah . <EOS> oh <EOS> sorry <EOS> yeah um , mm . <EOS>
black . <EOS> yeah , yellow light . <EOS> do we have yellow light ? <EOS> no , not really , but it's possible . <EOS> it's <EOS> a bit a bit of yellow . <EOS> not not not yellow , but just a bit of light yellow . <EOS> black white , maybe ? <EOS>
i think one of <EOS> i tho i tho i thou <EOS> i think rol ro rolls-royce might mind , but don't worry . <EOS> i think w , yeah , one of the things that we should also keep in mind um when we're doing this i mean our company's slogan is we put the fashion in electronics , right . <EOS> so i think our kind of our target here is to have some kind of very like sleek nice look remote <EOS> and we want it to be functional as well , <EOS> but i think one of the main selling points is that we don't want it to be clunky like like this thing here . <EOS> you know we don't wanna a big clunker . <EOS> we want something that looks nice and it's fashionable and so <EOS>
um it would just only affect the form , for as far as i know . <EOS> so <EOS> it's j really just up to the design department what we're gonna use . <EOS> it doesn't really matter for the price or the functionality . <EOS> okay . <EOS> so <EOS> we can pretty much just do whatever we want . <EOS>
oh i i it <EOS> or regular chip ? <EOS> i think it's going to be y y <EOS> yeah it's th with the regular chip , yeah . <EOS> i think yeah regular , today we you can do that with regular chip . <EOS> say say it's regular , regular chip , <EOS> and we still on fifteen , <EOS> so <EOS>
okay . <EOS> do you need the border ? <EOS> uh i'm just gonna use the powerpoint uh . <EOS> okay . <EOS> sorry . <EOS> technical . okay . <EOS> adjusting . <EOS> okay , so , while this is warming up , <EOS> there it is uh . <EOS>
a actually it depends , it depends what kind of functionalities you want to add into it , <EOS> for example if you add two more functionalities then better you add two more buttons , <EOS> or and you'll have l_c_d_ display which is that is going to bring the cost by two two euros at least . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> okay . <EOS> 'kay <EOS> i i think now that the idea's clear . <EOS> uh we should now uh try to decide um on our target group . <EOS> yep . <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
but what are they gonna be next <EOS> yeah . <EOS> what are they gonna be next year . <EOS> but but th but okay but you you can incorporate the tr <EOS> if y if you change all the buttons then you've got the problem that this year's fruit and veg , next year's uh i was gonna say animals or elephants or w whatever . <EOS> that means you're constantly changing your production schedule , <EOS> and you've gotta make different moulds and everything else , <EOS> so that's not a good idea i would i would suggest . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> oh yeah . <EOS> the option , just the option , that's cool . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> uh i i set something on paper already , size , looks , uh usable , <EOS> uh the buttons on usable places , <EOS> uh the the on off button must be on top , <EOS> uh it has to lay good in the hand , <EOS> you you have to uh <EOS>
maybe it is it just n <EOS> mm ? <EOS> eight , eight point two . <EOS> nine points , <EOS> okay , yes . <EOS> that's <EOS> hmm ? <EOS> eight point two , right ? <EOS> so , we <EOS> looks like we are well within budget . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> and here i have the results <EOS> so you can see that um seventy five per cent of users find most remote controls ugly <EOS> so we have to find something to make them more more nice , more kind . <EOS> eighty per cents of users would spend more money when the remote control would look fancy . <EOS> eighty hundred per cent of users would spend more money when the remote control would look <EOS> oh <EOS> to <EOS> it's not good . <EOS> so okay . <EOS> so it's not in theory <EOS> but i i can i can say yeah . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> and uh right so <EOS> thanks for that . <EOS> let's just uh head back to work on what we were talking about <EOS> bef uh goi h h getting into . <EOS> with half an hour ? <EOS> um . yes . <EOS> 'kay . <EOS> perfect . <EOS>
like like peeling of the banana you s <EOS> yeah , peeling of the banana . <EOS> it would be cool , yeah . <EOS> peeling of the banana , you know , <EOS> should should discover the other buttons , which are hidden . <EOS> mm what ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> for uh uh for <EOS> yeah yeah . <EOS> for left-handed users also . <EOS> yep . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah <EOS> we <EOS> um is it possible to um program it s so uh you got on the left side uh or on the right side uh buttons for for shifting u up and shifting up ? and on the uh other uh uh o other side uh buttons for uh shifting , uh for for the sound ? <EOS> or or isn't it ? <EOS>
tu-dumm . <EOS> uh . <EOS> mm i'll clean that up later . <EOS> this is <EOS> that's my new interface . <EOS> what's that ? <EOS> that's a uh edited smiley . <EOS> tom-ti-dom . uh . <EOS> okay . <EOS>
six . <EOS> yep . <EOS> remote . <EOS> so seven , seven , <EOS> six , <EOS> seven for me . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> six . <EOS> six point five . <EOS> functional . <EOS> i'll give five . <EOS> four . <EOS> i would say <EOS> well it depends when you say functional , do you mean it does what we want it to do , or d does what it does , you know , can it make you coffee ? <EOS>
oh yeah . yeah . <EOS> like the t like the telephone . <EOS> no , <EOS> i think it's a great idea if we can design it to to suit those requirements . <EOS> no <EOS> because i this is this is years ago in the united states <EOS> where we're driving down <EOS> and he said call home , <EOS> and the telephone called immediately <EOS> so well , <EOS> that's kinda cute . <EOS>
just half a day , you have a remote . <EOS> there you go . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> right from the start of the day . <EOS> yeah i think <EOS> we sort of knew where we were going straight away i thought . <EOS> we st we started off a little little weak . <EOS> our leadership was quite weak in the beginning . <EOS> um um <EOS>
mm . <EOS> of fruits . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> remotes <EOS> objects , okay . <EOS> s objects . <EOS> crazy objects . <EOS> i think that would be funny at the beginning but after one month you will be tired of be surrounded of fruits . <EOS> well , you're the one who wanted to do fruit in the first place . <EOS>
yeah , w we've done a a lot of detail in light , so <EOS> yeah , and you can uh also choose your light , so <EOS> ye <EOS> yeah , this it is a one . <EOS> it's okay . it's cool . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i think it's one . <EOS> okay , next . <EOS> learnable ? easy to use ? <EOS>
logo , brand . <EOS> mm . <EOS> mm 'kay . <EOS> but th th they're referring to the fruit and veg thing . <EOS> is this like a banana type colour ? <EOS> could we stretch <EOS> no still , <EOS> it's not shaped like a banana is <EOS> yes . <EOS> it's kind o it <EOS> probably <EOS>
but you don't <EOS> but uh , yeah , you don't see it . <EOS> well , hang on . <EOS> the other option is , i don't know if you can see it but it's like if <EOS> i can find it again . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> it's like the second to last slide . <EOS>
oh i it doesn't matter which end you point , i guess . <EOS> we could have a little l_e_d_s on each end . <EOS> yeah , i appreciate this idea , <EOS> because then this this will help us in our advertisement also <EOS> and we can relate with fruits and vegetables , the people's choices . <EOS> that what our data shows that , <EOS> so this w this w <EOS>
hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> okay . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> 'kay . <EOS> uh . <EOS> well , do you wan do you wanna finish up your your whole presentation then ? <EOS> are you are you all done ? <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> and this this uh child uh interface has minimum buttons <EOS> and all the important uh buttons are there in this small , compact , <EOS> attractive child interface . <EOS> next slide , please . <EOS> now this is a big over-sized remote which cannot be misplaced or it's impossible to misplace . <EOS> this . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> and the expense . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> uh organic globby sort of feeling to it then you might have trouble incorporating the screen . <EOS> mm . <EOS> um , but i guess not <EOS> i thin we'll just we'll just pretend that's not a problem . <EOS> um uh <EOS> and how are you about the glow in the dark material ? <EOS> is that <EOS>
we don't have all the options . <EOS> charger we don't have charger here either . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> no it's <EOS> but it's just if you want all functionalities . <EOS> it's below the the the budget . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> excuse me ? <EOS> it's below the bu the budget . <EOS>
no , <EOS> otherwise we don't have an l_c_d_ screen . <EOS> no ? <EOS> ma y you just can't do that , or uh <EOS> no . <EOS> and what did you change ? <EOS> you changed the uh scroll wheel <EOS> and <EOS> we changed th <EOS> yeah , <EOS> and the single curved to uncurved . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> yes <EOS> but i can <EOS> i think uh i think we can just use more cheap plastic for a kind of basic edition , <EOS> and then people can fancy it up with with more expensive materials <EOS> which which come with a with another price . <EOS>
uh okay . <EOS> right , okay . yeah . <EOS> and we've got some pictures of some uh new remote controls to show you . <EOS> do i press escape f_ five ? or just <EOS> excellent . <EOS> uh no just escape <EOS> escape , okay . <EOS> should uh <EOS>
we've all broke a remote control ri um s yeah . <EOS> i've <EOS> yeah we've all broken a remote control . <EOS> so you've also got um you've got your chip here , your batteries here , and some sorta electronics . um <EOS> i just love you tech guys , huh . <EOS> they just
i think a child would try to eat it anyway , <EOS> so maybe we should <EOS> yeah . <EOS> consider that . <EOS> maybe health and safety aspects . <EOS> ah yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> oh we didn't think of that yet . yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
but the the spinning wheel's not there . <EOS> i have think maybe it's integrated with the l_c_ display ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay , let's yeah . <EOS> we've got more than one pushbutton though , <EOS> haven't we ? <EOS> i think the pushbutton <EOS> oh . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> and uh second thing is there's too much of confusion here . <EOS> no particular remote is standard . <EOS> mm . <EOS> like , some some people have a <EOS> here you see this ? <EOS> this is on a i i <EOS> i found th that uh only common feature is the ch uh channel control and uh volume control , <EOS> rest other buttons , they are in a very disorganized <EOS> and they are not consistent th with other models and all . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> that has a lot of that has a lot of appeal <EOS> but i think uh i'm i'm talking about the functionality now on it whether we're looking at different groups . <EOS> i think the children issue can be addressed with the shape and with colours . <EOS> you know , like you make it nice and pink , fluorescent , banana colour or whatever you know <EOS> yeah , for example you know . <EOS> but the question is really , who is our target group . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah that's a very good idea , yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> functionality , the way the mobile phones work , the way the keypad looks . also just the way that a lot of industrial design is going into mobile phones at the moment . <EOS> they're big selling items . <EOS> people put a lot of thought into that <EOS> so we can leverage off that , <EOS> and we can start using some of their ideas . <EOS> um back to technological in in innovation , not quite as important , <EOS> but still a big issue . <EOS> um we talked about having a way of finding a remote control if it's been lost , <EOS> uh that's one thing we could look at . <EOS> there are other aspects like l_c_d_ screens and speech recognition which weren't i don't think , in my personal opinion , gonna be worth the extra expense and the extra effort that will go into them . <EOS> i think we're better doing something basic like this <EOS> which is very important <EOS> and very will be a really cool feature to put in . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> after two minutes , <EOS> yeah two three minutes , yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> functional designs uh for the elderly uh you could make it possible to enlarge the screen , <EOS> so make it possible to not uh display uh a button at ten points <EOS> uh , or <EOS>
right <EOS> kendra . <EOS> i'm kendra <EOS> and i'm the us user interface designer and um <EOS> i haven't had a whole lot of experience in this kind of thing before <EOS> but i'm m <EOS> so <EOS> i'll be working on the design . <EOS> right <EOS> at least means you haven't got any preconceived ideas <EOS> so . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> true . <EOS> very true . very true . <EOS> very much so . um <EOS> yeah , it's like , yep <EOS> it's ubiquitous <EOS> isn't it ? <EOS> taped with duck tape and what have you , <EOS> you wouldn't have that problem if you used rubber . <EOS>
i don't know , <EOS> but i'll find out more at our next meeting . <EOS> okay , tha that would be great , <EOS> so if you find out from the technology background , okay , <EOS> so that would be good . <EOS> sounds good . <EOS> why was the plastic eliminated as a possible material ? <EOS>
yeah , it's not distance problem it it's recognising a person's voice , <EOS> like maybe different people will be having different voices , <EOS> so it like it's uh everything so i <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> uh . <EOS> well , you you teach you have to teach uh <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> you could name it after fruits and vegetables , or <EOS> yeah . <EOS> and it could the colour can fit your sitting room , <EOS> so if you have red sitting room you can have strawberry , and then if you have a green one you can have <EOS> well i don't know . um . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> okay , i dunno if you had this information already . <EOS> no , <EOS> so they want us to restrict the remote control to t_v_ only because of time limitations . <EOS> um they want also uh <EOS> no . <EOS> actually this marketing report is restricted to t_v_ remote controls . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> . <EOS> yeah , i think um we could do l the logo in grey , as it is on the website . <EOS> cool . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> we ran out of resources here , so . <EOS> in the actual one . <EOS>
oh yeah <EOS> that that i think <EOS> i thought that was a quite good <EOS> so i <EOS> yeah . <EOS> because it's a gadget <EOS> and you want to show it off , of course . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah yeah <EOS> you have a fancy design , then , right away . <EOS> so <EOS>
yeah this is the the initial specifications . <EOS> yeah . yeah . <EOS> yeah yeah sure . <EOS> um <EOS> five . <EOS> i would say six . <EOS> it's quite cheap actually . <EOS> i'd say two . <EOS> i don't want a banana on my living room table , a banana remote . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> tomato red or whatever <EOS> and second thing is cer certain standard buttons we should have , <EOS> like for example , i if you see the previous slide uh <EOS> well , yeah we <EOS> i think most of the users would now be well acquainted with this cer central pattern , here , <EOS> so we we we would not change h that particular pattern <EOS> because i this is the most consistent thing in all remote controls . <EOS>
alright . <EOS> okay . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah <EOS> that's what i was thinking , to <EOS> sure , okay . <EOS> we didn't have enough play-doh to make it three d_ . <EOS> yeah alright yeah fair enough . <EOS> okay , just thought i'd ask . <EOS> so there's one more dimension to the thing which we need to to add , <EOS> and you might want to add in the report , <EOS> length , width , and height . <EOS>
on <EOS> uh train it , okay . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> too complex . <EOS> but uh very very good to sell . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> no , <EOS> even in <EOS> you can find even simple mobile device like any mobile brand you can have these voice dialers or these things , yeah . <EOS>
i it's it's i this shape is a lemon like , so <EOS> it would be bet more like a lemon ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> if <EOS> because i <EOS> i dunno , maybe improving the texture of like having it less smooth or <EOS> yeah . <EOS> less button . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> um . yeah , <EOS> and the other thing you said that thing about robust and water um <EOS> what was the word ? <EOS> water resistant . <EOS> furry . <EOS> oh i was just <EOS> no but it's <EOS> i thought , ah , spot on . <EOS> good feel , tact tactile , good tactile feel , <EOS> maybe something didn doesn't make your hands sweat lot . <EOS>
nah , maybe <EOS> ah <EOS> that's a problem , <EOS> but <EOS> and and uh w yeah ? <EOS> uh only in english . only in english i think . <EOS> what <EOS> but uh i dunno how that works then . <EOS> uh does your uh <EOS> does it lie in the centre of the room and can you scream from wherever <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> cool . <EOS> it was fun . <EOS> so <EOS> well done with the management , i felt well managed . <EOS> oh thanks . <EOS> i think we did well in first of all giving our meetings the time , <EOS> and second we actually <EOS> it's kinda fun . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> and the marketing expert with the product evaluation . <EOS> in this phase , the two of you , jana and francine , have to work together on a prototype using modelling clay , it says here . <EOS> you will receive specific instructions will be sent to you by your coaches . <EOS>
okay , <EOS> so we can just go um . <EOS> but will we w actually we'll need two , <EOS> won't we ? <EOS> one for the top and then one for the s one e for each side . <EOS> but it that just covers the type of button we're having . <EOS> because we're not doing a scroll on the side , it's still push-button . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> is that okay with you ? <EOS> how you feeling ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> interesting . because <EOS> yeah . <EOS> and let's like see if we get anything else . <EOS> i mean i'm not like hard-sold on the scroll wheel , <EOS> it's more just to give it a different kind of look , <EOS> but if it's gonna be in a latex type thing and that's gonna look cool , then that's probably gonna have a bigger impact than the scroll wheel . <EOS>
and we have um maybe we have to we say , only for t_v_ , not teletext ? <EOS> uh i think automatic on off control uh it's not possible . <EOS> uh it's in current price , yeah . <EOS> difficult . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> maybe in the next uh step if we make it work um . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> th <EOS> right , yeah , okay . <EOS> so we don't have any normal buttons <EOS> that uh <EOS> no , alright . <EOS> no , no normal buttons , yeah . <EOS> maybe only the on and o on and off button . <EOS> but i don't think <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> mm 'kay . <EOS> or browse . <EOS> mm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> so people are used to that kind of shape , <EOS> right . <EOS> don't take care too much about the colour <EOS> because w <EOS> yeah <EOS> we don't take <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so <EOS> here would be basically the the the infrared uh uh led <EOS> yeah l_a_ l_a_ l_e_d_ , <EOS>
i think he made that . <EOS> what's that ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> and then obviously the uh the materials <EOS> when it <EOS> has anybody got like an overall picture in their mind about what what might work ? <EOS> well i mean i'm thinking that what we need to do is have something that kind of unifies a lot of the different concepts , <EOS> and if we think that what we are w our number one marketing motive is um the look and feel . <EOS> so for the look and feel to seem coherent and not just sorta bits and bits and pieces of of concept and technology or or whatever or fashion , then we should have it kind of come back to one thing that we kind of all sorta can visualize . <EOS>
mm-hmm . that's it . <EOS> a blue and black zebra . <EOS> yes . <EOS> can you can meet them in africa , i think . <EOS> yes . very good . so <EOS> the very rare blue zebras . yes . <EOS> i'll tell to get it off my <EOS>
okay , so that's something <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> okay <EOS> so <EOS> okay . <EOS> mm 'kay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay , so , my personal preferences in this um project are really have to concentrate on the sizzle . <EOS> that is the selling point , the thing that's gonna make it an impulse purchase . <EOS> uh because once there's no be-back , <EOS> well in sales they always say you know , be-backs don't come back . <EOS> if somebody says , oh i'll come back and get it next week you're dead . <EOS> they're never gonna come back and buy it . <EOS> you've gotta make it attractive enough so they buy it now now now w <EOS> now is a big word in in my book for selling this thing . <EOS>
so , he's coming . <EOS> . i did get a bit more done than the last time , <EOS> 'cause i knew that i didn't have time so i just copy and paste everything into the <EOS> or not . <EOS> okay . <EOS> oh okay . <EOS> ah , <EOS> i can't cut and paste it into the other folder but <EOS>
okay . <EOS> uh . <EOS> i received an email with uh a few possibilities on uh the materials . <EOS> so i'll discuss them with you . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay , <EOS> we're just going to the later . <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> i received an email as well . <EOS>
but can't you just get <EOS> do <EOS> do you know what i'm talking about though ? <EOS> like , uh , yeah just something <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah like maybe something on the side where you slip a panel down and it's got a whole bunch of <EOS> k <EOS>
okay . <EOS> is it unlocked ? <EOS> mm . <EOS> . <EOS> no . <EOS> yeah that's my presentation . <EOS> woah . <EOS> i uh kind of opened it . <EOS> huh ? <EOS> mm . <EOS> mm ? <EOS> oh right . <EOS> what the <EOS> uh <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> uh , where am i ? <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay , so , we have to decide on which functions we're going to actually have . <EOS> 'kay . <EOS> uh , now , <EOS> we had as listed options we had <EOS> speech recognition potentially , <EOS> flat screen interface , l_c_d_ interface um <EOS> we also want to limit the number of buttons <EOS> so we'll pretty much take that one as read . <EOS> we'll use the the basic functions for a television . <EOS> no teletext . <EOS> um <EOS> okay hold on . <EOS>
and we're actually quite open to be able to expand the product for a later version with those features quite simply anyway , aren't we ? <EOS> th there's no fundamentally different technology to do that . <EOS> well one of one of the thoughts that i had is can can this unit be be produced in a way that makes it upgradable ? <EOS> you know uh like like a um a sim card in a in a um in a telephone . <EOS> you know is there a card in th can we make a card and so after <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> alright . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> so you you'd need like a separate base for that or like something you can <EOS> right . <EOS> it would have to be sold separately because if the sender's on the remote then you'd have to find the remote first to click the button to find the remote . <EOS>
and could it be adapted ? <EOS> i guess it's possible . <EOS> i mean instead of recording the answers you can just uh record uh something simpler like a command . <EOS> okay and there can uh recognize some commands and stuff ? <EOS> yeah you reco recognize commands and you can record new commands and stuff , <EOS> so if they already have it as uh as a chip <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> oh it would be flat inside . <EOS> you could have a flat screen inside , yeah , <EOS> but i'm just wondering whether we want an l_c_d_ screen inside . <EOS> it wouldn't be like full colour , it would just be black and white , <EOS> but there'd be touch touch buttons , <EOS> so you wouldn't be pressing down on 'em , <EOS> w or we could have rubber buttons which are made of this material which is anti-r_s_i_ . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> and if it's yellow ? <EOS> and if it if it was done yellow , which is a company colour . <EOS> right . <EOS> it's it's yellow . it's curved . <EOS> i it's yellow . <EOS> grey buttons yeah . <EOS> well so why not add a couple of grey stripes and make it look like a banana ? <EOS>
mm 'kay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay <EOS> i think that the last point is probably quite uh straightforward . <EOS> obviously the the w it has to be branded . <EOS> so then the double r_ will be our our <EOS> 'kay . <EOS> on the product yeah . <EOS> can you handle that black and yellow ? <EOS>
okay , thanks . <EOS> okay so , elephant goes like this , <EOS> and then it has four feet . <EOS> i don't know whether there's any dist there should be any distance or not , but <EOS> i think this is the easiest . <EOS> and then we have it's trunk . <EOS> and <EOS> yep something like this . <EOS> an eye , <EOS> cute . <EOS> yeah , so <EOS>
well <EOS> well , what do we need a speaker for in a remote control unit ? <EOS> mm , i dunno . <EOS> be cool . <EOS> channel two . <EOS> it'd be it'd be cool , but they are saying they've just developed it , <EOS> i'm just guessing . but it's gonna be the most expensive option , probably and <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> no . <EOS> no , <EOS> because you see now all the t_v_ programmes are available on the webs . <EOS> they they are they are they are available in x_m_l_ format or whatever the format . <EOS> we don't care . <EOS> we just say that this are some content . <EOS> we just want to retrieve the content <EOS> and then classi sort them by the types of programmes . <EOS> some of the websites they already provide this service , <EOS> so we can just use the service available . <EOS> download it uh to the to this remote control . <EOS> and then there's there are only six buttons for six categories , or sev seven . <EOS> the most there are only seven buttons . <EOS> so i just choose the category one <EOS> and you reuse the same button , for example to to choose among the the sorted list the programme you want , <EOS> so you don't have to choose among hundred channels , if you have hundred channels , <EOS> you just have six buttons , seven buttons . <EOS>
we don't have a lot of time left <EOS> and we will still have to make a decision , <EOS> and the marketing expert has to present her her thing . <EOS> okay . <EOS> go right to my first my next slide . <EOS> uh okay . <EOS> um alright , my method is uh i'm interested in what the competition is doing , and wanna see how we can make ourselves different from the competition , <EOS> so i've really been looking at the press and the ads that are out there for other remote controllers . <EOS> i s i spend a lot of time on the internet um surfing around doing the same thing . <EOS> and then when i'm out um in people's houses or at meetings or anything like that , i try to notice what kind of remote controls people have , <EOS> and if it's convenient in the conversation i ask about it . <EOS> and i would encourage you all to do the same . <EOS> um and my findings from this is that , you know , small is beautiful . <EOS> um people like something that really fits in their hand . <EOS> simple is beautiful . <EOS> they don't want to have to squint at small print um , <EOS> they want buttons whose functions are obvious , and they want um as few buttons as possible , <EOS> and they don't care for the mode thing . <EOS> they want each button to do something . <EOS> and eye-catching is important . <EOS> it's gotta look cute , it's gotta look appealing . <EOS> go ahead , <EOS> i'm trying to finish fast for you . <EOS> um and our preference is , as far as i'm concerned , are we got to get to the market before the competition . <EOS> ours has to be look really great and it has to come out before the others , <EOS> so that we have a leg up on time to sell it and push it before other people get out their christmas item . <EOS> and we should develop one or two features we can really dwell on in our ad campaign . <EOS> if we try to tell people it has too many great features , um the consumer just gets confused and we don't get anywhere . <EOS> so we've gotta narrow our selection down to li two things , i think , that we gonna say are really great about our our our new product . <EOS> and i've been looking around um at what designs every year different things are popular . <EOS> and in my research this year i found out that fruit and vegetable shapes are really popular . <EOS> and people are tired of hard plastic and hard metal . <EOS> they are more back into soft feel , spongy feeling things , things with maybe a little cloth on them . <EOS> so those are things maybe we wanna look at as far as saleability of the item . <EOS>
that's what <EOS> mm-hmm . mm-hmm . <EOS> okay <EOS> so i'll remove it . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i say that <EOS> s <EOS> yeah . <EOS> and we have sev <EOS> so don't we need a <EOS> oh there is no listing for r radio frequency thing . <EOS> so <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> so what i and do w is it okay . <EOS> so i think the costs are within the budget . <EOS> we're just at twelve fifty euros . <EOS> so <EOS> do you think you can celebrate your creation ? <EOS> yeah , the pr at <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> mm 'kay . <EOS> good . um . <EOS> today uh we will uh talk about uh conceptual design . <EOS> i hope uh you both did some uh some work uh mm-hmm . <EOS> concerning a uh conceptual design . um this will be the uh agenda for the meeting uh . <EOS> uh i will take some minutes uh again . <EOS> um we will have the presentations of y of you different team members , <EOS> and then try to come to decisions uh about the concepts uh you have presented . <EOS>
we're already at eleven . <EOS> okay <EOS> so i put rubber one . <EOS> okay so special colour , yellow . <EOS> uh for the interface we have <EOS> yeah . <EOS> we don't have any push buttons . <EOS> no , we have two push buttons . <EOS> we have three . <EOS>
well <EOS> i uh think that's a very interesting idea , <EOS> but um i'm not a very good industrial designer <EOS> and i don't know much about what these things cost . <EOS> i'll do some research for the next meeting . <EOS> well <EOS> it's better than my idea about solar , probably . <EOS> yeah , yeah . <EOS> depen <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> ye yeah . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> i mean it it's like <EOS> it's like two types no ? <EOS> people are right handed or left handed <EOS> so y because i am left handed i use like this , say if you're right handed you use like this <EOS> or so tha your switch on and off should be on <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
the then nn <EOS> no . <EOS> tha <EOS> not too expensive too . <EOS> but the there's there's n there's n not enough motivation for them to replace their old controller with a new one if there's no key feature in the new controller . <EOS> that's the same <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
alright . <EOS> okay . <EOS> let's do it . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> okay . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> could we carry out some research if we w really need this , <EOS> like how many people really need to go to channel number twenty five and then to sixty four ? <EOS> well <EOS> i could could uh have a look at that maybe . <EOS> i'll check in my department if there's someone specialist in that . <EOS>
yeah . yeah . <EOS> ah yeah . <EOS> so we've listed a couple of uh <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> functions . <EOS> s uh functions <EOS> that may be uh used by u the user in the current uh available uh remote controls <EOS> and uh well <EOS> the tables look very nice to read <EOS> but what is important <EOS> is to understand that the power button is not used often <EOS> because in general you use it only once per session , <EOS> but it is very relevant . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> and ones tha ones that have rubbery spikes <EOS> y you know , you could just go so far with it , <EOS> like a puffer fish , <EOS> you could just , you could take it wherever , <EOS> so i think that's quite a flexible thing . <EOS>
oh . <EOS> uh . <EOS> yeah ? <EOS> oh , okay . <EOS> yep . <EOS> oh , <EOS> it isn't , <EOS> well okay . <EOS> remember . <EOS> no . <EOS> oh well , <EOS> it doesn't . <EOS> put the cor cursor on the . <EOS> because younger peoples are cr critical <EOS> and they wanted a lot of features on this thing . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> mm . because y <EOS> w w w w we need to decide on on on on in how far we go to in this . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mean , you can go pretty far i f i think with with with functions and possible uh future p uh prospects <EOS> yes . <EOS>
for the speech recognition you you don't need anything . <EOS> you just say channel fifty , and that's it . <EOS> well the thing is i think i think the type of peop <EOS> i think the type of people that are gonna want to buy a very stylish rem r remote control with lots of new technologies are the kinda people that are gonna have you know a wireless internet connection maybe , or a you know . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> what about a smell ? <EOS> t to the remote ? <EOS> just design-wise . <EOS> mm . nice one . <EOS> you could just sell it in different colours as well i suppose . <EOS> in different ye yellows . <EOS> i don't suppose we have to stick to co <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> d fifteen ? <EOS> seventeen . <EOS> okay , that's expensive . <EOS> seventeen pounds . <EOS> should we be making notes of this ? <EOS> we can just refer to this later can't we ? <EOS> yeah , okay . <EOS> but <EOS> i think so , i think so , <EOS> i'll be able to um pull it up , <EOS> or i could put it in the shared folder or something . <EOS>
ready ? <EOS> okay <EOS> hang on . <EOS> 'kay . <EOS> see if it's there . <EOS> which one is it ? <EOS> i don't know . <EOS> hang on . <EOS> interface concepts , <EOS> no ? <EOS> interface concepts new . <EOS> either refresh it , <EOS> or it sh <EOS> oh wait , <EOS> maybe i didn't put it there . <EOS> hang on . <EOS>
oh okay , yeah . <EOS> yes , i think so . <EOS> yep . <EOS> i'll do that next time . <EOS> um i'll act as secretary for this meeting <EOS> and just take minutes as we go through , <EOS> and then i'll send them to you after the meeting . <EOS> the main the main focus of this meeting is your presentations that you've been preparing during the time , <EOS> so we'll go through each of you one by one . <EOS> um then we need to briefly discuss the new project requirements that were sent to us . <EOS> i just sent <EOS> at the last minute , <EOS> i'm sorry about that , <EOS> but we can see how that affects what you were you were doing . <EOS> um and <EOS> then we need to , by the end of the meeting come to some kind of decision on who our target group's going to be <EOS> and what the functions of the remote control <EOS> that's the <EOS> the main goal is to come up with those two things , target group and functions of the remote control . <EOS> and we've got forty minutes to do that in . <EOS>
no . <EOS> no . <EOS> no . darn . <EOS> uh . <EOS> a rabbit . <EOS> yes , that's a rabbit . <EOS> that's my favourite one . <EOS> a what ? <EOS> a rabbit . <EOS> a r a rabbit , oh oh yeah , <EOS> where is the carrot ? <EOS> okay mm-hmm . <EOS>
maybe we can make uh different modes for each button <EOS> and you can change mode zapping mode or <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . alright . <EOS> listening more . <EOS> uh current chan <EOS> yeah , yeah . <EOS> yeah <EOS> but since we are focusing only on t_v_ remote controls <EOS> so we can have more functions for t_v_ <EOS> uh if you want to go for a universal then we ought to limit for functions for each of our devices . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> this is the teletext . <EOS> start s the <EOS> the start uh to to to <EOS> programme yeah . <EOS> the programme button , <EOS> yeah the programme button . <EOS> so this bl this button will be used both for the favourites and for programming your uh the um the type of television you wanna use . <EOS> so um the plastic is the white area of this of the model here , <EOS> and the red area is like a rubber covering . <EOS> so you can see that when it lays like this or like this <EOS> and the buttons are all gonna be rubber , so it's pretty hard to actually damage it um <EOS>
but it's uh <EOS> i don't use that <EOS> but again , uh i might <EOS> that's why you don't have it . that's why , <EOS> 'cause it's nasty . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> bu but <EOS> but it would be expensive , no ? if you use colour l_c_d_ . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> an automatically search function for each television , or something . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> or <EOS> i dunno how it's uh exactly how it works . <EOS> it wasn't explained there . <EOS> well , <EOS> i i use a universal uh remote control , <EOS> and list of all the t_v_s you have , etcetera . <EOS> and you have to put in a number , <EOS> so it works on your t_v_ . <EOS>
and then full screen . <EOS> cause that's where m my discussion starts . <EOS> right well um since i'm in charge of trying to figure out what we should put on this thing since i have to try to sell it . <EOS> um i thought that the method i should follow would be gather suggestions from everybody , <EOS> and th the reason i just put that there like that is that uh in the init in the initial stage i think i should just be open to lots of suggestions . <EOS> you know you can say anything you want no matter how silly it sounds <EOS> you know it should run your car , it should heat up your motor if should um turn on your c_d_ <EOS> whatever you want it to do <EOS> um and then as we go on what we'll have to do is accept and eliminate these suggestions according to um design and budget feasibility . <EOS>
evaluation drops . <EOS> design . doodle . <EOS> and i think we should then move on to the production evaluation because of the time . <EOS> and erase the mic . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> goodbye mic . <EOS> all i need is no mic . <EOS> let's see , <EOS> we can save this now . <EOS>
a tracker , yeah . <EOS> 'cause that uh what it type of , yeah , <EOS> for voice activation would it be like a certain term what we would say like , <EOS> hmm . <EOS> because people could just be talking and we don't want it going off all the time . <EOS>
mm okay . <EOS> so can you go to the next slide please ? <EOS> okay . <EOS> so i i just would like to uh add some extra features to the remote controller <EOS> um i think these are the very simple features and uh they don't take much uh uh much of the um um investment also , <EOS> it's like el the text or buttons which uh which are there on the uh remote controller they those we can make uh um like fluorescent <EOS> uh they'll be like light emitting if it is dark so that you can find your remote controller if it is dark . <EOS>
yeah yeah , uh s i think some i think it's good idea , yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> like when you when you buy a t_v_ you just ask well i'll <EOS> it's it's it's not a lot of work , <EOS> just one uh docking station where you put it in , <EOS> press start , bling bling , updated . <EOS>
uh-huh . <EOS> so if you use a rubber double curved case , you must use rubber push-buttons . <EOS> so if we're going for rubber then we have to decide for the case . <EOS> um and if we choose double curved then we have to go for rubber push-buttons . <EOS> so it's a constraint . <EOS>
it's twelve point f <EOS> yeah the normal batteries would be the cheapest <EOS> i'd presume then it would actually be the the solar charging ones , <EOS> um but the <EOS> it's i i think they're not very resistant to dropping , <EOS> 'cause if you drop stuff <EOS> yeah <EOS> if you if you have y <EOS> the size you'd need to charge a remote wouldn't be that big <EOS> but i mean if remotes always get thrown around and stuff , so . <EOS>
oh yeah . <EOS> mm that would be good . <EOS> like a like a mobile phone ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm . <EOS> mm , yeah that would be good . <EOS> mm . <EOS> okay . so , <EOS> andrew have you had any thoughts yet about how we might market something <EOS> which there are already millions out there <EOS> and that we want to uh uh uh t take over the entire um the planet with ? <EOS>
are we ready to start ? <EOS> okay . <EOS> it's now quarter of four . <EOS> this is a f another forty minute one <EOS> so it will end at four twenty five . <EOS> okay . right . <EOS> our agenda is , as before , for me to open the meeting , <EOS> for us to go over the previous minutes , <EOS> then for the two of you to present your prototype <EOS> and for you to g um sarah present the evaluation criteria . <EOS> we then have a finance aspect , <EOS> which is a spreadsheet , an excel spreadsheet . <EOS> and i know what you're all thinking of , oh my , <EOS> um because we're only given a forty minute time period to get it all in , including the production evaluation . <EOS> so we're going to make a very fast track . <EOS> okay . um <EOS> and as you can see that's what we do next on this thing . <EOS> so the first thing i have to do is close this <EOS> so that i can get to <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> yes , yes . <EOS> th th that's very handy <EOS> i i always miss it <EOS> and on some remote controls that you can go channel up or down ins instead of retyping the number , especially when you have a lot of channels . <EOS> mm . <EOS>
one side for kids , one side for adults . <EOS> i'm not sure if that's like <EOS> yeah . <EOS> or grandma as well , you know it's like what is the mute button . <EOS> i'm not sure if it's a good idea to have a two sided remote though , <EOS> 'cause it would be very hard to use in the way that you mani manipulate it . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> okay . <EOS> um this is sort of an example of going for a s certain demographic . <EOS> um this is particularly geared towards children . <EOS> um it's very cute , <EOS> and we could probably change it to yellow , bright yellow for like a the for the company logo . <EOS> um and you have the shapes and it's very simplistic and friendly looking . <EOS> um and then the other thing that it would be able to do is just to pro be ab you program certain <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> um , fifty percent of users only use ten percent of the buttons , <EOS> so again a big design issue there . <EOS> um and possibly we can also cut back on cost if we don't have so many functions actually on the remote control . um <EOS> the biggest frustrations that people found with regard to personal preferences were um something that you you mentioned earlier , uh remote controls are often lost in the room , <EOS> it's a slipping down the back of the sofa type of thing , uh <EOS> fifty percent were were particularly frustrated by that . <EOS> uh thirty four percent of people take said they take too much time to learn to use <EOS> and i think that ties in with the um the previous finding of people only using ten percent of the buttons , <EOS> they just can't be bothered to learn about the other functions . <EOS> um , um slightly more than a quarter of people said it was bad for uh repetitive strain injury . <EOS> you know those small movements of the remote control can lead to kind of shoulder and elbow problems . <EOS> um the vast majority of the thirty five and under age group would like um a liquid crystal display and speech recognition , <EOS> again that was to aid i think in uh when they've lost the actual remote control , some kind of speech recognition . <EOS> something we didn't put to them , but which i'm thinking of now is um even if perhaps the lost control can give off a bleep every now and again til you find it or a flashing light , possibly . <EOS> um , that trend reverses in the older age groups . <EOS> so thirty fives and unders who would like those two features , that kind of evens out thirty five to forty five <EOS> and in the older age group it kind of reverses , <EOS> they're not so bothered with this . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> um which isn't really too many . <EOS> that'll be quite easy to make a user guide for a fourteen button remote . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> well we've we've got um that it's remote for t_v_ only otherwise project would become too complex with uh which would endanger the time to market was one of the considerations . <EOS> i'm i don't know d did you have that information behind the marketing , <EOS> or was i meant to give you that information ? <EOS>
uh <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> we have the alarm system . <EOS> yeah <EOS> the bu <EOS> when you press the alarm system , the lights behind the and it'll vibra <EOS> it <EOS> yeah <EOS> l lights on and , or flash as well . <EOS> but i mean it's not obviously obvious from the outside that that's gonna happen 'cause you can't s particularly see an alarm . <EOS>
oh okay . no it's easy . <EOS> so that's uh <EOS> is that is that the advanced chip ? <EOS> yeah . yeah . <EOS> otherwise you would have a simple chip , just for pressing buttons . but we need more . <EOS> advanced chip . okay . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> right . <EOS> um so this is kind of the the bear essentials that we need to have in our remote control , <EOS> because it it defines the uh <EOS> okay . <EOS> so can we make them to pretty much any size we like or is there a minimum or ? <EOS>
well <EOS> do we w <EOS> like <EOS> i think we're supposed to have one that we do it for . <EOS> oh <EOS> okay . okay . <EOS> that was <EOS> i was a little vague on what exactly i'm supposed to do , <EOS> but let me <EOS> i have to like write something on the whiteboard , so . <EOS>
yeah yeah . <EOS> and volume control . <EOS> yeah <EOS> that that usually uh like here , here , here , here . <EOS> so you have up and down for the for the channels , and left and right for the volume uh <EOS> yeah i <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> and so depending what the uh the overhead uh costs are will determine uh how many units we're uh looking to sell or projecting to sell at this point in time . <EOS> so um <EOS> experience with remote control , first ideas . new remote . <EOS> so i guess we're looking at um having a discussion at this point in time <EOS> to help uh you um folks design our our new model as it were . <EOS> so uh any any thoughts ? <EOS>
right . <EOS> um it like wants to be simple but it's not like totally totally simple , <EOS> so i'm gonna give it a two . <EOS> i'm give it a three i guess . <EOS> i'll give it a two . <EOS> three . <EOS> alright , <EOS> and fashionable ? <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> i think that was the main aim , one of the main aims that we had . <EOS> s give it a one . <EOS> one , <EOS> 'kay . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> um , do the controls now match the operating behaviour of the users ? <EOS>
hmm . <EOS> on the remote mot control itself . mm . <EOS> uh as uh a in any case it's it's not used , well very much , but it's it is still used . um <EOS> mm . <EOS> um . <EOS> further yes we must think , uh do we stay uh to to television only , the television as we as we all know it with with broadcasting signals and you can't go back <EOS> uh huh , <EOS> or do we uh uh go further as matthew indicated by supporting uh uh recording uh devices ? <EOS>
bit of feedback . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> as the colour the <EOS> and if you think about easy to use buttons , we have to , well we have to make it the shape so that it's easy to hold f for both hands , <EOS> but also that you can reach the buttons with your thumb , if you hold the machine . <EOS>
ah , okay . <EOS> where where is it ? <EOS> here . <EOS> yeah , that one . <EOS> yeah , that's right . <EOS> norman . <EOS> mm . <EOS> be before before writing you can uh sit <EOS> and that says what we what we said <EOS> then after that you can you can use the . yeah . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> i agree . <EOS> and you need to sort of take into light languages and then different dialects i suppose as well . <EOS> well <EOS> i myself i find , when you , h when there's something like spee speech recognition . <EOS> like uh you call on the phone and you try to change your telephone or power or something . sometimes they have a a speech recognition on the other end , <EOS> and you say one for this , <EOS> and you find yours , like you said , saying the same thing over and over and over . <EOS>
i think it feels good . <EOS> i think so too . <EOS> i'll give it a two . <EOS> 'kay . two . <EOS> i'll give it a one . <EOS> what do you say ? <EOS> i'd say a two . <EOS> alright , average is two . <EOS>
cat's . ca . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> i mean that's the thing is that it didn't say in the survey , you know , whether , you know , these are the people that will pay more for a more stylish remote control , <EOS> but i'm assuming , you know , yes . <EOS>
should be more bit more friendly , <EOS> yeah . <EOS> friendly on the eye . <EOS> 'kay . <EOS> supplements . that's okay . <EOS> where's my mouse ? <EOS> then we've got a general idea of the concepts and the materials we're going to use . so now <EOS> for the next meeting uh we'll have to look at the look-and-feel design . <EOS> it's important that the corporate design image uh is going to be in the remote . <EOS> so check out the corporate website maybe . <EOS> the user interface design , it's the same story . <EOS> and product evaluation . <EOS> so the industrial designer and user interface designer are going to work together on this one . <EOS> but you're going to get your instructions i think sended by the coach . <EOS> so <EOS> just um i will put these um minutes on the in the folder . <EOS>
okay , so <EOS> uh that wraps it up ? <EOS> everybody knows uh what to do ? <EOS> well <EOS> i wrote it down here . i wrote it down here what to do um . <EOS> the next meeting is once again in thirty minutes . <EOS> um here are the individual actions , <EOS> and especially notice that uh the industrial designer and the user interface designer are going to work together on a prototype drawing on a smart board , <EOS> and of course to all four of us uh specific instructions will be emailed by our personal coach . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> oh okay . oh yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> oh okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> that's that that that that's their uh their view . <EOS> okay , so uh <EOS> we can all give some thought to that uh for for the next meeting , <EOS> thank you very much indeed . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm . <EOS> uh mm . <EOS> y yeah , yeah . <EOS> because you are using because you are using bluetooth , if some people have p_d_a_ they can use their p_d_a_ to control the t_v_ if they want to , right ? <EOS>
yeah , afterwards , if <EOS> yeah . yeah . <EOS> if it's a new trend . <EOS> okay . <EOS> so <EOS> yeah that's that fine . <EOS> so we can celebrate now . <EOS> that's our new product . <EOS> champagne , mister baba . <EOS> we should celebrate . <EOS>
simple design . <EOS> it's what consumers want . <EOS> okay <EOS> it's almost like , houston , we have a product here . <EOS> problem is obviously gonna be cost . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> okay , <EOS> i also have a f very simple presentation , <EOS> because for the marketing point you have to see what the consumers want . <EOS>
i mean uh what type of product would you think could we make this more interesting ? <EOS> less fancy . <EOS> mm we i i know something , we need more cakes , more biscuits on the table while we have meetings . <EOS> yeah and also more well uh more seriously i think it's it's a good idea to have uh clear clear points whenever we do a meeting <EOS> uh prior to the meeting to have uh well a list with the points who will be discussed or things like that , <EOS>
okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> um for m for me uh the marketing expert , the user requirements uh specification , do i need to think as a user , <EOS> a as a a a only the looks and the <EOS> no , <EOS> what you want to do with it . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> they've got no commitments and <EOS> alright . <EOS> usually not a car and all of those things . <EOS> you don't normally have a car , <EOS> yeah , so . <EOS> you're still learning to drive actually , <EOS> so that just costs more than a car , <EOS> but yeah . um so <EOS> i mean like it is an age group to target , really , i think . <EOS>
but as the day went along we had more idea of what we were doing . <EOS> um room for creativity ? <EOS> there was that . <EOS> um i think we tried a lotta different things <EOS> and um i think it was um interesting as you guys brought up more um information and studies that we were right on with a lot of those things . <EOS> um you guys worked together well as a team . <EOS> and um the means ? <EOS> which was the whiteboard and the pens . <EOS>
and i have come up with the <EOS> management come with the new proposal , <EOS> okay , <EOS> and i have to discuss a few points on this . <EOS> uh both says new insights in the aim of your project . <EOS> uh the one is uh the teletext becomes uh outmoded , okay because if uh because of the computer systems and the new technology . <EOS> so <EOS> we don't need to consider really about the teletext all in our new project design . <EOS> and the second one is about uh the remote control . <EOS> should be used only for the t_v_ . <EOS> that's what our uh management says . <EOS> and the third point , it's very very important to establish our uh marketing or uh corporate image , okay , with this new project or new product . <EOS> okay . <EOS>
user interface defin designer , yes . <EOS> right . <EOS> this is the agenda for today's meeting . as you can see , w opening , acquaintance , tool training , project plan discussion , and closing . <EOS> um , we already got n through opening , and partially through acquaintance . <EOS>
so <EOS> elephants are big , strong and gentle , <EOS> and they have great memories , <EOS> and they begin with the letter e_ , just like ebenezer . <EOS> brilliantly done . <EOS> thank you . <EOS> tarik , would you like to have a shot at a bit of artistry ? <EOS>
looks like a p_d_a_ ? <EOS> um and if you look at a lot of the universal remotes out um on the market , <EOS> i know we're working on television remote , but a lot of the universal remotes out there have uh have these l_c_d_ screens <EOS> which kind of helps when you're using multiple uh devices i suppose because you can have multiple kind of functions d different functions on the screen at different times . <EOS> but um the thing that i find most interesting about this remote control , and it's kind of difficult to uh to see in the slide , but it has a scroll wheel on it , <EOS> which is kind of like uh a mouse scroll wheel , <EOS> which i think is it's a really kind of important design aspect <EOS> um is it's <EOS> 'cause the thing is what a what we the presen this presentation we had is what we want the remote control to actually do . <EOS> and obviously the the simplest thing that a remote control does is it just change the change the channel . <EOS> now um <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> it's more expensive according to the design people . <EOS> you have to get a an advanced chip if you wanna have a screen in , <EOS> which is more expensive than the regular chip , which is more expensive than the minimal . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay so this is quite easy . <EOS> there is not that much constraints . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> um we just have to define the processing power that we need uh <EOS> especially if we want to do some uh speech recognition , <EOS> in that case that mean that we are going to use more for simple <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> uh-huh . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> w sort of <EOS> great . <EOS> um as for the energy source um , you know , almost every remote control uses just batteries , <EOS> but we don't have to be limited by that . <EOS> we can use a hand-dynamo . <EOS> um i don't know what that means , <EOS> we crank it ? <EOS>
mm-hmm . yep . <EOS> so that's pretty much it for our presentation actually . <EOS> that's your uh prototype model ? <EOS> okay , that's good , thank you very much . <EOS> so any comments or uh <EOS> yeah . <EOS> well , the prototype is is very well within the design and ideas that we've we've talked about on the previous meetings . <EOS> now it goes into this next phase as the financial uh marketing uh <EOS>
hmm . <EOS> interesting . <EOS> m maybe <EOS> is there an option that we can have that off or on <EOS> so a person can select like <EOS> mm . good call . <EOS> choose it . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i am sure that we could do that . <EOS> um , of course <EOS>
uh hello , we're great . <EOS> okay , fashionable ? <EOS> um one . <EOS> at the moment , no . <EOS> no . <EOS> i mean like no , i think it's very fashionable . <EOS> no . <EOS> me too , very chic . <EOS> i thi i would give it a one . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> is that what everybody got ? <EOS> okay . <EOS> um . <EOS> so we're gonna have like individual work and then a meeting about it . <EOS> and repeat that process three times . <EOS> um and at this point we get try out the whiteboard over there . <EOS> um . <EOS> so uh you get to draw your favourite animal and sum up your favourite characteristics of it . <EOS> so who would like to go first ? <EOS>
but then i think you you <EOS> first of all i i think this is not uh functionality that it is going to be instead of using the buttons . <EOS> it's on top of using the button . <EOS> no , in no not only speech , yeah . <EOS>
rubble double double . <EOS> no , but na le you see , you've got , okay , the energy that's one thing , <EOS> i'll have a big mac , please . <EOS> then you have the case is uh , whether it's flat or curved . <EOS> and that's <EOS> we don't care if it's rub rubber or not , <EOS> but then we've decided that we going for rubber for the case material . <EOS> so if we've chosen rub rubber and if now we have the choice for the case whether it's flat , single curved or double curved . <EOS> and i'm just saying if it if we choose it to be double curved then we need to go <EOS> i dunno why , <EOS> but we need to go for uh rubber push-buttons . <EOS>
okay , <EOS> so we use that . <EOS> yes . <EOS> yep . <EOS> i just say <EOS> can you s just say it again , <EOS> because i was just looking <EOS> there's just a short <EOS> uh okay . well uh <EOS> y you have this chip . <EOS> that's uh when the circuit is closed , it produces the pattern . <EOS> but uh ma basically for uh brands of t_v_ these patterns are different . <EOS>
is that right ? <EOS> yeah , about four fifteen , yeah . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> until about four fifteen . <EOS> so yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay , so . <EOS> go for it . <EOS> do you want <EOS> so , you said um <EOS> are are we starting with the the <EOS> so will you maybe start with like the mm the shape and things <EOS> and and then i will explain the the user interface th uh things , like the buttons and the scrolling things and <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> um i dunno um talking about vo <EOS> i mean obviously if you've got voice recognition then you can do it in that way <EOS> because it'll recognise the voice <EOS> and you can give it a command , <EOS> a set command whatever that happened to be . <EOS> but you've then got the point if if you're not going with uh voice recognition then <EOS>
yeah but that's going to be expensive , you know . <EOS> we had some problems going to twelve euros and uh i dunno . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> . <EOS> i think it it would be interesting to just to see if we can if people will buy this one , and maybe add some features to it after yeah . <EOS>
should . <EOS> i think so . <EOS> 'kay <EOS> i guess we can probably call that meeting to an end for the most part . <EOS> cool . <EOS> i think that's a closer . <EOS> has it been forty minutes or whatever ? <EOS> this has been long enough . <EOS>
just about right <EOS> l_e_g_o_ lego . <EOS> my leg . <EOS> right , okay . <EOS> um well do you wanna um just individually say what you think about about these four points and <EOS> or not those four points , my four points , <EOS> sorry , <EOS> forgotten that . <EOS> you got a different uh <EOS>
okay . <EOS> and when you try to open it , it will be opened easily . <EOS> so you you can be sure that it will not be open while you're uh while while uh you are commonly using uh buttons on the banana . <EOS> okay . <EOS> and what would be the matter here of the first layer i mean ? <EOS> mm . likes . soft plastic , or <EOS>
hmm-mm . <EOS> then we have the the user interface . <EOS> oops . <EOS> and the main components in there are the the th the chip <EOS> that actually has the intelligence of the machine <EOS> that translates button presses into a message , <EOS> which it then transfers to some sending mechanism , <EOS> which encodes it <EOS> and sends the message to the receiver . <EOS> so <EOS> those are the basic things <EOS> that we've got to get in for our twelve euros fifty . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> got those notes . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> thank you . <EOS> one thing that , uh , we're going to do is become more acquainted with the , the tools that we have access to for our project . <EOS> um , one of them is our whiteboard . <EOS> and , um , as a sort of team-building moment , um , i , i'd like us to , um , try out the whiteboard by expressing our favourite animal and the charac characteristics of that animal . <EOS> um , why that , why that should be your favourite animal . <EOS> so , um , i , <EOS> i'm assuming that we should do that now . <EOS>
sample , yeah , this one . <EOS> yes , this one . okay . <EOS> case ? <EOS> um , <EOS> so <EOS> curved . double curved <EOS> yeah right . <EOS> it's uh <EOS> i see i <EOS> double curve . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> it's gonna be more than just the biggest case , definitely . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> on the and on the <EOS> yeah . <EOS> and if you want to target <EOS> yeah <EOS> if we we wish to to sell four millions of this , i think for this audience we need absolutely the l_c_d_ screen . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> voice activation might not be the best . <EOS> i would say scra i'd say scrap that straight off . <EOS> uh . <EOS> um okay , so we've basically <EOS> we've decide we've d <EOS> we've decided that it's gonna be , you know uh , we're going for a basic television remote . <EOS> it's gotta be safe to use , <EOS> it's gotta look cool . <EOS> it's gotta be cheap . <EOS> s um . <EOS>
'kay next . <EOS> so double curved is like this , this , this , or <EOS> no it means curved in two dimensions . <EOS> so uh w single curved ? uh let's say would be a b square box , but then with curves on one dimension . <EOS> and double curved would means that it would have curves curves in every direction . like three d_ . yeah . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> . <EOS> we're under budget . <EOS> that's cool . <EOS> yeah . yeah . <EOS> and we're actua actually making a better profit than we expected . <EOS> this is all very very good . <EOS> the bosses will be very pleased . <EOS> okay , let's just save this so i can e-mail it to you . uh . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> as he models the <EOS> it doesn't get much fancier . <EOS> sure . <EOS> and we could do whatever we like with the l_ l_c_d_ . <EOS> yeah <EOS> let's just assume it's a good l_c_d_ display . <EOS> maybe i was panicking for no reason . <EOS>
uh this is just production cost , it is not uh advertising cost , it's not transportation cost uh <EOS> yes , so still uh we have twelve point five euro . <EOS> and that will inflate quite a bit the cost of the uh the cost of the unit for the company . <EOS> so to come up with what the company wants is a fifty million pound profit , we're gonna have to go a long ways . <EOS>
we we could go for the for the for the for the for a simple chip , <EOS> but then we can't have the the speech recognition , <EOS> yes ? yes ? <EOS> no we cannot , yeah . <EOS> so <EOS> so so <EOS> w when we w a <EOS> this would this would be cutting the speech recognition . <EOS>
you use it and it works . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> well <EOS> personally i don't think that older people like to shake their remote control before they use it . <EOS> nah . <EOS> yeah . that's true . <EOS> and besides that you mentioned it would make the docking station obsolete . <EOS> and i think our docking station could be one of the marketing issues with which we can um <EOS>
can i just jump in slightly there ? <EOS> that would suggest the double curved design's probably going to be most appropriate , then . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yes , absolutely . <EOS> um , basi basically what i basically what the what be having um , i would say , the the whole thing articulated at two points , <EOS> so that if you if you're handing it from a lef uh left or right handed user you can adjust it <EOS> so that the um the l_c_ the l_c_d_ and the uh <EOS>
i'd quite like a sort of uh snowman type shape . <EOS> a snowman shape ? <EOS> um so a p sort of larger bit sits in your hand , and then you got maybe another bubble at the top for just any other function you need . <EOS> uh-huh . <EOS> that's quite a distinctive shape , <EOS> that would be good <EOS> wouldn't it . <EOS>
yeah . or ma yeah . <EOS> or maybe parents they can for forget where they put it or , <EOS> so mayb better if you have all this in the same <EOS> in the same set , yeah , <EOS> and and individual buttons to make them work . <EOS>
so , we need to examine each element separately , <EOS> but we're designing a full thing , <EOS> so you wanna keep it integrated as a whole . <EOS> the main elements of remote controls in general , and therefore ours as well , are the case , the buttons , the circuit board with the chip and the battery . <EOS> these are all things that we had sort of addressed before , <EOS> but i'm gonna take each one a little bit separately here <EOS> as we figure out what they should be made of <EOS> and what they should look like . <EOS> the case , <EOS> uh the options that i've gotten from headquarters about what we can do , <EOS> um there's there's the shape of a case , we could do a flat sh a flat case , a curved case or maybe even a double double-curved case . <EOS> i haven't seen any pictures of what this exactly looks like yet , <EOS> just keep that in mind , <EOS> but these are the options that we have from manufacturing <EOS> and we can make our case out of plastic , the m the main base will be plastic , <EOS> but we have all these sort of fashion and technological elements we can add in , wood , latex , titanium , rubber or other coloured types of plastic . <EOS> that would be our case . <EOS> um buttons , <EOS> for buttons we have um pushbuttons , <EOS> which is what real reaction uses the most often , <EOS> but we also have scror scroll wheels , <EOS> which can have integrated pushbuttons , <EOS> or we could go all high-tech <EOS> and have an l_ l_c_d_ screen . <EOS> um circuit board and chip we can have a simple one , a regular one or an advanced one , <EOS> depending on what our other needs are . <EOS> and then battery i think is where things get most exciting . <EOS> we're talking about long-life batteries here . <EOS> um we can we can have your sort of basic double a_ batteries , <EOS> but we also have these options of um using a kinetic battery , <EOS> like are used in high-tech watches , <EOS> where you just have to move it a little bit to get it to power up . <EOS>
good in in <EOS> flip it round in ninety degree a hundred and eighty degrees and have it up and down . <EOS> an upside-down v_ . <EOS> i'm just gonna check so i do this right . <EOS> um . what did they say ? <EOS> so that would show that volume was going up , whereas the one underneath would see the volume going down . <EOS>
that's in the shape of a fruit , like a <EOS> yeah . <EOS> sticker sort of ? <EOS> because i was thinking if you have a cover for the squashy bit , <EOS> like a <EOS> this is just <EOS> okay . <EOS> say that's the s say that's the squashy bit . squashy . <EOS>
very nice . <EOS> and the the simplest functions would be um almost identical to an ipod , <EOS> where that one way ch through channels , that way th other way through channels . <EOS> volume up and down . <EOS> and then to access the more complicated functions you'd you sorta go , you press that and go through the menus . <EOS> it's that that simple . <EOS> that just represents the infrared uh beam . <EOS> that's a simple on and off switch . <EOS> um i don't know , <EOS> we could use the voice . <EOS> t that blue bits should be yellow , <EOS> d that that'd be where the batteries would be i suppose . <EOS> and um <EOS> that's about it . <EOS> it's as simple as you , we could make it really . <EOS> is there anything you want to add ? <EOS>
oh . <EOS> if we can still make that then <EOS> yeah , <EOS> but it doesn't have to be red . <EOS> it's just to indicate something's on . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> that it's working . <EOS> that it's not not the batteries are low . <EOS>
yeah sure , of course you need uh a settings button , uh or a settings option for the remote control . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> but isn't idea to use uh uh what you said , uh normal on and off button for the t_v_ , <EOS> that you don't have to use a <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> i reckon one problem with speech recognition is <EOS> um i've actually seen one of them used <EOS> and uh the technology that was in that one wasn't particularly amazing , <EOS> so you end up yelling at the control for hours . <EOS> channel up . <EOS>
yes . <EOS> yeah , the the the difference be between uh beautiful and fancy uh look-and-feel is uh the the the outside uh beautiful uh like the ipod or something . <EOS> and fancy's more like the mm uh f the flashing lights and the colours and and that kind of stuff . <EOS> the leds . <EOS>
yeah , okay . <EOS> all right ? <EOS> then , tool training try out the white board , <EOS> participant can draw their favourite animal . <EOS> does anybody want to go and see how the white board works ? <EOS> so that in case we have to , in the next meeting , present something on the white board . <EOS> you wanna go eileen and <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah <EOS> and then you could have <EOS> oh but you still would have to have the logo on every new case , <EOS> but you could have like pink cases for girls and red ones and things like that . <EOS> yeah , that's true . <EOS>
very good . <EOS> okay , and if you need uh any coordination in between uh compared to the maybe the some technical vendors or commercial vendors , okay , depends if you want to have some uh uh marketing plan or technical plan , okay , so you let me know . <EOS> okay , i can coordinate , <EOS> or maybe uh , you are my coordinator , am i right ? <EOS>
okay . <EOS> so <EOS> f <EOS> just go through onto the whiteboard i guess . <EOS> not sure how this is gonna come out . <EOS> so <EOS> the first one was really very far below budget , <EOS> would you want to take the price down of the end product according to that <EOS> or just have the high profit on it ? <EOS> 'cause if we're only going to make it for eight euros then we have a <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> will have come in contact with that kind of use . <EOS> s yeah . <EOS> so they'd be able to use that um , <EOS> as i said i think i i'd presume it would come up on the screen . <EOS> um so there you go . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> a fashion fashion remote . <EOS> i think there's there's certainly a market for technology that looks cool . <EOS> and i think that's that's why companies like apple've 've 've made a lot of progress . <EOS> right . <EOS> mm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> right , <EOS> i really can't see what i'm doing , <EOS> so does anyone have a <EOS>
but now button supplements . <EOS> we don't got the button supplements . <EOS> oh , <EOS> we don't have any buttons , <EOS> so <EOS> yeah , <EOS> we need to uh <EOS> eighteen and a half , <EOS> damn . <EOS> we have to lower it with six points . <EOS>
yeah , but i can reach in uh one second i can mute it down , or or make a high volume . <EOS> are you not afraid that if you take your remote control you can move the slide and it could the the volume can go up very quickly <EOS> and it can <EOS>
oh right <EOS> it's it's from the left to the ri it's <EOS> so <EOS> you think we have to do it now ? <EOS> i d i was thinking <EOS> but i n i'm not sure now . <EOS> you can draw something which is very simple . <EOS> oh <EOS>
yes . <EOS> mm . <EOS> that's a much more trendy than a potato <EOS> one . <EOS> what are what's everyone's numbers ? <EOS> uh two . <EOS> one . <EOS> alright <EOS> um , and does the design match the appropriate behaviour ? <EOS> remember earlier we discussed that people don't use a lot of buttons , <EOS> that they use the channel flipping and the volume the most . <EOS> i think we really took that into account a lot , <EOS> so i'm gonna give it a one . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> or vice versa . <EOS> and that's really irritating . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> um the o the o the other dis design constraint i think we should bear in mind is that people are you know very much used to using a remote control one handedly , <EOS> um , so we need to make sure that e even with the joystick , you know something that can just sit comfortably in the palm of the hand <EOS> and have the joystick just controlled by the thumb . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> one more thing . <EOS> are w are we changing uh <EOS> or are they there uh backlights on the slide panel too ? <EOS> or n no back light ? <EOS> yeah ? <EOS> slide panel ? <EOS> mm . not needed . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> oh i think forget about the mirror <EOS> that was just a very quick passing thought yeah . <EOS> okay , okay . <EOS> okay , uh <EOS> would like to share something which i did here . <EOS> first thing is uh basically on design <EOS> we just took the input from the previous meeting , especially from the marketing and industrial design , to check on the customer needs and feasibility . <EOS> second is we checked into competitors , <EOS> the picture here shows one of the standard models offered by competitors here . <EOS> so y you generally see there's not much of variety <EOS> and like marketing team said uh , people need trendy , they are bored of black and white . <EOS> so you generally see rectangular shape , very monotonous kind of designs here . <EOS>
i'll go for two . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> one . <EOS> one ? <EOS> i think it's it's functional , <EOS> it's also pretty basic , <EOS> so i'll give it a two . <EOS> okay . <EOS> um functional . <EOS> i think it'll get everything done , <EOS> i think it might be a little confusing at first , <EOS> um , i don't know if that's gonna be a later one . <EOS> okay , <EOS> then i'm gonna give it a two . <EOS>
uh i made a little uh uh animation of about how a tran our uh remote controller works . <EOS> oh right . <EOS> animation . <EOS> we tel <EOS> there is something turning . <EOS> there . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> it's a little bug <EOS> it's in the in the smart board . <EOS>
they usually have the little light uh source , <EOS> i dunno what the heck they're called , <EOS> the but <EOS> yeah , the little cells <EOS> that <EOS> yeah , they have that little solar <EOS> som well some do , <EOS> i mean <EOS> th th <EOS> but there are battery ones <EOS> that um are you know , sort of permanently sealed . <EOS> in in fact i'd <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> mm . mm . yes . <EOS> this is how embedded one will <EOS> yes , <EOS> it basically is the same shape . <EOS> yeah . it's a bas basically the same thing actually . <EOS> you will be except that in this c <EOS> mm-hmm . mm . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> let's go ahead and start off with your presentations . <EOS> who would like to go first ? <EOS> just trying to move mine right now . <EOS> okay . <EOS> um courtney would you mind starting us off ? <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> trend watching ? <EOS>
hand-sized . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i don't think you need a <EOS> not not huge , but <EOS> but definitely not well i don't know . <EOS> it can't be that hard to put some kind of a noise on it . <EOS> no , it can't be , uh-uh . <EOS>
right . <EOS> right . <EOS> right . <EOS> no i understand that . <EOS> so technologically , if i understand it , uh t_v_s t_v_ remote's working exactly the same way as video remotes and d_v_d_ remotes . <EOS> all you need to do is train them to the individual one , <EOS> all you need to do is is know the the f like some four-digit code . <EOS> so saying that it works with all t_v_s is equivalent to saying that it'll work with d_v_d_s and other things . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> mm , yeah , that's true . <EOS> oh . exactly . exactly . <EOS> yeah . good point . <EOS> so yeah i think with a good marketing scheme um and the personalisation options , it'll <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i would give it a two still though . <EOS>
yeah , that's right , yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> therefore it's a good idea , <EOS> but maybe it's expensive . <EOS> maybe uh use it as a separate option . sell it uh separately . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> you can <EOS> yeah , <EOS> you can buy it with it . <EOS>
well <EOS> it's <EOS> it was just a thought . <EOS> so <EOS> i'm , i u <EOS> i would find it handy , i think , when you just press one button and you get on six six six . <EOS> yeah , okay . <EOS> but um how can you remember what uh channel uh connects to what favourite button ? <EOS>
and these things whoa . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> and let's not forget the sexy dual microphones everyone gets to wear . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> and big brother . <EOS> big brother . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> 'kay , have we found any new ideas through this process ? <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> okay um well <EOS> i don't think i have anything more to add at the moment . <EOS> um i think the best is to go to work . <EOS> whoa . <EOS> is that you <EOS> or <EOS> alright . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , yeah . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> oh . <EOS> no . <EOS> um . <EOS> that's nicer . <EOS> i think it's nicer to have a drawing 'cause it's neater . <EOS>
uh . <EOS> what kind is it ? <EOS> um he's a mixture of uh various things . <EOS> um and what do i like about him , um <EOS> that's just to suggest that his tail wags . <EOS> um he's very friendly and cheery and always pleased to see you , <EOS> and very kind of affectionate <EOS> and um <EOS>
okay . <EOS> giraffe's yellow . <EOS> uh it needs some uh some yellow uh oh format . <EOS> can you use one blank sheet per drawing ? or <EOS> so y you must save it at the end <EOS> and then <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah <EOS> you can press the next button , <EOS> which is uh <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i'll show you . <EOS> yeah . in file menu . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> yes well <EOS> maybe matthew can can give some more information on the <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm . <EOS> voila . <EOS> yep and that's the presentation . <EOS> okay good , <EOS> that's very clear . <EOS> yeah very clear . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> 'kay . um .
yeah . <EOS> iain , what do you give it ? <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah <EOS> i'd i'd give it a one . <EOS> alright <EOS> and the next is , does it integrate some notion of fruits and vegetables ? <EOS> well , <EOS> is it gonna be yellow ? <EOS>
i wanna see the output files from these um , from the digital paper . <EOS> i wanna see wh wh what my my handwriting looks like digitized <EOS> because my handwriting is crap . <EOS> i mean , <EOS> just to see what it looks like in p_d_f_ format or something . <EOS>
yeah , it's true . <EOS> uh . <EOS> mm . <EOS> was pretty cool tack though . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm . <EOS> i am disappointed i didn't get a note back from my personal coach . <EOS> definitely . <EOS> as you write your personal coach . <EOS>
i dunno . <EOS> i'll bet first in volume maybe . i dunno . <EOS> no we can we can do multiple scroll wheels but <EOS> well i d i like the idea of basically focusing the <EOS> my personal preference is focusing the p the product on the idea of the uh the case the the uh dock to put it in to to charge it . <EOS> we can target like environmentally friendly ideas , that sorta things . <EOS> it s i m makes it easy to market , <EOS> it's easy to differentiate the product , yeah so . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> that's my idea . <EOS> i think definitely doing something different <EOS> yeah . <EOS> is a good idea . <EOS> mm . <EOS> i mean maybe design something , that's sort of like <EOS> uh i suppose not everybody's everybody's hand's the same , <EOS> but something that would maybe fit in the hand easier . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> or we can just go back to the previous slide uh where we ha we have a few updates . <EOS> so i mean in the product design you could just amend it to make some few changes <EOS> according to fruit and vegetable <EOS> or a spongy touch <EOS> without l_c_d_ and without speech recognition . <EOS> even then our product is going to be very good . <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
they're on top ? <EOS> yeah , just th th th other buttons like text t_v_ . put that on the button bottom . <EOS> because uh you can't hold it . you can't hold it th the control and push the buttons . <EOS> you mean uh these to the low ? <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> okay , sure . <EOS> at this stage we still have no no target audience <EOS> or <EOS> i think the target audience is pretty much anybody under the age of say maybe sixty or something ludicrous . <EOS> um the reason i'm saying that is we're just looking at a a replacement remote control , <EOS> something that's stylish , <EOS> so maybe you're even just maybe you're narrowing down your target audience simply by saying <EOS>
mm . <EOS> red for power , um arrows for different volume ups and downs and channels ups and downs and what not . <EOS> and uh perhaps even adding in some stupid little jokes with the voice recognition idea <EOS> like perh mm for instance my toastie maker that i got from my bank <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> i think we have to design one product <EOS> and then the company can take it wherever they want to uh <EOS> in the sense that they can make it smaller , or they can make it bigger or they can change the features slightly , um . <EOS>
so is this uh an indian or an african elephant , <EOS> 'cause you haven't drawn the ears ? <EOS> there are two kind of uh <EOS> yeah , they are very different , indian and african elephants . <EOS> so indian elephant is having one bump , i think , and the african have two . <EOS> and then there's a difference in the trunk of the animals , <EOS> these elephants who are indian and <EOS> so at some <EOS> for some elephants it's the trunk is having one <EOS> do we have some message there ? <EOS>
just beeps ? <EOS> or maybe you want to phone him . <EOS> but that's ex that's expensive . uh . <EOS> yeah yeah yeah . <EOS> since now all <EOS> yeah ? <EOS> yeah , <EOS> especially the power , it really consumes <EOS> because it should be all the time on <EOS> and <EOS>
um , i don't know what these mean because i didn't actually make the slide-show . <EOS> experience with remote control . <EOS> so i guess we have to reflect on our experiences with remote controls to decide what um we would like to see in a convenient , practical , nice remote control . <EOS> um so do we have any initial ideas for uh how this remote control should be designed or formatted or the the buttons it should have . <EOS>
yeah , of course . <EOS> i'm just trying to point out that i think that your evaluation and redesign turnaround time is too short <EOS> well you have no redesign not you personally , but in the project we have no redesign time and <EOS> yes . <EOS> our project doesn't um <EOS>
mm . <EOS> okay . <EOS> s <EOS> so <EOS> mm . <EOS> did y what did you work on ? <EOS> the <EOS> um evaluation criteria . <EOS> i've got a presentation . <EOS> okay . <EOS> do you wanna <EOS> okay . i think that's <EOS> so i need where's the cable ? <EOS> right what happens is we have to um decide whether this this whole this whole project we've been working on actually um meets the standards we were set at the start . <EOS> um . <EOS> right . <EOS> this doesn't <EOS> okay . <EOS> um the method is we well i've analysed the user requirements and integrated them to the trends found in marketing reports and in our company strategy marketing . <EOS> and um the findings were that we need it to look in a certain way , feel in a certain way , <EOS> and this is everything's listed down . <EOS> um , look in a certain way , feel in a certain way , it has to be technologically innovative and it has to be easy to use . <EOS> these are all things we looked at at the start , <EOS> um and criteria that have to be met . <EOS> we have to use a table , <EOS> i'll show you that later , <EOS> together to decide whether it meets the standards . <EOS> and we we have therefore in total um we have five we have eleven points according to which this should be evaluated . <EOS> and um the cri well basically the findings are the same as the evaluation criteria . <EOS> i would like to show you the table we have to use . <EOS> um . <EOS> no . <EOS> this is the table . <EOS> can you see this here ? <EOS>
yeah <EOS> it could be on that <EOS> yeah , okay . <EOS> yeah on that as well so . <EOS> s <EOS> so are we talking of a concept of a rechargeable something on the remote ? <EOS> yeah <EOS> some sort of docking station or <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
well <EOS> there are universal d um um remotes <EOS> and they all have a functionality for all the t_v_s , <EOS> uh so this wouldn't be a extra feature to incorporate the men menus of these . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> but they <EOS>
wow . <EOS> nice . <EOS> 'cause <EOS> nice . <EOS> bad religion ? <EOS> yeah , <EOS> that's the music i grew up listening to . <EOS> of course . <EOS> yeah yeah , yeah . <EOS> oh , <EOS> now i can think of so many other ones . <EOS>
spongy 'kay . <EOS> okay , yeah , yeah . <EOS> i dunno . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> but the problem is which kind of material do you need to to be spongy ? <EOS> yeah <EOS> thi this is this would be like um <EOS> pla <EOS> plastic-like , but rubber , mayb maybe , you know , rubber-like uh <EOS>
i don't mind going first . <EOS> 'kay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> um do you have a powerpoint or no ? <EOS> yeah , <EOS> it's in the should be in the m project . <EOS> okay . <EOS> do you want us to do our powerpoints now or <EOS>
if you . <EOS> mm . <EOS> the the industrial design side . <EOS> oh <EOS> i think it's it's remote controls are kind of a unique object <EOS> 'cause it's you depend on them so much , <EOS> but you don't i i it's <EOS> you sort of just assume they're always gonna work , <EOS> you don't think of them as a comp <EOS> like a computer can break down <EOS> and you're kinda like oh well fair enough <EOS> there's all these complex things going on , <EOS> it's gonna <EOS> something's gonna get messed up eventually . <EOS> they they just need to be very very dependable <EOS> because people sort of take them for granted <EOS> and then if your remote control breaks it's god forbid you actually get up and manually change the channel <EOS> it just <EOS> it needs to be very effective , very always dependable . uh <EOS> i don't think we should make it too small <EOS> i 'cause i think it needs to <EOS> it can't be too big like you were saying big an and huge and um awkward , <EOS> but also if you make it too small kinda like you know how mobile phones are getting smaller and smaller um , it's just gonna end up under a couch cushion somewhere and um yeah . <EOS>
wow . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> alright . <EOS> kinetic . double curved . <EOS> this is what we're looking for . <EOS> and th that means curved in both dire dire uh dimensions . <EOS> not only like this but it has to be <EOS> exactly . <EOS> it has to be kind of instead of the playstation , the module . it has to be like the the game cube , you know , <EOS> where your thumbs would be laying in the instrument and it has to be nice to hold . and <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> this is where we talk about um properties , materials , user-interface and trend-watching . <EOS> etcetera . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> so i think we've touched on a few things to do with that already , <EOS> but we'll just go over it . <EOS> um <EOS> the minutes from the last time . <EOS> um we had a couple of um changes in our plans in that we couldn't use teletext , it wasn't gonna be a control for everything <EOS> um and that we had to incorporate the image of the company into it somehow . <EOS> um <EOS> we have decided on a leaving out the voice recognition , <EOS> we've decided on there being a flip design <EOS> and um a different shape from what's normal . <EOS> we were thinking a shell , but something along those lines , <EOS> just a different shape from what's normal , um . <EOS> you were going to look into the rechargeable batteries <EOS>
okay , here is our project . <EOS> we're gonna make a new remote control that's um original , trendy and also user-friendly . <EOS> and how we are going to do it is each of us is going to um <EOS> we're gonna have discuss the functional design first , how is it gonna be used , what's the actual goal here , it has to operate t_v_ , blah blah blah . <EOS> and we're going to do individual work on that and then meet . <EOS> same thing with conceptual design . <EOS> just the basic overview of the project and then we're going to do individual work , meet . <EOS> that's pretty much the the whole process for today . <EOS> and then the detailed design , just more in-depth , get the actual schematics of the remote . <EOS>
yeah , that's a great idea . well done . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> third most important aspect uh is it's easy to use . <EOS> and i think we've all um worked that out . <EOS> um okay , in the fashion , how it's supposed to look . <EOS> next year's fashion i very much in fruit and vegetables are thm are like the theme for cloths , shoes and furniture . <EOS> so next year people will be buying , <EOS> i found this really funny , <EOS> you know , strawberry shaped chairs , <EOS>
two . <EOS> maybe it will . uh . <EOS> t <EOS> mm . i think i it would , could be , could get lost . <EOS> you think it could lost <EOS> two . <EOS> mm . yeah . <EOS> i mean it's not fully it's not fully like you can't say <EOS> i mean , it's not a one , definitely . <EOS>
right , <EOS> okay . <EOS> right , <EOS> i think we need to make a a decision here . <EOS> uh given that the company wants this on the market quickly and cheaply , <EOS> that would appear to uh effectively constrain us to an existing chip and thus therefore conventional button technology . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> okay . mm . <EOS> mm-hmm . uh but that's a that's a design decision that we can make . <EOS> 'kay . i do think that um one of the important features for a remote is seeing a menu and seeing what's on . <EOS> um and so <EOS> like favourite channels is is applicable , <EOS> but i think th that you do need to have some kind of function where it's um you have t you can see the title of the show or possibly a description of it . <EOS> like <EOS> i i know i use that often enough . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> and if we're talking about making something easy that sort of goes along with it <EOS> so it wouldn't be like a random thing to sort of add in . <EOS> it would be relevant to like the overall goal i think , <EOS> so <EOS>
to function it it doesn't really have to be sm uh big of course . <EOS> the microphone could be just a minor uh hole uh on the left uh button . <EOS> okay um <EOS> yeah , okay . of course . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> mm . mm , th yeah . <EOS> small . <EOS>
i'm sorry to be late . <EOS> welcome back . <EOS> welcome back everybody . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> thanks . <EOS> so this meeting agenda will be the detailed design meeting . <EOS> and uh opening and uh p_m_s of the meet minutes , <EOS> uh prototype presentation from uh christine and uh agnes . <EOS>
that might cost more though , <EOS> 'cause obviously with batteries we don't need to provide , well we provide the first batteries , but it's more , it's that's cheaper to just provide batteries . <EOS> yeah , yeah . <EOS> right . <EOS> i mean if you think about these base stations now it's essentially just a a lead with a sort of self connecting brake in it , <EOS> so i don't think it'd up up the price that much . <EOS>
ah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> so <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so um we're gonna have to have to work out what's gonna be on these other functions as as well . <EOS> so we're gonna have like two separate two separate lists , i guess . <EOS>
'kay . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yes . <EOS> has to be simple enough to <EOS> i suppose if we could get something in which was quite quick and simple that would give us an advantage over the other remotes . um . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> it would . <EOS> but probably quick and simple is primary rather than
yellow , <EOS> looks like a banana , <EOS> it's cool <EOS> it's gotta look good in the sitting room . <EOS> hide it in the fruit basket . <EOS> rather than the l_c_d_ <EOS> whereas uh more technical like like more uh people in with the latest technology it's good , <EOS> it's got an l_c_d_ screen <EOS> 's only got two buttons and a joystick . <EOS> so , <EOS> which which kind of people would be more likely to buy it ? <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah <EOS> um me uh my only reservation with it was that we basically went with yellow because it's the company's colour , <EOS> and i don't know if yellow's gonna really be a hit . <EOS> mm . <EOS> mm . <EOS>
yes . <EOS> yeah , but <EOS> yes . yep . <EOS> um-hmm . <EOS> yes . <EOS> this we are talking about one unit , okay , <EOS> so when it go into the quantity , okay , and the cost will come down . <EOS> yes . <EOS> although customisation , because this is being done , you know , the on on-order basis , it might be uh the the quantity won't m won't uh the circuit board will b you're right , would be in producing quantity , <EOS> but the cost of the case would uh be fixed at the <EOS>
after lunch . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> right um this is our conceptual design meeting , <EOS> um <EOS> i think we're slightly ahead of ourselves <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> from the last meeting , <EOS> i th i i think yeah um . <EOS> yeah , yeah i was getting that impression as well . <EOS>
probably the people technologically . <EOS> they're usually the ones that buy pointless stuff . <EOS> i think so . <EOS> i mean my mum still has not learnt how to use text messaging on her phone , <EOS> and she's had it for a long time , <EOS> you know . <EOS> she uses it to make phone calls and that's it . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> that's right . the basis station . that's right . <EOS> basis station , yeah . <EOS> uh so um <EOS> so we're going for a stylish banana shape . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> so , i guess you wanna hold like the way <EOS> the end of the banana you wanna kind of hold as ma you maybe wanna kinda hold like a gun rather than 'cause you don't want it to point kind of towards the floor . <EOS>
hmm . <EOS> yeah , tu-dum . <EOS> english is not so hard by the way . <EOS> no . <EOS> i'm breaking a world record here . <EOS> well , leader ? <EOS> oh shit . <EOS> project manager ? <EOS> we've got a problem , paul . <EOS> you do ? <EOS> yeah , you have to make a choice . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> s yeah it's safe . <EOS> and throw it . <EOS> yeah y exactly . <EOS> you don't have to be scared about bouncing it off the g floor and breaking it or whatever . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so <EOS> uh go ahead . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> so with one expensive chip we can uh implement several complicated uh or advanced features . <EOS> exactly yeah that's a very good idea , <EOS> we could have uh one main chip uh that could handle , uh it's called f_p_g_a_ chip , that could handle both uh like scrolling wheels as well as uh l_c_d_ <EOS> and <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
oh . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm ah <EOS> i i don't y you'll use it often , <EOS> because you can see on the television wh what channel you <EOS> so <EOS> oh , i'm watching uh the channel one . <EOS> okay . no , it's not <EOS> yeah , i tho i think that's not usable . <EOS> so , but uh yeah . <EOS> what other features can we put in ? <EOS>
huh . <EOS> yeah <EOS> that's not you . <EOS> no . <EOS> that's how the <EOS> wait . <EOS> this is , this is very high-powered stuff here , <EOS> double-clicking , <EOS> there we go . <EOS> so um <EOS> basically the moral of the story from our last minute uh last meeting was that um we that we had meetings from uh we had presentations done by the industrial designer , uh or from nathan , and ron and from sarah about what we can do here <EOS> um and what sort of limitations we're operating with <EOS> um uh excuse me <EOS> what limitations we're operating under , <EOS> what kind of risk we'd be looking at with some of the various approaches we were discussing <EOS> and we essentially came to the conclusion that we should develop a remote with uh voice recognition , <EOS> i_e_ that had a vaguely non-remote like shape <EOS> um because you didn't really need to use it as a remote <EOS> since you could just use your voice . <EOS> that would include some mostly just the simple design features for a television operation <EOS> but with a slide or a fold-out bay for more advanced functions for users . <EOS> um , and uh the uh uh <EOS> the u_i_d_ and the i_d_ were asked to go ahead and start developing a prototype for us to look at . <EOS> so . <EOS> that's sorted , <EOS> back to the main meet here , <EOS> um , go ahead and take it away guys . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm . <EOS> so uh wh another thing uh that can be used is that uh there can be a beeper button on the t_v_ , <EOS> so you can go and press that button and um and the remote control , wherever it is , it'll beep , <EOS> so we we can probably come to know where it is . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> i mean we have some or something , different technology but <EOS> this is it's <EOS> yeah , yeah . <EOS> but th the main idea i wanted to s i wanted to say is that um there should be a function , instead of choosing the ch t_v_ channel , there's a option you can choose , either t_v_ channels or or pr or the or the contain or the contents of the programme . <EOS> so it's more powerful . <EOS>
oh you've got . <EOS> oh what happened to the <EOS> i think that might be back to the start . <EOS> um if you grab the kind of uh slide to the left and pull it down ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> slide four <EOS> yeah . <EOS> right . <EOS> right . <EOS> sorry about that . <EOS> okay , so we've got um the working design for i_d_ . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> mm 'kay . <EOS> but i'm sh i'm sure open to to market this in either direction . <EOS> but you guys came up with a great product , <EOS> and at that cost i think it uh there's nobody else that's putting this this combination of of ingredients together . <EOS> the only limitations i see to this is that we're focused on television only . <EOS> uh that's the only that's the only drawback i see to this . <EOS> but with all of these other features i think people c one thing i'm i'm hoping for is people are not gonna even notice . <EOS> there's gonna be somebody going home and say oh sh this thing doesn't work for my d_v_d_ and my but i like these other things , so they keep it , they don't take it back . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> mm . <EOS> menu options or something to have all these other complicated voice recognition , settings , things <EOS> that you're not gonna use every day <EOS> and that a lot of people aren't gonna use <EOS> but it is an option there for this hi-tech market that sort of re is the sleek thing we're going for . <EOS>
um okay , so . <EOS> what they found is that people don't like how current remote controls are , <EOS> so you know , definitely you should be looking at something quite different . <EOS> um seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly . <EOS> uh the other twenty five percent have no fashion sense . <EOS> uh eighty percent of users would spend more to get um you know , a nice looking remote control . <EOS> um current remote controls , they don't match the user behaviour well , <EOS> as you'll see on the next slide . <EOS> um i dunno what zapping is , <EOS> but <EOS>
fo <EOS> it doesn't , yeah , yeah , yeah . <EOS> totally . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so let's not go for the <EOS> yeah , yeah . i agree . <EOS> you know . <EOS> so let's not let's uh not bother with the chip on print . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> sorry , <EOS> d did you want to say anything ? <EOS> no ? <EOS> okay . <EOS> shall we move rapidly on to uh kendra ? <EOS> uh um ra rapidly move the cable over . <EOS> uh nope , <EOS> that was it , that was it . <EOS> okay . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> mm . mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> well <EOS> hopefully some people have people coming t over to w to hang out at your house <EOS> and most people have their televisions in the living room . uh . <EOS> true . true . true . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> and and channel . <EOS> um <EOS> right . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay , <EOS> so you're gonna have um audio which is gonna be like you know your bass settings and actual volume hi <EOS> okay . <EOS>
the sales , yeah . <EOS> the <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i hope so . <EOS> no , but incorporating the three uh obviously it'd be something totally new on the market , totally different <EOS> and from <EOS> yeah . <EOS> well , already the customisability is a really good sort of new gimmick . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> okay , so <EOS> if you have some question i didn't answer ? <EOS> okay . <EOS> what's the average price of this technology then ? <EOS> well <EOS> the avera the average prices <EOS> i think that this technology will cost , i dunno , around eight euros , so . <EOS> or at least you know , the <EOS>
yeah well <EOS> yeah well that has been e that has been eliminated , so that's that's unfortunately a moot point now . mm-hmm . <EOS> well we already eliminated that . <EOS> eliminated . <EOS> now that's good from a marketing point of view , the fun the fun shape . <EOS> and that <EOS> you you say that won't add too much to the budget ? <EOS> to d the shape is uh <EOS>
mm . <EOS> no . <EOS> and they kind of respond to the turn of your body . <EOS> is it possible that when we open our flip-top shell it's a little compact mirror and when you press a button it then goes onto the phone display th uh the remote control display thing . <EOS>
r um no , i mean this is a very old one , so now with the new technology this is a a minimally small and cheap thing to make . <EOS> they gotta be <EOS> almost a key-ring . <EOS> right . <EOS> so this is what we need to have for certain . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> or should it be larger ? <EOS> larger ? <EOS> because you want to put your hands <EOS> you want <EOS> yeah . <EOS> larger i think . <EOS> but if you pu <EOS> now you can put your hand there and then you won't touch the screen . <EOS> perhaps that's best . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> it'll still not extend , <EOS> right ? <EOS> it's not up to that . <EOS> okay , there you go . <EOS> so <EOS> what favourite characteristics . uh . dogs are always friendly and loyal and fun . <EOS> a horse ? <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> nice to stock you know , stick your finger in . <EOS> um the two squared buttons are are two probably least used , menu , mute , <EOS> and then these are the numbers , <EOS> so our channel and our volume will be on either side . <EOS>
no , <EOS> and i i think a lot of people use uh teletext , still use . <EOS> no . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> and it's it's on your comp it's on your television . <EOS> it's only one button . <EOS> so i don't think it is <EOS> we definitely should use it . um <EOS>
so , <EOS> i will open our functional design meeting . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> so , <EOS> i will play role of the secretary . as also program ma manager . <EOS> so , <EOS> we will have the three presentations from the in industrial designer , user interface designer and um <EOS>
excellent . <EOS> and the second thing , some some companies they think that they should have more and more functions of the users uh or in their remote controls , <EOS> but rather than those having more functions in the remote controls we should emphasise what actually consumer want , what they operate , rather than making it too complicated . <EOS> because mostly it has been found that fifty percent of the users they use only ten percent of the buttons , <EOS> so there is no point of having ninety percent buttons making the remote controls too bulky , too complicated too expensive a because i think i believe that technology is useful only if uh the consumers they want to use it . <EOS> otherwise there is no point of having all this type of things . <EOS> so this will not only reduce the cost of our remote controls but it will increase our profit also . <EOS> so we have to take care of this fact also . <EOS>
put <EOS> okay okay . <EOS> and then . <EOS> okay and yeah <EOS> and that just basically flips between it and it'll go it sends out zero , five , and then thirty six , and then zero , one again . <EOS> yeah that's kinda cool . <EOS> i like that . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> and don't forget the <EOS> oh yeah . <EOS> um , so hi everyone . <EOS> thanks for coming to this meeting . <EOS> um well as you all know the topic of this morning's meeting is uh the fact that we're moving and we are going to get more space . <EOS> so that's a very good piece of news . <EOS> uh but we also have to find out how we use this space . <EOS> so um if you want , i'll just give a brief overview of what's happening <EOS> and then we can uh talk about , well , arranging these new uh the new office space . <EOS> so um in case you haven't seen the the documents uh let me just uh show you very briefly the the configuration of the the space . <EOS> so um well , there is nothing much to say . <EOS> well you know how many of us are are present <EOS> and you know that we are um a bit tight actually in our present location . <EOS> uh that's why actually the university finally um allocated us this uh this part of uh the unimail building . <EOS> so it's at the sixth floor . <EOS> and it's uh sort of contiguous rooms as you you can all see from uh from here . <EOS> um so the the the one p_ , two p_ , three p_ means the the number of persons . <EOS> as you can see we have several corridor um with a number of uh of uh of rooms , of one person rooms , two person room and and three person rooms . <EOS> um actually i think agnes did this nice drawing <EOS> so she even put the the view , <EOS> so we have the old town on one side , <EOS> and the mountains on the other two sides . <EOS> uh we have some bathrooms for us . <EOS> uh and a courtyard which actually means a sort of uh shaft , <EOS> because uh the court is uh down at uh the first floor . <EOS>
no . <EOS> i wondered why yours always looked so more complicated . <EOS> uh-huh huh huh . <EOS> i deleted slides . <EOS> i think i added a slide one time . <EOS> i added many slides every time <EOS> yeah . <EOS> hey <EOS> with the whole new background being innovative , yeah that was class . <EOS>
yeah but maybe yeah but maybe we we should then <EOS> because we have enough space . <EOS> h here we got uh the basic functions , <EOS> the the arrow uh yeah button . <EOS> yeah there the middle <EOS> sh sh shouldn't we integrate it ? <EOS> and then like i oh th <EOS> doh . <EOS>
yeah , i'm not sure . <EOS> um i mean those ideas i saw were just for inspiration , i think . <EOS> um yeah , i can <EOS> no i'm not sure . <EOS> glad , we're not doing this for real . <EOS> okay , well we can do some user test with scroll-wheels , right ? <EOS>
no , <EOS> because you think , why not . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> one colour . <EOS> otherwise you will never find it . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , yeah . <EOS> yeah even we can change colours , no ? <EOS> like the uh <EOS> like the phones and these things we c yeah . <EOS> at least for children like one colour and . <EOS>
i'm trying to think of a good pun that i could add there . <EOS> i know , <EOS> let's think of it like a little jingle . <EOS> um . <EOS> i like the r_r_ , <EOS> that's gonna be etched in . <EOS> yes . <EOS> hopefully not with just my fingernail at some point <EOS> but um it's quite a useful little gadget . <EOS> all thanks to iain for the design of that one . <EOS>
that's right . <EOS> i think we take with you . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> so it's kind of a stupid decision . but there's also the potential for mark there's a market here for our lost teletext . <EOS> for example someone that just goes to the shop that wants a replacement wants it as cheap as possible . <EOS> twenty-five euros is the selling price , <EOS> we really have to innovate here i guess . <EOS>
it was more of a teamwork thing then really leadership based project was <EOS> yep . <EOS> i agree . <EOS> teamwork . <EOS> cohesive yeah . <EOS> yes synergistic yeah . <EOS> synergy . <EOS> there was a lot of synergy . <EOS> teamwork , <EOS> yeah he is uh . <EOS>
yeah it's a bit . <EOS> but i think it should be a bit longer , perhaps . <EOS> so it meets <EOS> i think it meets more the young people than the older people . <EOS> yeah . i think so too . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> but that's what we want , . <EOS>
that's true , mm 'kay . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> there might be something that you can do in the circuit board and the chip to make it make a noise or something , <EOS> but it would take a lot more development than we have this afternoon . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> okay , that's a fair evaluation . <EOS> getting lost . <EOS> um we so we do we've decided not to worry about that for now . <EOS> okay <EOS> 'cause well , the designs are very bright , <EOS> so you're right , they're gonna stick out , <EOS> but um <EOS>
yeah , mm-hmm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> okay , okay . <EOS> and at the end , it this remote has inbuilt voice recogniser which c which will recognise the user's voice and then it'll act accordingly . <EOS> okay . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> okay . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS>
yeah yeah yeah <EOS> like those . <EOS> kinda like those kind of batteries . <EOS> yep . <EOS> but it should be th i think normal batteries , <EOS> not not like two or two uh <EOS> yeah , normal plain <EOS> you <EOS> no <EOS> normal plain batteries you can buy at the supermarket or retail shop . yeah . <EOS>
i'm fine . yeah . <EOS> i uh yeah , yeah . <EOS> d i mean , i i'm finishing off my presentation . <EOS> think she's finishing up her presentation . <EOS> no no . <EOS> uh i'm done . okay . <EOS> okay , jolly good . <EOS> alright , let's have um <EOS> well , we all know that it's it's a remote control that we're gonna be dealing with . <EOS> i think the first thing we should look at is um probably the um what it is that it is actually supposed to be . <EOS> so that's gonna be you catherine , <EOS> if we wanna hear from you first . <EOS>
and your vote ? <EOS> well , <EOS> i was uh doubting about which one to take , <EOS> but uh you've convinced me <EOS> that uh if you di display buttons about the same as they would look on a normal um remote all elderly people will know what to do . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> come under that manufacturer's name <EOS> 'til you find the right one . <EOS> it's that's because televisions , they don't give the remote control any type of feedback when you send it . <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah , that's right . so <EOS> that's that's quite annoying <EOS> and we probably would still have to do that . <EOS> but if we had um some sort of hook-up to your computer as an option , then if you've got a computer you can avoid that rather irritating thing . <EOS>
really ? <EOS> so <EOS> mm . <EOS> so i suppose later it depends if we want to undercut the price , <EOS> we d or <EOS> or is it going to make our product look a cheapie-cheapie option ? <EOS> i think <EOS> yeah , <EOS> um production cost's at twelve fifty , so <EOS>
the the evaluation give satisfying result as well . <EOS> so i think we can move to the last part of the meeting . <EOS> so <EOS> the cost is in the budget , <EOS> the evaluation is okay , <EOS> so i th i think we can now uh open champagne <EOS> and make a huge party . <EOS> i don't know if it's provided by uh by the meeting staff . <EOS> okay so <EOS> congratulation . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> well <EOS> still fifteen minutes . <EOS> um . <EOS> okay , anything else we wanna discuss ? <EOS> well , do we wanna include the numbers like zero through nine ? <EOS> can we conceive of leaving them out ? <EOS> um . <EOS> wait , <EOS> on the remote itself ? <EOS>
mm-hmm , <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> okay <EOS> auxiliary inputs . <EOS> mm-hmm , <EOS> probably colour or sharpness . <EOS> um . <EOS> yep , <EOS> colour , sharpness . <EOS> um a lot of these things will have to be um free and open for users to define them . <EOS>
huh . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> th the internal d engineering design has got to remain the same , yes , absolutely . <EOS> it's gonna be the same , <EOS> so we need to focus on just one thing , <EOS> not get bogged down in lots of different um possibilities , um . <EOS>
so if the left , we have <EOS> the op <EOS> i think you can turn it this way also . <EOS> you can do both with both hands . <EOS> wheel <EOS> wheel buttons . <EOS> yeah , the problem is if you have buttons and wheel then when you turn it around , the buttons are on the other side . <EOS>
it's a cartoon dog i think . <EOS> a s i don't ev <EOS> oh , oh well . <EOS> it's a scary cartoon dog . <EOS> that this , <EOS> that does not look like a dog . <EOS> i'm sorry . <EOS> we can pretend . <EOS> it looks kinda like a person . <EOS>
the next one . <EOS> right here , <EOS> is that little <EOS> that one , <EOS> yes please . <EOS> thank you . <EOS> i'll take the mouse . <EOS> so uh <EOS> we were looking he specifically at the components uh the following components , <EOS> uh the case , the power supply , uh the means of communications with the television set . <EOS> in instance we had talked about using some sort of speech recognition , <EOS> you have to have microphone <EOS> well no you don't actually i haven't have to have microphone in the device , <EOS> but um <EOS> maybe you do have it a a way <EOS> it has to it has to hear the speaker <EOS> and um , <EOS> so it could be in the television set , could be in the device , <EOS> but somewhere you have to put the microphone , <EOS> um <EOS> and a w a way of making beeps or sounds so you can find it when it's gets lost . <EOS> um so the other w thing that we so . <EOS> our method for going about this is we've looked at uh the histo hi historical record , what's worked , what hasn't <EOS> and then we also um we wanted to evaluate some new materials <EOS> and we contacted manufacturing for their input <EOS> because , course , we m might come up and choose the material that then manufacturing didn't have the technologies or capabilities to offer us , <EOS> so uh <EOS> this is the approach that we took during our um our research . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> okay . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> well <EOS> maybe we don't have to defi define the target group by the demographic of age , <EOS> maybe we can define it by like the demographic of <EOS> right . <EOS> like h t how much money they have to spend or something like that , <EOS> like , well <EOS> obviously it has to be someone who owns a television , <EOS> and like how recently have they bought their television like that sort of thing . <EOS>
yes . <EOS> the the second thing is the conceptual design , <EOS> that's what it <EOS> that's uh the spe the specifications of the components and the properties and the specifications of the user interface . <EOS> and we have to look what uh the market is doing for what kind of uh remote controls are in the market . <EOS> and the third thing is uh the detailed design <EOS> um and that's exa <EOS> yeah , <EOS> you know what it is , <EOS> it's exactly how it looks and whatever . <EOS> okay so uh no , <EOS> this is a <EOS> these are two smartboards , with the uh f uh s an introduction of that one . <EOS> and you already saw you know all that that you here can put uh things in the the red project uh map . <EOS> folder , okay . <EOS>
alright . <EOS> eraser . <EOS> and why did you choose this animal ? <EOS> so <EOS> he said it was slow . <EOS> i dunno . <EOS> i it just came into my mind . <EOS> so there's no particular reason <EOS> i pen . <EOS> alright . <EOS> i like it . <EOS>
too small that it goes under the sofa and we can't find it . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> that's . <EOS> just give it a name and we call him . <EOS> yeah , that's right . yeah , that's right . <EOS> and responds to you , and <EOS> okay , so uh next presentation <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> 'cause we di we had a thu think about it . um . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> and it's all recorded , <EOS> woo-hoo . <EOS> yeah <EOS> what i'm gonna i'm gonna put um <EOS> i'm supposed to do this final report thing at the end <EOS> so i'll put all that into the final report as well , or as much as seems like <EOS> maybe not like the articles and stuff , like because and if and so forth , but i'll put most of it in the reports . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> no maybe the shift button's stuck in . <EOS> um okay , so that would take away three , which would give us <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm . <EOS> should <EOS> oh that's fine . <EOS> yeah , so we're <EOS> eleven uh eleven euros sixty . <EOS>
oh <EOS> but we don't have any buttons . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> then defines itself . <EOS> because uh how many percent ? <EOS> eighty percent ? <EOS> they think it's ugly , <EOS> right ? <EOS> would spend more money if it looks fancy . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> so i think i'll have to interact with christine and discuss with her , so that she's not designing something that my studies will show right off the bat that it's not going to work , <EOS> and so it's sort of it's a loop that feeds in , <EOS> but i don't think necessarily that i'm in a coordinating position for it . <EOS>
right . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> i don't know , <EOS> they might put us <EOS> well , let's just . <EOS> two interfaces , <EOS> is that what w should we s say ? <EOS> let's call it th <EOS> two or would it be three ? <EOS>
yes . <EOS> oh <EOS> hang on , <EOS> we haven't heard . <EOS> i can give you a number , <EOS> um it's uh <EOS> the average evaluation score is one point eight eight , <EOS> so it means w <EOS> you know , <EOS> i can i can spell it out . <EOS> there were six true or ones , <EOS> four <EOS> um pardon me , <EOS> two s almost true or close to true , <EOS> so that was four points , <EOS> and then uh one false , seven points , <EOS> so seventeen divided by nine we're between one and two . <EOS>
like large button , <EOS> that's what i was thinking of , <EOS> yeah . <EOS> what about the idea of like a round remote ? instead of like a vertical up and down one . like in terms of holding it . like that's a f shape of a fruit . <EOS> just to tie it in a little . <EOS>
more expensive and yeah . <EOS> course you can do that . <EOS> 'kay . <EOS> sorry to interrupt , <EOS> but we have a warning to finish . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> um <EOS> mm . <EOS> are we out of time ? <EOS> okay , well , <EOS> just to finish up , <EOS> should we s go with this plan , <EOS> start making some <EOS> are good ideas , what are not . <EOS>
no sure . <EOS> so you didn't save it maybe . <EOS> it's mine . <EOS> uh <EOS> it's david jordan . course . <EOS> alright , so <EOS> name's jordan . <EOS> so <EOS> david jordan ? mm-hmm . <EOS> mm yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> so i'll i let david jordan do his presentation . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> is this gonna be enough to to sell ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> well , <EOS> something else that you brought up was uh the ability to lose a remote , <EOS> which as you said you've done , <EOS> in fact we've probably all done . <EOS>
remote settings , et cetera . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> and you could also touch it <EOS> so that it comes out , <EOS> and and use the the the scroll thing as a with your fingers . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> that's c <EOS> yeah . <EOS> indeed . <EOS>
mm ? <EOS> yes . <EOS> i think the marketing manager probably should go first , addressing the needs and desires . <EOS> okay <EOS> you want me to start right now ? <EOS> yeah , mm-hmm . <EOS> okay . <EOS> well , could you um put my slides up <EOS> 'cause i think it might be helpful if uh we looked at the slides at the same time . <EOS>
two , okay . <EOS> uh three , <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> three ? <EOS> okay . <EOS> well , um . <EOS> it looks like we've got got ourselves a pretty good product . <EOS> um the functionality's the only place where maybe we have to think about m m maybe , heaven forbid , having another meeting . <EOS> but um otherwise i think we're we're ready to go to go with this product . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> but <EOS> and stressful . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i think we it should be b it would be better if we worked a little bit together . <EOS> now we worked through each other , <EOS> something he said <EOS> yeah , <EOS> and you had information i also had , <EOS> so some some things i had in my presentation , they already told , <EOS> so <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> well <EOS> i've seen some remote controls that are for more than one device at a time , <EOS> but i also have heard about them not working well or not well co-ordinated <EOS> and you wind up working with this one for thi this three and then this one over here for another . <EOS>
um and i think you are gonna get a chance to play with some clay . <EOS> oh right . <EOS> i think , yeah , it's gonna you know , <EOS> come up ki you know , be ab for the next meeting be able to come in and show us some some i some physical ideas . <EOS> 'cause at the moment , uh you know , it's it's hard . <EOS> we were kinda going , yeah , it's gotta feel nice , it's gotta look cool and that it's <EOS> you know now we can actually start , <EOS>
hmm . <EOS> okay . <EOS> wow . <EOS> yeah , i m i mean the one thing i think about about these ones is um these kl uh secured areas um , i've seen a lot of them with the the cover missing . <EOS> so like have it hinge rather than sort of clip on or whatever . <EOS>
hmm . <EOS> um smart chip that perverts uh that permits , sorry , universal application <EOS> again , something that'll allow us to skip over between devices , <EOS> and that's kinda it . <EOS> uh this is my fifty second design . <EOS> power source over here . <EOS> we're gonna have a switch obviously between the power source and the rest of it , and you're gonna need the switch . <EOS> um extra bulb could just be for flashiness , <EOS> um subcomponent which would be like a way of diverting the power to different parts of the the device . <EOS> um the chip and of course the infra-red bulb , so it can communicate with the various devices that it needs to talk to . <EOS>
yeah it's fashion , <EOS> because it's a fruit , <EOS> and we say that the <EOS> yeah , seven . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> we can we can put a seven here . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , seven . <EOS> yeah . seven , okay . <EOS> yeah . well , <EOS> we hope . <EOS>
. <EOS> see you . <EOS> carry the laptops back again . <EOS> do we need to unplug things ? <EOS> probably . <EOS> hmm . <EOS>
mm . yeah and it mm . <EOS> okay , okay . <EOS> okay , <EOS> but it's quite universal you know . <EOS> mm . <EOS> we can just extend it to any device . <EOS> mm . <EOS> so <EOS> for instance if i want to go to directly to channel twenty five , how would i do can i do that with this ? <EOS>
or a dinosaur . <EOS> no , <EOS> it's a giraffe . <EOS> 'kay . <EOS> i think it's <EOS> easy to r uh to recognise as a giraffe . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> the favourite charis characteristic is that the long neck , <EOS> it can reach everything . <EOS> and i hope i can also reach a lot with this project . <EOS> so <EOS> that's my favourite animal . <EOS>
okay . yeah . <EOS> yeah , that's the right uh option . <EOS> okay . well uh <EOS> the components . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> that's a bit technical , <EOS> and i hadn't i w <EOS> i was a little short on time . <EOS> um but i think i understand it . <EOS> um the energy source is uh the battery , basically . <EOS> um that's connecting to all the components . <EOS>
it's about <EOS> mm , mm yeah . <EOS> seventeen . <EOS> one point four or something like that . <EOS> one point four euro would make a pound or something like that . <EOS> yeah , yeah , something like that , <EOS> so that <EOS> yeah about seventeen , seventeen pounds , something like that . <EOS>
how high is it ? <EOS> no as in the height , but what about the width ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> didn't put five centimetres . <EOS> oh oh <EOS> like depth of the actual thing . <EOS> do we need five ? <EOS> i don't think five is <EOS> be about th three and a half . <EOS>
so basically uh <EOS> what i've just found out from the board <EOS> i dunno if you guys got this email as well <EOS> but it needs to be television only . <EOS> so no <EOS> we're not doing d_v_d_ , <EOS> we're not doing anything else , <EOS> it's just gonna be a television remote . <EOS> um it also needs to have the company colours included in it . <EOS> um so <EOS> that's red and black . <EOS> and it has to have the slogan , case you guys forget the slogan it's , we put fashion in electronics . <EOS>
worse , okay . <EOS> one . <EOS> yes i think uh shape is one . <EOS> yeah , even my yeah , shape is one . <EOS> okay , <EOS> uh-huh one , okay . <EOS> and how about on size ? <EOS> on size <EOS> you you gave it a four . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> most of them , don't they have sort of a combination of the two , <EOS> like <EOS> when there is light , they'll work off the light , <EOS> and if there isn't , they'll kick into this battery , <EOS> so we can maybe do something like that <EOS> whereas there is a battery , <EOS> but if there's enough light , then it's using the light , <EOS> so that it's not actually draining the battery all the time , <EOS> but you will have the battery there for when you need it . <EOS>
and and the next meeting will start in thirty minutes , <EOS> so <EOS> you'll ha all have your spethisfispis specif specific role <EOS> and you know i suppose you know what you have to do . <EOS> and uh <EOS> you will have to work on the design <EOS> and also to work on the design of th technical fun functions of the remote control <EOS> and think of the user requirement specifications . <EOS>
perfect . <EOS> no <EOS> it's important to <EOS> we talked a quite a bit about uh you know the the interchangeable uh faces <EOS> and what we've done here is come up with a bit of a natural look here <EOS> um f we call it fruity <EOS> if you will . <EOS> um . right , um , <EOS> of course that's uh interchangeable <EOS> and uh i think it would be desirable for the uh for the regular product in the in the in the in the first packaging to be something a little bit more subdued <EOS> but this is kind of something that can be done <EOS> um and as you can see on the television there <EOS> uh we have the uh voice detector device um on the top there . <EOS> um . so that that will work quite well with with regard to finding this uh contraption . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . mm . <EOS> could i just ask <EOS> referring back to solar charging , is that compatible with um standard batteries ? <EOS> i mean , could people put standard batteries in but with a s you know they could leave it in the sunlight for solar charging <EOS> or the two things not compatible ? <EOS>
yeah , <EOS> so you can't actually cut <EOS> it's like three times the number of buttons , four , eight , twelve . <EOS> like is is that one big button or is it twelve buttons , <EOS> how can it be something in between ? <EOS> it it needs to be more than one big button because if you open up your phone , underneath there's actually one button underneath , it's just that the panel itself is a single panel . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> well <EOS> we don't have the right colour clay anyway . <EOS> maybe , like i don't know . that could always be . <EOS> well <EOS> we're not , sadly , going to actually be producing this , so . <EOS> oh . <EOS> if they ever come out with potato <EOS>
technologi well <EOS> but in terms of the actual technology , none of it is actually new . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> well mm we have we have the sample speaker as well , which is yeah , it's kind of new . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , but i mean you don't <EOS>
maybe the spongy feel is something we could think about , um . <EOS> maybe still with a rubber design we could <EOS> was that in the sort of fashion sense that this or was the spongy feel was that uh sort of fashion ? <EOS> it was , wasn't it ? <EOS> so the <EOS>
it fell off . <EOS> beep beep beep . <EOS> the characteristics i talk about , <EOS> we have reliability , we have comfort , we have ergonomics , we have environmentally s sensitive . <EOS> uh and the corporation , we're talking about we're we're a new we're a new company . <EOS> we're wanting to make a name for ourself . <EOS> we're wanting you to uh find our product so we're gonna give you a good product at a fair price . <EOS> one thing i would want to to see is uh is can we can we get a lifetime uh guarantee on this product , a normal use guarantee , <EOS> which means that this product , for the for the life of of the life use , if it should have a technical problem , that we could re replace it at no cost ? <EOS> that was something i would be interested in . <EOS> um so yeah <EOS> without uh going into great details , we have a we have a product , <EOS> it has the features and the characteristics , and the background , i believe , to make it marketable i believe at a cost of of of thirty thirty five to to fifty euros . <EOS> we're gonna be competitive , and we're gonna we're gonna have a market niche . <EOS> um w <EOS>
um notes sent out and uh etcetera . <EOS> okay , so <EOS> we'll first of all mm have individual reports from everybody . <EOS> um again i <EOS> there is no order of precedence here <EOS> um so i i i'll leave it up to you to who who who thinks they would like to go go first ? <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm , mm-hmm . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> but i think the pen is v is very intuitive , <EOS> everybody knows how to use it , <EOS> we don't have to worry . <EOS> so i think the pen's good . <EOS> it's about the best thing . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> is it is it actually a book of names to digits , or is it like a few pages ? <EOS> um booklet . some pages . <EOS> i was just thinking , if we were to store this information , some type of mapping . <EOS> this person probably need to use this feature like once , you know , when you first buy the remote control , or whenever they buy a new television , <EOS> so <EOS> once every s <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> oh right , <EOS> that fits , doesn't it ? <EOS> um oh no no no <EOS> sorry <EOS> it's if you use the uh rubber double curved case then you must use rubber buttons . <EOS> that's the way round . <EOS> if you have the rubber case then you have to have the rubber buttons to go with it . <EOS> which makes sense . <EOS>
it's called black . <EOS> kick-off meeting , wow . <EOS> i'm afraid i'm a bit slow for this stuff uh . <EOS> it's uh looks uh nice . <EOS> hmm ? <EOS> okay . <EOS> i'm afraid i'm a bit too slow . <EOS> i don't know how much preparation you guys did , <EOS> but not a lot . <EOS>
uh . <EOS> twenty five . <EOS> uh . <EOS> every fourth , you know . every four some of us knows . <EOS> yeah it's people really <EOS> okay . <EOS> so anyway <EOS> that's for what the biggest frustration uh of the user <EOS> and um <EOS> one of us <EOS>
so um <EOS> the thing we have to know is <EOS> you already know what we're going to do , <EOS> you also read what this the things or , not yet , <EOS> okay . <EOS> so um , yeah , <EOS> it has to be original , trendy , user-friendly <EOS> that's what we're going to design . <EOS> uh first we have uh uh three steps of uh making the the remote control . <EOS> fir the first thing is th the functional design , <EOS> that's very important . <EOS> we have to look what the needs are , the effects of the functional design , and and how the mm the the remote control works , so that's where we're going to look in the functional design , <EOS> it's for the f next meeting . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> what kind of fr fruit would you like to to control your t_v_ with ? <EOS> mm . <EOS> odi <EOS> banana i think , <EOS> it's a nice idea . <EOS> banana is also yellow so you you can't lost your remote control then . <EOS> because <EOS> but <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> so you used uh this uh the different powerpoint presentations <EOS> uh in which you put your uh material in the <EOS> oh . <EOS> that wasn't me . <EOS> uh so um <EOS> the means , we discussed the smart board , <EOS> and what about uh this digital pen ? <EOS>
you know like like just a printed yeah or coloured yeah . <EOS> so it's just colour , and not necessarily the shape of a strawberry . <EOS> yeah . that could work . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> or i mean we could even have fruit like around <EOS> i mean <EOS>
no <EOS> the <EOS> yeah . <EOS> industrial designer , okay , <EOS> sorry . <EOS> let's just use the acronyms . <EOS> um and of course specific instructions uh will be sent to you uh through your personal coach . <EOS> so <EOS> so <EOS> i should look at uh what you should be able to do with the remote , <EOS> or uh , or how i don't really <EOS>
it works . <EOS> yeah just explain the button uh norman . <EOS> mm . <EOS> you can move up , down , left , right , <EOS> or you can do a swing . <EOS> so a swing to the left , a swing to the right defines other functions . <EOS> so even though it's a single button , but it is pretty s flexible because of the three hundred and sixty degree movement . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> this is the version y that comes with l_c_d_ . <EOS> here i present another version without the l_c_d_ . <EOS>
mm . sure . sure . <EOS> yeah , i'm sure they'll be able to <EOS> uh-huh . <EOS> i mean it's only pressing buttons , <EOS> you don't have to do anything , you know , extraordinary . <EOS> i think everybody can press a button with their left and right hand so <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> i mean , if you look like at the coffee maker at the at the corporate web page , it's not obvious . <EOS> mm . <EOS> r_r_ . <EOS> well it is to us , because we we worked worked here for years and we use that coffee machine , <EOS> but it's doesn't have the colour scheme of of the of the company anywhere on it obviously it's just sil silver and black . <EOS>
i don't think so . <EOS> yes . <EOS> yes . <EOS> don't looks nice uh . <EOS> yeah , so uh <EOS> what we'll do is , uh , we will stick with the the simple design for time being <EOS> until uh th ed find outs about the how much it's cost to the extra , in case we go for the display . <EOS> okay . so <EOS> maybe what you can do is uh , both of you , you can come up with the the prototype , okay , the model . <EOS> okay ? <EOS>
okay . <EOS> no , <EOS> we're gonna put it like we've got <EOS> th there's the locator dot . <EOS> no , <EOS> we have a locator . <EOS> mm that you stick on t_v_ . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah well w <EOS> but l but the speak sample speaker is included , <EOS> so it it has some capacity to mm to do some to make some sounds , so yeah . <EOS>
it does sampling out of the . <EOS> well i guess that depends on how you market it . <EOS> if you <EOS> if you have the right advertisement showing how how how easy it is and how you can , you know , navigate to a program without the numbers , then people might say that looks pretty easy . <EOS>
'kay <EOS> yep that's you . <EOS> does that mean i'm up ? <EOS> i think so . <EOS> okay . <EOS> oh that would be perfect . thank you . <EOS> i can plug you in . <EOS> slide show up and running . <EOS> or not . uh . <EOS>
um we could use solar cells . <EOS> or a device that was not n not further specified that provides kinetic energy . <EOS> such as like watches you know . where you just move them <EOS> m move the the actual device and this pr uh provides it with with uh some energy . <EOS> so um obviously i personally have to say that dynamo is out of the question really . <EOS> you don't wanna wind up your remote control before you can use it <EOS> right ? <EOS> um solar cell is interesting . <EOS> may fail though , every here and there . <EOS>
mm-hmm . mm-hmm . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> well right away i'm wondering if there's um th th uh , like with d_v_d_ players , if there are zones . <EOS> um f frequencies or something <EOS> um as well as uh characters , <EOS> um different uh keypad styles and s symbols . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> wow . <EOS> you are a child of technology , aren't you ? <EOS> um so yeah um <EOS> i was thinking something easy to use , especially for older people . <EOS> um has to look really cool , flashy groovy for people to buy it . <EOS> and it's easy to find , <EOS> so i don't know whether maybe <EOS> and also we asked them whether they wanted whether they'd be interested in um voice activating . <EOS>
hmm . <EOS> so <EOS> i had a look on the on the web uh to see if i could find a few examples of existing television remote controls . <EOS> in analysing these we can consider what what things what's good about them , <EOS> uh what things do they get right , <EOS> what's bad about them , <EOS> what's wrong with 'em , <EOS> um how we can improve on the designs that that that i found <EOS> and what can we do to make our product stand out from from the large majority of remote controls . <EOS> here's two examples uh probably at the extreme ends of the spectrum . <EOS> um on the left here we've got uh an engineering-based design for a remote control , <EOS> so it's one that's got lots of buttons , <EOS> it's it's fully featured , <EOS> everything you might possibly want to do is there , <EOS> you know , it's got forward , backwards , up , down , channel numbers , volume , uh freeze frame . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> it's it's fully featured <EOS> and it might take a while to get to learn to use it , <EOS> but once you've learned it you can you can do whatever you want with your t_v_ . <EOS>
yeah it's the right shape isn't it ? <EOS> but maybe if you had a trigger plus the scroll then that would get past the the problem of it landing and scrolling , <EOS> 'cause then it would need to be hit on both sides . <EOS> mm . <EOS> right . <EOS> so maybe in a final design phase we might tweak that a little bit , <EOS> but <EOS>
okay . <EOS> that explains a lot . <EOS> i have no idea why we don't have it , <EOS> but <EOS> that's good . <EOS> interesting . <EOS> okay , we need to talk about our functions and our target group . <EOS> we need to decide who our target group is . <EOS> you um in your analysis of different market um of the marketing , you identified that different groups wanted different things <EOS> or had certain preferences , <EOS> for example that um that older people didn't really care for um voice recognition , <EOS> but younger people did . <EOS> um and so <EOS> who are we aiming this at ? <EOS>
hmm . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> from our f fashion people in paris and milan , um we've discovered that this year um fruit the fruit and vegetable motif will be the most important thing in in clothes , shoes and furniture . <EOS> so , i'm pretty confident that our remote control fits into the furniture category . <EOS> and also um the feel of material this year um is expected to be spongy . <EOS>
uh that mm that could be feasible i guess , <EOS> like <EOS> to l to l lock it . okay . <EOS> so <EOS> since we have we want to do some speaker dependent speech recognition uh so we can use <EOS> yeah . so it could be smart in that way . <EOS>
good question . <EOS> no , <EOS> this is like i said that we have to be discussed between all of us and we'll go from there . <EOS> we'll have to simply we'll have to work on it together . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> okay , <EOS> so uh by when you think you can uh give me some kind of uh project plan , okay , <EOS> a discussion with uh <EOS>
yeah , thi this might be . <EOS> and push button . <EOS> so if we have all integrated i in the scroll wheel and push button , it's uh <EOS> close to . <EOS> one . <EOS> i can remove <EOS> maybe f you have five with push buttons , so we can just , i dunno , try to modify some of them to have yeah . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> first um , they say that's uh about something about t teletext . <EOS> uh apparently it becomes from according to them it becomes out of date . out-dated . <EOS> and uh <EOS> because of the internet popularity and everybody has internet at home , and actually it's not useful to have teletext . <EOS> um . <EOS> so i think we can avoid the teletext . <EOS> um the second thing is uh they suggest that that we should uh use the remote control only for t_v_ , not for d_v_d_ and other devices , <EOS> because it make it it makes it's too complex <EOS> and uh because we have not much time for this project we should stay on t_v_ on the only specific t_v_ remote control . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> and uh the most important aspect is the l the look <EOS> it has to look fancy , look and feel <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> uh instead of the current functional look and feel . <EOS> this is a st <EOS> well <EOS> i was gonna say yeah twice as important as the second aspect , <EOS> which is the technologically innov innovative um side of it . <EOS> so uh <EOS> and the third being easy to use is probably a given , <EOS> we have to try and incorporate , <EOS> so uh <EOS>
yeah , <EOS> i uh <EOS> yeah , that's a good idea , okay . <EOS> yeah . we'll have enough power <EOS> to <EOS> everything agre <EOS> everyone agrees with that , <EOS> or <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yep . <EOS> maybe what paul said , uh under the on the on the home station , uh a button to uh to call your uh remote control , that it beeps . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> 'cause we weren't like voting on anything <EOS> and i think usually , like whiteboards are good , you know like crossing out ideas , or like if we had had like a brainstorming period . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> we could've put our brainstorming stuff up there rather than just talking about it , <EOS> but with only four people it doesn't really make sense . <EOS> i think if you had a larger group <EOS>
what about the electronics ? that's not really gonna change much , is it ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> cost effective . <EOS> no , it it doesn't cost , yeah . <EOS> that that w that won't change much , will it uh ? <EOS> no <EOS> yeah . doesn't doesn't doesn't matter . <EOS>
to <EOS> look it even has settings . <EOS> okay . <EOS> hmm ? <EOS> yeah , well we don't want the screen i guess , <EOS> but um <EOS> 'cause that just <EOS> it does seem like , it that would be , like , incredibly expensive , <EOS> but i dunno , <EOS> and then so , <EOS> it just im really all you need is , like , this little wheel then , and you can control everything . <EOS>
cheers . <EOS> mm . more loud clicks in the microphone . <EOS> there we go , oh . <EOS> method of evaluation testing the product was to just if it met all the criteria all the conditions that we set out to set out to solve , from the point of view of the the consumer and the management . <EOS> so <EOS> what i've been asked to do is , on the whiteboard <EOS>
kinda christmas , you know . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> yeah , yeah . <EOS> apple green , brown , more kinda trendy , you know , khaki <EOS> yeah . <EOS> the pomegranate's kinda girly and funky kind of , <EOS> and then the vanilla's more for the more sophisticated customer who just wants something that fits in with all decor . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> so d all the random decisions at the end could have been prevented . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm . <EOS> but in terms of the process of um going and working individually and then coming back to a meeting , that that worked in terms of . <EOS>
you guys <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> um easy to use . i vote six . <EOS> oh wait , that's false . <EOS> oh , <EOS> two . <EOS> okay . <EOS> i'd say two as well . <EOS> yeah , two . <EOS> two . that's what i say . <EOS>
exactly . <EOS> i mean <EOS> i i i uh did not receive any information on that , <EOS> but i think the competition , sussing out what other people are doing and what's in the pipeline is very very important , <EOS> because um there is a question about do you want an l_c_d_ screen <EOS> and and that wasn't responded to , <EOS> but uh some of the larger remotes do have screens where you can navigate , <EOS> you know , <EOS> so it turns into something <EOS> uh perhaps you all have seen uh the osbournes <EOS> where ozzy osbourne is is attempting to manage his super entertainment system with something that looks like a uh a small tray . <EOS> you know , <EOS> it's i a and i think , <EOS> you know <EOS>
where are they ? <EOS> um they're in the l_c_d_ panel and the jog-dial ? <EOS> okay 'cause <EOS> ah , right . <EOS> great . <EOS> so w what kind of thing uh is gonna be <EOS> the l_c_d_ panel just displays um functionally what you're doing . <EOS> if you're using an advanced function right , like um c brightness , contrast , whatever , it will just say <EOS> you know it's like <EOS> it only has four columns , it's a very simple l_c_d_ like , <EOS> whereas many the minimum amount we need that the user will automatically know like this is brightness or this is contrast . <EOS>
i dunno . <EOS> i guess <EOS> i mean is there some way we could make it this kind of shape ? <EOS> 'cause like kind of <EOS> we could make it that shape but just have different colours , and call 'em the different fruits . <EOS> we went with shape because we were having fun with the play-dough . <EOS>
yes well <EOS> m maybe <EOS> uh , i don't know whether that's possible , <EOS> maybe you can start evaluating uh their work somehow . <EOS> mm . <EOS> okay <EOS> well <EOS> is this me designing a way to evaluate it <EOS> so <EOS> thinking about how to set up test groups and things ? <EOS>
very good . <EOS> great . <EOS> i'll rub that out . <EOS> there you go . <EOS> okay . <EOS> i think my favourite animal would be a dog , <EOS> but i'm not really sure how to draw one . <EOS> i , i've never drawn a dog , i don't think . <EOS> i'm tempted to draw a snail 'cause i draw them sometimes and they're really easy to draw . <EOS> um , <EOS>
mm-hmm . yeah . <EOS> uh because of costs . <EOS> and it's plastic as well , <EOS> so it won't be as comfortable on the hand . <EOS> yeah , i mean <EOS> the <EOS> uh yeah . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i mean with the with the rubber design it could i you know it could pretty much mould very much to the to the user's hand . <EOS> one nice wee feature <EOS> if we could if we could still do the rubber , i though of was to have the uh rubber extend beyond the end of the uh of the rigid substructure . <EOS> so it has a wee sort of tail <EOS> that you just drape over your wrist <EOS> so it stays in position nicely . <EOS>
so <EOS> i will invite uh <EOS> agnes , can you go to the third slide ? <EOS> no , <EOS> this is the third slide . <EOS> okay , . <EOS> so , <EOS> i'll invite uh christine to discuss about uh the functional design . <EOS> 'kay , <EOS> do you wanna open the <EOS>
mm . <EOS> excellent . <EOS> shall we just go around the table ? <EOS> uh okay . <EOS> well , <EOS> my name is iain uh <EOS> mm . <EOS> and i'm the user interface designer for the project . um . <EOS> and i'll try and draw my favourite animal . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> so <EOS> this is from the experiments we've done , <EOS> so if we could solve this problem this would be interesting for the user , i think . <EOS> um it takes too much time to learn how to use the remote control for thirty five percent of the people . <EOS> and uh remote control are really bad for r_s_i_ problems for twenty six percent of the users . <EOS>
and a marketing strategy . <EOS> and marketing strategy , thank you . <EOS> fired . <EOS> yes . <EOS> how much you can <EOS> how mu how much how much you can sell extra . <EOS> of course you'll make money too , <EOS> so it it's not only pay-out , you make money too , your commission . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> i'll i'll say two as well . <EOS> because older people that aren't used to like texting with the thumb might find it a bit at first , <EOS> but <EOS> mm . <EOS> 'kay . <EOS> yeah <EOS> i'll i'll say two . <EOS> alright , <EOS> awesome . <EOS> and the ease of learning it . <EOS> i know you were saying that you're a little bit nervous about that , <EOS> i dunno . <EOS> it sort of reminds me of the ipod . <EOS> i just got mine , <EOS> i still haven't read the instruction book <EOS> and i'm doing okay , so <EOS> and i'm not good at learning technology . <EOS> so i'll give it a two . <EOS>
well it says that <EOS> when you say d when you say double-curved , what what exactly does that mean ? <EOS> i'm not exactly sure . <EOS> um i'll show you the remotes that i've got . <EOS> okay . <EOS> see how uh <EOS> let's just get that bigger . <EOS> see how uh the one <EOS> oh i'm not plugged in , am i ? <EOS> that doesn't help . <EOS> shall i just turn it round for time ? <EOS>
okay . <EOS> you're participant four . <EOS> i'm participant four i believe . yes uh-huh . <EOS> 'kay . <EOS> okay , and now i can uh full screen . <EOS> open . <EOS> uh , okay , okay . <EOS> there we go . <EOS> okay well i think we have introduced ourselves , <EOS> so the functional requirements are is is part of my goal <EOS> but why don't we pass right to the second slide . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> i i'd like to see what what it looks like on the <EOS> they're nicer than the pen that i'm using , <EOS> because like your stuff actually shows up here , rather than having to look at the screen and write . <EOS> mm . <EOS> but even so , i dunno . <EOS>
'kay . <EOS> before we move on . um <EOS> if i get any more information of fruits and vegetables , i'll let you know . could could we uh could we have changeable covers like for your mobile ? in different fruit and vegetable colours , yeah . <EOS> like , to make it different fruits . <EOS>
for now . <EOS> i dunno , <EOS> what do you guys think ? <EOS> think we just need to come up with a nice black and red interface on the touch screen . <EOS> that'd be okay . <EOS> yeah . nice . <EOS> yeah . uh i i'm i'm in agreement with that , <EOS> i'm wondering how we're gonna get uh we put fashion into electronics onto this device . <EOS>
i think if we both step up <EOS> and uh outline our ideas . <EOS> okay . now <EOS> do uh doing the prototype gave us a bit more insight into the ergonomics of the design . <EOS> um for one thing , it turned out that the only point at which it needs to be articulated for handedness is um is h i is down here for the uh l_e_d_ . <EOS> as it turned out , the whole thing transfers from the right to left hand fairly well from the point of view of operating the uh function buttons and joystick , <EOS> though it might be an idea to be able to a adjust the positions for the base of the joystick just a little bit <EOS> for uh <EOS>
yes . <EOS> we have to <EOS> i have to catch you , <EOS> sorry . <EOS> we have to to go through the meeting . <EOS> thank you . <EOS> wind up <EOS> ? okay , some other time . <EOS> thank you . <EOS> okay . <EOS> we can discuss that off-line . <EOS>
that's christine's . <EOS> this is christine . <EOS> and that's mine , i think . <EOS> that's yours , okay . <EOS> saving . <EOS> in modified . <EOS> i don't know , <EOS> i think verbally we can we can pretty much sell . <EOS> okay , uh <EOS> i will i will send you a mail , <EOS> okay ? <EOS> the project may be the the project aim , <EOS> okay . <EOS> at the end of the day , the company uh wants to make at least uh the fifty million euro . <EOS> okay , <EOS> and uh of course the price will be very reasonable on the the sales side . <EOS> okay , <EOS> that maybe eddie will talk to you about uh how much uh the price <EOS> and uh what's uh <EOS> how much its cost for the manufacturing <EOS> and how much it's going to be we sell in the market . <EOS> okay . <EOS> then uh you can come back with your feedback . <EOS> and i i have one maybe the suggestion or opinion . <EOS> this remote control , okay , it can be for like universal , to use for any t_v_ . <EOS> okay , <EOS> and it will be slim , <EOS> okay , <EOS> and uh <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> for example the battery energy source or um what if the chip , for whatever reason , breaks down after a certain amount of time , do you just replace it ? <EOS> um is there any um <EOS> because it may be in the same area with several other user interfaces , like for d_v_d_s , movies , whatever . <EOS> um does it have to have a a way of being segregated from the others , in a different frequency or something ? <EOS>
. <EOS> i like <EOS> i'll help talk . <EOS> um yeah so what we ended up with . <EOS> production costs estimated by our manufacturing department and um the research department , which is us , is uh fifteen point eight euros , <EOS> someone forgot the units there <EOS> yeah , uh unit price <EOS> unit production price cost thing . um <EOS>
may not be beep . <EOS> beep or uh it's a light , maybe it's a light . <EOS> and do you think a good c c um clue for that is that it would respond to a clap or it would respond to your voice or it would respond what what should you have to do to make it beep or blink ? <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> that's <EOS> but then if you're buying the remote separately , <EOS> but y you could have something , but i if it was something that you could like stick onto the t_v_ or something , <EOS> some like a two p if you bought it in a two part pack , so one part attaches to the t_v_ . <EOS>
okay <EOS> the um th the the next uh thing we we we'll have a look at the uh th have a look at the prototypes <EOS> and uh look at the uh evaluation criteria and finance <EOS> and then uh uh just tidy up with production <EOS> and um and then we can close . um <EOS> so f if if you'd like to uh present your your proposals . <EOS>
eight . <EOS> eight . <EOS> well <EOS> actually we have yeah to check again yeah . <EOS> yeah , eight euros yeah . <EOS> and this one was sixteen euros . <EOS> yes . <EOS> sixteen . <EOS> sixteen euros . <EOS> okay . so . <EOS> innovation for this one is two ? one ? <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> so this is one one of the interface which can be created . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> a very simple interface which has all the t uh uh important features . <EOS> then , please , next slide . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah and more play doh , <EOS> 'cause that was all the red we had . <EOS> so even if we wanted to make a bigger prototype , we wouldn't have been able to . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , it c it might've been bigger . <EOS>
so . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yep . so <EOS> w we can go back and l talk to the suppliers maybe <EOS> and see if we can drive the prices down to add a few more things in <EOS> but that's all we can do with the restrictions we have at the moment . <EOS>
i don't know . <EOS> yeah is it is user interface . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> concepts . <EOS> component . <EOS> this concept is in the actual design , <EOS> but you should know where you would place a <EOS> okay , well <EOS> le <EOS> yeah . interface , yeah . <EOS>
well , w we want to have a new re remote control for for t_v_ distribution i guess . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> so we have to plan how how it would be developed and uh <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm . <EOS> how we can make it work . <EOS>
you have one in mind ? <EOS> i'm gonna about the uh spider <EOS> because you can actually draw it pretty well in the corner of a white board . <EOS> the spider has a <EOS> spider lives in a web <EOS> and uh it has eight legs , <EOS> and uh it can move all about the web in two dimensions . <EOS> unless it's a three dimensional web which y they have sometimes . <EOS> there are some spiders that live in like that have like uh kind of a a big ball of a of a web . <EOS> and uh the other thing is some spiders can actually uh fly <EOS> like uh they have uh they let out like uh a stream of like the web building material <EOS> but it's it acts like a parachute so they can actually kind of go and find new uh build a new web somewhere else . <EOS> so i think they did this in uh in charlotte's web that movie <EOS> that little uh <EOS> well it's actually a book first <EOS> but uh um at the end all the the spiders kinda flew away . <EOS> so , that's my animal . <EOS>
and uh manufacturing has told us that they've um uh recently developed a uh a sensor and a speaker that would uh be integrated into this advanced chip on print , <EOS> so uh we we uh <EOS> now jumping right to our personal preferences <EOS> um i i'd really think we should , you know , use some of uh some really exotic woods , like um , <EOS> you know uh , well you guys come from tropical countries so you can kinda think of some trees and some nice woods . <EOS> i think that people will might really want to design their own cases , <EOS> you see , they could do sort of a this um three-dimensional design on the internet , <EOS> and then they could submit their orders , kinda like you submit a custom car order , you know , <EOS> and you can choose the colour and the size of the wheels and the colours of the leather and things like that , <EOS> and then i uh think we should go with the solar cells as well as the um microphone and speaker on the advanced chip . <EOS> so this is the findings of our research <EOS> and my recommendations um for the new remote control w um would be to have um have it be made out of wood . <EOS> do you have any problems with that ? <EOS>
so you you have to buy two things , the banana and the basis station . <EOS> bu it's it's . <EOS> you s you you thing . <EOS> basis station is with the thing . <EOS> it's like a telephone handset is there and the basis station for the telephone hand set is there . <EOS> so now what user gets additionally he doesn't have to buy batteries , they're rechargeable batteries , so over the period of cor time he'll recover the cost . <EOS> so you're having the basis station and there is a button , <EOS> if you press that button wherever the remote it'll start beeping so you know where the remote is . uh <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> just a just a phone , wireless . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> so having this at twenty five euros is uh quite attractive , i think . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i think the <EOS> but almo also the complexity between a phone and a remote control is not cannot compare . <EOS>
like if this is gonna get lost underneath the coach , how are we going to accommodate the quick ability to find it ? <EOS> oh right <EOS> yeah okay . <EOS> mm 'kay . <EOS> tracking . <EOS> because people really are looking for a remote that's more high-tech . <EOS>
that's quite good . <EOS> right . there's my dog . <EOS> um i like dogs because they're very loyal . <EOS> and they're always happy , <EOS> so whenever whenever you're feeling sort of a bit a bit down or tired , they're always coming up and they're always um quite excited . <EOS> so um you can always have a lot of fun with a dog . <EOS> and they're also good for exercise as well . <EOS> you can sorta get out and they they sorta never get tired . <EOS> and and when they're tired they're quite cute as well , so . <EOS>
alright , yeah . <EOS> crack on . <EOS> okay so <EOS> we'll start off with a quick overview of the minutes . <EOS> i think to sum up the last meeting , would be to say um the requirements that we've um set out . <EOS> those are we were going to go for what seemed to be a fairly minimal design based on uh a small joystick , l_c_d_ and a couple of other buttons for navigation um with power being i suppose one of the main single purpose buttons . <EOS> um we were also going to use novelty of being able to locate the remote control again via a small transmitter with any luck , <EOS> the idea to try and separate us <EOS> and also because of the minimal design um looks like we'll be able to be fairly adventurous in the actual physical shape of our remote control with any luck . <EOS> um that pretty much sums up the last one . <EOS> so <EOS> we'll just crack on , <EOS> um like to maybe start with the industrial designer if it's possible . <EOS> um uh the con today is the concep today . <EOS> this uh meeting is the conceptual design phase <EOS> and is um <EOS>
no l_c_d_ . <EOS> okay great . um . <EOS> very good . <EOS> okay . <EOS> oh we need a we need a power um on off switch as well . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> uh for the remote ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> oh , just the switch , <EOS> no f not for the t_v_ for the t_v_ . <EOS> uh so you <EOS>
mm . <EOS> everyone has a t_v_ remote , <EOS> but then we add in the fact that they could each have their own individual fruit . <EOS> that's what's hot on the catwalks . <EOS> so , <EOS> this is my <EOS> this is what i'm thinking . <EOS> hmm . <EOS>
i know . <EOS> what is it ? <EOS> yeah , <EOS> it's like black , black and white kind of <EOS> like running along the bottom ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> you can also get the kind of the t_v_ guide so <EOS> it'll give you the sports . <EOS>
or or that we have to have some sort of special colour . <EOS> yeah , but <EOS> so that's alright . <EOS> we we'll leave it at that <EOS> and then i'll take i can send it back to management <EOS> and say we weren't quite sure about the colour , <EOS> if that costs extra then we've still got some space for it , <EOS> yeah . <EOS> excellent . <EOS> alright . <EOS> so did we lose um on our evaluation criteria , as a result of doing that ? <EOS>
yeah , n n no , we just want it to be a finder . <EOS> but then it <EOS> no . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> okay . <EOS> but do can your <EOS> can the department make <EOS> that would be like a mid-class um yeah . <EOS> so we don't actually have to go for <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> menu , alright . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> uh uh <EOS> right , <EOS> i was thinking on the same lines you , <EOS> instead of having too many b buttons and make it complicated for the user , may h maybe have an l_c_d_ di display or something like that , <EOS> like a mobile , yeah and with menus . <EOS> and if it's s somewhat similar to what you have on mobile phone , people might find it easier to browse and navigate also maybe . <EOS>
okay then . <EOS> um i think we're still well within our time . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> we've got like five minutes left . <EOS> we've got about five minutes left , <EOS> but if we've finished , then we've finished . <EOS> we're just too too efficient <EOS> and you should never drag a meeting on just because you have extra time . <EOS>
okay , <EOS> we'll find that out . <EOS> yep . <EOS> from from your side uh , you're gonna have to go back the management <EOS> and s be more s precise . <EOS> what do they want ? <EOS> uh , a risk , take a risk on the market ? <EOS> something that's gonna cost more , but could very easily s make a boom in the market ? <EOS>
uh <EOS> uh . <EOS> uh i thought for the side view , that the w the basic section would be rather uh a bit thicker than the middle , where you're holding it with your <EOS> 'cause your fingers have to fit underneath and <EOS> jesus . <EOS> what do i write down ? <EOS>
mm . <EOS> mm that's a good idea actually i like the programmable options . <EOS> yeah , me too . <EOS> oh okay . <EOS> and the uh , the bells and whistles that we mentioned you know , they take more budgeting , um more technical uh expenditure of effort <EOS> and it's also much more likely to not work if if we add these bells and whistles . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> room . <EOS> oh yeah . <EOS> well i dunno <EOS> do you th <EOS> i think it means um i think it means did you feel you were able to give creative input so <EOS> sorry . <EOS> huh . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah <EOS> i th okay on th um yeah dif <EOS> answering the question uh in those terms i'd say that actually there's sort of a tease of creativity <EOS> because we're asked to work through this , but actually the guidelines are fairly contrived in terms of um okay fashion trends , say fruit and vegetable colour scheme , <EOS> but then i then we're told okay use the co company company colours . <EOS>
right , <EOS> do you wanna start ? <EOS> right , well <EOS> we made three different prototypes <EOS> and i guess we'll start with with this one . <EOS> um we have <EOS> our colours not are not fixed , <EOS> but this is the general shape . <EOS> um it's <EOS> you hold it sort of either like like this in your left hand <EOS> or you switch it over <EOS> and uh it's easily adaptable to either hand . <EOS> you can push the buttons with your thumb like a mobile phone , <EOS> or you can push them with your index finger of your other hand , <EOS> or even <EOS> i mean there's a whole variety , <EOS> you can hold it like this <EOS> and press it with your same index finger . <EOS> uh we have the on off button at the tip , very visible , very big . <EOS> we have our up and down buttons , <EOS> which are also gonna be our channel selectors , <EOS> and we have our little menu button here . <EOS> if you push if you're just pushing these normally , they're the menu buttons , if uh the volume buttons rather . <EOS> if you press select once , they become channel changing buttons . <EOS> if we press select three times , the menu with the other features and pro possibly also with your t_v_ channel choices shows up , <EOS> and you have your five presets down here . <EOS> um if people wanna grab hold of that , <EOS> see how it feels in your hand . <EOS> that's our number one prototype . <EOS> um do you wanna present the potato , <EOS> or shall i present the martian ? <EOS>
mm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> on maybe a a rect on a rectangle <EOS> but maybe not necessarily as boring , as plain as a rectangle . <EOS> mm . <EOS> um shall we maybe shoot for a a specific uh target group ? <EOS> that way we could l i mean if it were , <EOS> if we were shooting for young guys then it's um a certain look to the remote . or girls or older people ? <EOS> um <EOS> would that <EOS> you think that would help us find um a specific form ? that we would would wanna pick out ? <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> like the volume buttons should be the all the same colour and the d and the the channel buttons should be one colour and stuff like that , do you mean ? <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> and on the back of it have the logo . <EOS>
although , what it was it uh <EOS> it was uh nokia that came out with this changeable colours . <EOS> right , you take it apart , and put on another face , take it off and put on another face <EOS> and then they sold millions , millions . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> because one of th one of the things we're marketing about this product is that this is the last one you will ever need to buy for your television . <EOS> it's one of the marketing features in this . <EOS> right . <EOS> mm . <EOS> that's why the scroll needs to be really robust . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> but but we are sort of being dictated that this should only be for the television . <EOS> so we're quite fixed . <EOS> so we're really probably , in terms of marketing , are looking for that's uh that's a cost winner rather than a fantastic new feature product . <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
but a not as normal button , in the l_c_d_ , <EOS> yeah . <EOS> well <EOS> maybe there should be a separate button apart from the l_c_d_ , <EOS> because you can't turn it on when the l_c_d_ is off . <EOS> so how do you turn the thing on ? <EOS> there has to be a on button on the remote , <EOS> huh ? <EOS>
yeah mm-hmm . <EOS> that's uh <EOS> bear bear in mind it has to be the colours and styles of the company , <EOS> so what i had been thinking was something chunky and yellow and plastic with black buttons with a logo on it . <EOS> banana ? <EOS> alright , <EOS> well <EOS> let's see then . <EOS>
mm the shared folder . <EOS> sh share folder for th your presentation ? <EOS> yes . <EOS> we have a presentation . <EOS> because i have here <EOS> uh <EOS> so i got the participant uh three . <EOS> w uh . <EOS> three . <EOS> it's the final design , <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
i know . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> something that doesn't <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> um . okay , <EOS> it seems we have a little bit of a conflict over um to uh combining all the remotes cont together versus having f five different remotes . <EOS> so um <EOS> like you said you don't like having all the buttons on one on one remote , <EOS> and yet you don't wanna have five remotes . <EOS> so how do we work with that ? <EOS>
yep . <EOS> oh sh god <EOS> we've got five minutes <EOS> um okay uh <EOS> back we go . <EOS> um energy what do you think that's suggesting we're how we're powering the thing ? <EOS> i really like the idea of this kinetic thing where you'd have the back-up of the battery , but have have kinetic power , <EOS> i mean what does anybody think about that ? <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> and they don't really want to zap between functions of their remote control , <EOS> they want to zap between channels on t_v_ . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> so <EOS> i think you have quite lot of points to to think about <EOS> and to discuss it with uh the other members . <EOS>
mm-hmm , yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> i it looks quite conventional . mm . <EOS> don't you agree ? mm yeah . <EOS> on the scale u it's between functional and fancy basically we're looking at , <EOS> so <EOS> so maybe two . <EOS> hmm . hmm . <EOS> ma ma ma ma maybe say say five <EOS> i <EOS> it's my opinion , <EOS> but i don't know what what <EOS>
okay , right right . <EOS> so it's one for from your point of view . <EOS> and what do you say our industrial expert ? <EOS> okay , so one . <EOS> yep . <EOS> uh . <EOS> it's hard to know . <EOS> i i give it a two . <EOS>
most of them will intuitively pick it up though . <EOS> okay , <EOS> so we're going to go anywhere from kids to adult in the age range <EOS> um what about <EOS> yeah , i think we need it all . <EOS> technic technical um specifications , <EOS> like how how technically literate are these people who are going to be using our remote ? <EOS>
yep . <EOS> so <EOS> i will start by the the basic one <EOS> that uh fits into uh eight euros actually , right , seven eight euros , <EOS> and uh well <EOS> first for both they have um a special shape , <EOS> maybe the designer can uh explain better than me , <EOS> but uh it's like a surf board . <EOS> and you you are supposed to surf to browse to surf t_v_ , maybe the web , <EOS> and uh it's kind of interesting shape <EOS> because um unconsciously people want to s to surf when they see this stuff . <EOS> and also it's not too far from um a mobile . <EOS>
maybe . <EOS> well yeah <EOS> i think , mean we obviously need a good way to position all the buttons <EOS> and <EOS> but i don't think we should spend very much time in that . <EOS> mm . no . <EOS> do you think the docking station will uh is allowed in the budget we have ? <EOS>
yeah i mean , that that seems to work well with for products like ipod , <EOS> where , you know , you have a variety of colours , that people feel like they're customising it when they buy it , even , you know , just just by the fact of choosing . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm . <EOS> no . <EOS> yeah . okay . <EOS> and how exactly does the kinetic energy work ? <EOS> you just <EOS> well <EOS> y you basically shake your remote , and then it powers up . <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> i think it does very well . <EOS> oh yeah . <EOS> because <EOS> yeah , <EOS> because the most accessible buttons are the volume and the and the channel-changing . <EOS> and it's just you won't have to think about it . <EOS> you don't have to look down to find them . <EOS> they're clearly there , <EOS> easy to use . <EOS> simple . <EOS>
it does seem like the paper's still a heavy consideration for taking notes . <EOS> so maybe this is literally just a way around it . <EOS> um i dunno . <EOS> how are people satisfied with the teamwork we've managed to display today ? <EOS> good . <EOS> . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> 'kay . <EOS> with our microphones still attached to our bodies . <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> gosh . <EOS> 'kay , what's my favourite animal ? <EOS> do come up . <EOS> oh , <EOS> to go first . <EOS> oh , <EOS> are we all doing it individually ? <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> gonna be visible down the line . <EOS> so our target group , we're saying , fifteen to thirty five ? <EOS> well , <EOS> i dunno how useful that number is if we're not doing <EOS> s voice recognition , <EOS> which i kind of i kind of feel like voice recognition is not necessary in a remote control , <EOS> like it might be necessary for a t_v_ but not for the remote c , you know . <EOS> seems a little bit <EOS>
well , it can be whatever you want . <EOS> but if it's square then we get four screens out of one by cutting just . <EOS> but if you want some shape then we can only get like two screens out of seven to seven inches , so . <EOS>
yeah , <EOS> and it's ergonomic as well . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> a pear . <EOS> the banana is also ergonomic . <EOS> yeah . maybe pear yeah or something like that . <EOS> or a fruit like that . <EOS> i dunno . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> we can discuss that uh . <EOS> d d is is there anything you want to add ? <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> very visual intended . <EOS> what was i to say more ? <EOS> maybe that's an option . <EOS> um keep the primary buttons visible . <EOS> uh make a remote that fits easily in the hands <EOS> and for some design issues uh well , put a logo on it <EOS> and maybe use it uh in some aesthetic uh aesthetic form . <EOS> but uh th the important buttons m make them always accessible and pushable and clear <EOS> and maybe use a touch screen , <EOS> or if that's uh will become too difficult just uh <EOS>
it's probably better . <EOS> yeah , s like underneath uh you can slide it open and you other functions . <EOS> it's may maybe uh a bit stronger as well . <EOS> maybe that's better . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , that's that's a very good point . <EOS>
yeah , <EOS> but it also has a place , <EOS> so <EOS> exactly . <EOS> and it's not stuck down the back of the sofa . <EOS> but then again i d i don't know if this is within our price range or not . <EOS> mm . <EOS> that's a really good idea . <EOS>
yeah <EOS> meeting will close in five minutes . <EOS> okay . <EOS> hmm hmm . <EOS> no <EOS> interface . <EOS> mm . <EOS> no ? <EOS> interface . <EOS> no , <EOS> the industrial designer will take a look at the working design , <EOS> and the in uh usability interaction <EOS> yeah , okay . okay . <EOS>
yes . <EOS> i love excel , <EOS> it's one of my favourite programs . <EOS> yeah , that is pretty neat . <EOS> that kind of thing , <EOS> see . <EOS> you didn't miss out that much . <EOS> i see , mm . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> my inspiration from from last time is the in interior of a remote control being taken apart bit by bit , talking about circuit boards . <EOS> i learned a lot actually . <EOS> i could probably take apart a remote control now if i really needed to . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah <EOS> e e <EOS> power supply is one of the most important things . <EOS> you should <EOS> perhaps you should be able to to switch the control off . <EOS> if you have an l_c_d_ screen that's burns all the time i dunno . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , yeah . yeah . <EOS>
so we will just use a a standard battery ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> and uh the chip we <EOS> chip imprint we know exactly which one we are going to use . <EOS> uh what do you mean by case ? <EOS> i think it's the box that should be spongy , banana's shape . <EOS>
'kay . <EOS> tool training . <EOS> try out the whiteboard , <EOS> every participant should draw their favourite animal and sum up their favourite characteristics of that animal . <EOS> okay . <EOS> um . <EOS> uh miss industrial designer , would you like to go first ? <EOS> okay . <EOS> so are we supposed to bring the little things for the <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> horns , <EOS> draw some horns . <EOS> um i'm from india . <EOS> uh i'm doing my p_h_d_ in psycholinguistics , <EOS> i sit at the department of psychology . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> excellent . <EOS> thanks . <EOS> thank you . <EOS> right , now now it's my turn obviously . <EOS> okay , here's a space . <EOS>
well it has the wee jog-dial <EOS> but <EOS> we had to remove <EOS> yeah , <EOS> so we've had to remove a few of our features we wanted , <EOS> but jog-dial <EOS> mm . <EOS> 's good . <EOS> i'd go with three or four , <EOS> maybe three . <EOS>
help . <EOS> it's up there ? that screen's black . <EOS> alright , okay . okay , that's fine . <EOS> oh god . <EOS> are we done ? <EOS> right , okay um , <EOS> this is our second meeting <EOS> and i might be a bit all over the place . <EOS> um , right our agenda for today , <EOS> do you want us to give you a second ? <EOS>
mm , yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> and the buttons in the middle . <EOS> that isn't rubber . <EOS> okay <EOS> . so , do you think that's more of a three then ? <EOS> three , four ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> four i think . <EOS> well i don't <EOS> what do what <EOS>
no , we don't have the scroll . <EOS> buttons . <EOS> but it's <EOS> well , that's the push-button too , right there . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> but i so i <EOS> this ? <EOS> integrated scroll-wheel or push-button . <EOS> we're really having just push-button interface . <EOS>
well , you know um , <EOS> i kind of think that in general you have to do uh um y you have to have something that's very fashionable , that's uh very attractive that um people see and recognize uh its goal , and uh they immediately wanna have it uh have one of their own . <EOS> so it would really would need to um <EOS> something like the ipod would be good , seems to have caught on fairly well , <EOS> so um d uh <EOS> you know , i don't care what it does , just so it looks cool . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> and uh and uh <EOS> and it is one more point which i noted it down , <EOS> like uh the material which which which is used for remotes should be human friendly <EOS> it should not cause any skin disease or something some al allergy to either children or to um ad adult person . <EOS> and it should have an uh it can have an alarm clock <EOS> a a person if some if somebody wants to get up at around eight eight p_m_ then he can set the time and it can be used as an alarm clock , <EOS> and i don't think it will cost much to set an alarm clock inside a remote . <EOS>
celebrate . <EOS> where do you find that ? <EOS> i have no idea . <EOS> is that the only song you have ? <EOS> there is another one . <EOS> is this one of those media player ? <EOS> huh ? <EOS> yep . <EOS> w <EOS> oh . <EOS> the default track . <EOS> i thought it was david burns , look into the eyeball . <EOS> that's one that seems to be shipping with it uh shipped with for a while , <EOS> maybe this is the new version . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> what would be the cost do do we know ? <EOS> um that's on the next <EOS> i th i think the there wasn't too much difference in the cost , that that related to the actual buttons , <EOS> but it does affect the printed circuit board . <EOS> um which is the next section . <EOS> basically for the circuit board which is the middle , it's just see it down there the chips like the like the workings of the actual um of the remote . <EOS> the firm supplies a simple , a regular and an advanced um circuit board . <EOS> and there's different prices according to each . <EOS> so if we've got the scroll wheel for one of the buttons , that would require a slightly more advanced circuit board than if we just had a standard um push button . <EOS>
ninja homer , made in japan . <EOS> okay . <EOS> mm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> um button . <EOS> uh , apart from that , it's just pretty much the same as we discussed last time . <EOS> mm 'kay . <EOS> and there isn't uh d it doesn't open up to the advanced functions ? <EOS> so the advanced functions are still hidden from you , but they're hidden in the sense that um they're not in use . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> about the components design . <EOS> um for the energy source we can use a basic battery <EOS> or , a as an optional thing , a kinetic energy , like in a watch , <EOS> which you just shake and it produces energy . <EOS> but if we choose for that option , the docking station would c become obsolete . <EOS> so i don't think it's really an option . <EOS> uh for the casing , uh the uh manufacturing department can deliver uh a flat casing , single or double curved casing . <EOS> it's really up the the design that we're gonna use . <EOS> it's uh doesn't uh imply any technical restrictions . <EOS> uh as a case supplement , we could um , i thought of that l later , uh a rubber uh belt , like a anti-slip . <EOS> uh for the b buttons , we can use plastic or rubber . <EOS> and the chip-set , um it says simple here , <EOS> but it should be advanced , <EOS> because we're using an l_c_d_ uh screen . <EOS> and as uh the trend-watcher presentation showed , um people like wood , <EOS> but it raises the price <EOS> and it doesn't really fit the image , unless we would start two product lines . <EOS> form should follow function overall . <EOS> um well the kinetic energy source is rather fancy . <EOS> but depends on what we want . <EOS> i think we should disc discuss that . <EOS> um for the case , uh the supplement and the buttons , it really depends on the designer . <EOS> and the chip-set uh really should be advanced <EOS> because otherwise uh it would really be a simple uh remote control . <EOS> and that's it . <EOS>
s plug yourself in here . <EOS> mm . <EOS> um hit function f_ eight real quickly , <EOS> hold down <EOS> mm . <EOS> looks like you're in okay . <EOS> is it plugged in well ? <EOS> there it goes . <EOS> computer adjusting . <EOS> th <EOS> there you go . <EOS>
uh , as i'm a more an artist <EOS> that's gonna be less technical functions but more user interface and current intentions and everything which is linked with this . <EOS> so next slide please . <EOS> okay . let's go . <EOS> and uh a general method which is seems to be very useful for our task <EOS> is not to forget about uh occam razor . <EOS> we should never complicate things too much . <EOS> we should only make a remote control , nothing more . nothing more than this , just a remote control . <EOS>
okay , my my idea is maybe that the minute it's really hidden , in in other words if it's like in a dark spot , uh meaning you know like a newspaper is on top , a sweater is on top or it it's behind a plant , at that moment it's it's like , it's like um , what you call it a light s sensors , you know ? <EOS> in in that moment it has a sensor , i it it gets a certain darkness , it ge has a sensor and it gives out a signal whether that be a light signal or a beep , <EOS> i mean , that we can discuss that later , you know . <EOS>
so we come again for the the second meeting . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> uh for the aim of this meeting now is to to make presentation about uh the work for each one . <EOS> and take the the decision about the the design and the functionality of the the remote control . <EOS>
it just <EOS> it just kno the ipod knows . s <EOS> if it works on an ipod then it works . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so you just you just can either do this or like you can just touch it if you want . <EOS> huh . <EOS> i don't have one . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yes . <EOS> but it could be someplace really obvious and you still wouldn't be able to find it . <EOS> yeah , of course , <EOS> that didn't <EOS> what with <EOS> well , because you're s because you're silly . because people are silly . <EOS>
well maybe what we're getting into here is the the idea of uh internet through the t_v_ for example . <EOS> so that might play on what we can do . <EOS> yeah <EOS> the they're basically aiming at saying that you would use you know a couple of years ago teletext to be the easiest way to check like for uh uh the scheduling and the next programme and stuff like that <EOS> and now <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> do you think it needs to be bigger to not lose , or does that not factor in ? <EOS> bigger . <EOS> not <EOS> well it needs to be sort of <EOS> like <EOS> hand <EOS> hand held size , yeah . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> mm-hmm . i mean <EOS> it could be <EOS> oh <EOS> uh i was just gonna say uh maybe like the flip phones that they use ? <EOS> have you seen the new mo mobile phones <EOS> that flip out <EOS> and they have the like texting , and then the numbers on one side , <EOS> so <EOS> you could have the most used buttons on top <EOS> and flip it out or something . <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
so the the goal is to have a remote control <EOS> so to have an advantage over our competitors we have to be original , we have to be trendy and we have to also try to be user-friendly . <EOS> so uh the design step will be divided in three uh main points . <EOS> first it will be the functional design . <EOS> third is the conceptual design <EOS> and then is the desired design . <EOS> so the functional design is to identify the main user needs , the technical function the remote control should fulfil . <EOS> and then we will move to f conceptual design where we'll specify the different component involved , what kind of user interf interface we want and what are the different uh trend in user interface and stuff like that . <EOS>
okay. . <EOS> t_v_ . <EOS> okay . <EOS> mm-hmm , mm-hmm . <EOS> sho to to train , okay . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so <EOS> can you just <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm <EOS> mm i think , okay , we're just on time . <EOS> um mm mm .
we do ? <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> uh th that that one ? <EOS> you cannot <EOS> you can save it . <EOS> yeah , maybe . <EOS> wants to , but at least this one . <EOS> i know , we should remove this , <EOS> but it won't h <EOS>
okay . <EOS> teletext has got that option as well . yeah . <EOS> or what about kind of a dual function ? <EOS> in that you've got the basic buttons just for your play , volume , programme things <EOS> and also and then a menu to go into with obvious pictures , obvious symbols and that's where you control recording and things like that . <EOS>
mm . mm-hmm mm-hmm . <EOS> i think but <EOS> we need to be . <EOS> bu y you're a power voter <EOS> uh veto anyway as project manager . <EOS> mm-hmm , i know , <EOS> but <EOS> yeah . . <EOS> yeah <EOS> but the only thing is that what is the multiple functionalities you want to include with that . <EOS>
um i think , it's uh , yeah , i think , it's gonna be par part more of a profit sharing on the product . <EOS> so we're buying fut i mean , we're getting futures in the company . <EOS> yeah , i think i i think that's i think that's the way it's gonna happen at the moment . <EOS>
i have no idea what my favourite animal is . <EOS> 'kay , my favourite animal , <EOS> uh let's see . <EOS> oh . <EOS> it's <EOS> dunno if any of you have seen napoleon dynamite before . <EOS> it's a liger , <EOS> a combination of a lion and tiger . <EOS> have you not seen napoleon dynamite ? <EOS> oh it's a hilarious movie . <EOS> you have to see it . <EOS> and <EOS>
um . <EOS> mm . <EOS> i i would say no , <EOS> because it's gonna add too much to the price . <EOS> especially if we are marketing it as a separate product , people are gonna be paying <EOS> uh , well , uh <EOS> we've got a price limit of was it twelve twelve and a half euros for to produce it ? <EOS> and i wonder if we can get voice recognition into that twelve and a half euros without having to make too many other compromises . <EOS>
right . <EOS> corrine we'll want a product evaluation . <EOS> and the two of you get to play with the uh modelling components and uh <EOS> maybe and and get us a prototype . <EOS> which should go along well with your look-and-feel design and your interface . <EOS> so that <EOS> basically just be working on the prototype , uh we'll accomplish your other two actions . <EOS>
well i have a powerpoint pr presentation stored in my in my personal folder <EOS> here . <EOS> so i i i think you can reach it from here . <EOS> just go to explorer . <EOS> or open . <EOS> oh okay . <EOS> participant two . <EOS> participant two . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> 'kay . fair enough . <EOS> 'kay . <EOS> fine . <EOS> is is there a way that we can use um modern types of polymers , or mo modern types of plastics <EOS> that maybe do have some kind of aesthetic value <EOS> um like <EOS> if a white <EOS> like <EOS> if we talk about <EOS> like well like <EOS> on the lapt on these laptops and other ones they use a a pretty nice , <EOS> you can do i is there some kind of nice colo der quality plastic that we can work with ? <EOS>
check . <EOS> okay . i think it works . <EOS> oh no . <EOS> test test . <EOS> yes , it's working . <EOS> so <EOS> you all read what we are going to do or not ? <EOS> okay . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> we're gonna make a remote control . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> how can you go directly to twenty , for example ? <EOS> no , no , no . <EOS> i if y uh if <EOS> it depend on the the angle you turn the <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . i agree . i agree . <EOS> but i mean if you're fro from two ? <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> how to relate the remote control device , like for example this one i h i'm holding in my hand and the t_v_ . <EOS> so , <EOS> this one is leather bu based <EOS> but <EOS> mm . <EOS> i propose a nifra infrared base <EOS> you know , so so <EOS> for me i think that it is better it's bet it's better to control t_v_ <EOS> so you know , so <EOS> it's it will be cheaper <EOS> and it is less technology than , you know <EOS>
mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i think that if we're if we put our marketing right um we can sell this just like um i don't know if you've heard about it in the news , the the elderly mobile phone ? <EOS> so <EOS> yeah . <EOS> it's a big success . <EOS>
yeah , okay . <EOS> maybe we could start with the black and white . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> that that way we could upgrade later . <EOS> and you could <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , we talked about kinetic charging , <EOS> we've deci seem to have decided on that , <EOS> did we decide on double a_ or triple a_ batteries ? <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> do we already have a cost limit on this , th an idea of how much uh we want to market this for , how much it's gonna sell for , <EOS> that's up that's up to us to decide , eh ? <EOS> th that that's <EOS> yes , that's you have to decide , okay , <EOS> so the best thing is you uh both of uh the christine and you discuss with yourself , okay , and come up with the cost , <EOS> and how we are going to compete in the market , okay , in the the technically , or in the sales wise , okay , the commercial wise , okay . <EOS> then uh we have to design , okay , how long it will take the whole project , okay , how much is going to cost us , and how much we are going to benefit for the company . <EOS> okay , of course it's it's uh of benefit for everybody individually . <EOS> okay , so i think it's uh maybe if we can uh give me some kind of your uh the sales plan , okay , including the technical what uh she's going to talk to you within the team , okay , then it will help me to discuss with the management for further , okay , and put it in the the proper project plan . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> are the costs within budget ? <EOS> well , <EOS> they are now <EOS> that we have our slightly less than capable product . <EOS> we've evaluated it , <EOS> and we can say that we came out with a value of three . <EOS>
of cour of course the most difficult question for the end . <EOS> i'll say five . <EOS> well <EOS> i'll say five . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> twenty five euros . <EOS> cheap . <EOS> i find it quite cheap actually . <EOS> i dunno . if i i it depends , if you live in in switzerland or you live in <EOS>
uh like if this is a like if this is a mobile phone uh we will design casing in such a way like half of , we need not to have a full cover , we will just have a half of cover , <EOS> okay ? <EOS> if somebody wants it i in banana shape , we will fit banana shape casing onto that , so it will give a banana shape look . <EOS> if somebody wanted in apple shape we will design that , we will put we will put apple shape casing on that . <EOS> it will give apple shape look . <EOS> so in that way you can have any , that means whatever you want , <EOS> without uh yeah . <EOS>
uh to frahan . with frahan , <EOS> then you can prepare your slides , <EOS> then present it later . <EOS> i think it's more interesting what he says , <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> exac <EOS> you will had s some more information in <EOS> i think it will be interesting after your presentation to have um baba's presentation . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> uh the innovation is v is very high i think . <EOS> with l_c_d_ . <EOS> and without l_c_d_ ? <EOS> for l_c_d_ . <EOS> both . <EOS> mm for both it's the the same innovations . <EOS> for both . <EOS> it's the same innovation . <EOS> so maybe i can put six to seven . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> 'kay um . <EOS> well . <EOS> t <EOS> a new remote control for t_v_ . <EOS> what would i like ? um . <EOS> w what <EOS> you want it big do you want it small . <EOS> medium . <EOS> are we are we going for like like telephones are going little teeny tiny things or we are going for something that's that's big and <EOS>
bra <EOS> hmm you knocked it up ? <EOS> alright . <EOS> your thing is in where is it ? <EOS> is it in <EOS> thi third third third . <EOS> three , three . <EOS> the end product thingy . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> who wants it ? <EOS> pedro can have it . <EOS>
u_c_ is the central unit ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> y it's a it's this just a chip which does all the um numerical <EOS> okay yeah . <EOS> computation . <EOS> numerical computation according to your display . <EOS> and so for us uh this is quite easy . <EOS> we just need to take <EOS> to define what we want to do when the user interface um wants something <EOS> and after that we just do the coding to s and send that to to to the not the to the television . <EOS> so for us this is quite easy . <EOS>
'kay . <EOS> so . <EOS> yeah ? <EOS> okay . <EOS> . <EOS> . <EOS> um , as far as i'm aware we leave the microphones here , um unless we get told otherwise , <EOS> and just take the laptops with us . <EOS>
so our target group is <EOS> you mentioned um older people ? <EOS> would it just be universal for everyone , you think ? <EOS> because i think even if something has large buttons , as long as they are not childishly large , like even technically <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> it's gonna make it nicer . <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
other parts or uh <EOS> yeah , the buttons <EOS> w like , 'cause there's gonna be the the cover the the rubber or the plastic casing and then the buttons in probably two different colours <EOS> or i if we're having buttons actually , <EOS> i don <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> do you want scroll buttons in that as well ? <EOS> i i was thinking not actually scroll , like a like mouse scroll , <EOS> but you know , a <EOS> i can't quite d uh describe it . <EOS> you see on the one on the right , down at the bottom , is the mouse . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> see where the mouse is , <EOS> like this s style thing where you c have up , down , left and right . and enter in the middle , <EOS>
just if <EOS> what's in the market , <EOS> what's normal , <EOS> uh what kind of uh buttons do you have . <EOS> what do you want to do with your remote control , <EOS> what do you need on your remote control . <EOS> i already wrote some down , some ideas . <EOS>
yes , yes , that's right , it's it's onto the chip , <EOS> most most probably , not not hundred per cent sure about that . <EOS> okay . <EOS> so are there any issues where we place this this chip to make sure you can actually hear the the speaker from the outside of the banana ? <EOS>
we <EOS> ah it's not an univer but it's for all kind of t_v_s ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> well all t_v_s but only t_ only t_v_s i guess . <EOS> so it's universal but for t_v_s . <EOS> so s uh four ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> five . <EOS>
it means cool features , like new features actually . <EOS> that's right . <EOS> which <EOS> for a t_v_ the most important feature which i felt was the locator which is a cool feature . <EOS> and then the scroll buttons are again cool features . <EOS> we don't have l_c_d_ for it but that we decided we don't want to have . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> the other thing is we might be able to handle the simplicity of a remote control and kind of put the more complicated things into a voice control . <EOS> so it could be sold to both the younger market and the older market . <EOS> and the younger market could use kind of the voi voice control method <EOS> and the older market might might k <EOS> exactly <EOS> and might consider the older market could use the simpler design with the traditional buttons and what not . <EOS>
is that ? <EOS> no , it's got it's got it . <EOS> yeah , uh yeah , uh yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> excuse me . <EOS> okay , <EOS> and then f_ five , right ? <EOS> uh , yeah . <EOS> okay . um <EOS> okay , so the interface concept um . <EOS> yeah . the interface specification , <EOS> what people <EOS> um how they interact with it basically , i think . <EOS> um so the method , we looked at existing designs , <EOS> what are the <EOS> what's good about them , what's bad about them , <EOS> um i looked at their flaws , <EOS> so we're going to look at their flaws , everything . <EOS> um and what the survey told us and what we think would be good , <EOS> so a bit of imagination . <EOS> uh the findings , i've got some pictures to show you as well . <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
brilliant . <EOS> very nice . <EOS> for your first powerpoint it's lovely . <EOS> so <EOS> my findings , <EOS> um i just did a preliminary study here <EOS> and uh i found that too much metal in remote design could potentially cause interference with the ability of the remote to send commands . <EOS> and too much metal can cause remotes to behave unexpectedly by receiving false signals . <EOS> um too much metal is used sometimes <EOS> and people pick up radio signals and the like , <EOS> and there's also the possibility of the remote catching on fire <EOS> and injuring the customer , <EOS> just think of those lawsuits , that'd be really bad . <EOS> therefore i suggest primarily plastic construction . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> mm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> well you cou um . <EOS> do you want like a back-up ? <EOS> no , <EOS> one of the decisions we had to make was whether we had double a_ or triple a_ batteries <EOS> 'cause they've still got to be charged this way haven't they ? <EOS> i oh i see . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yes . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yes , the that of course uh i will convince the management to do that , okay . <EOS> that's great . <EOS> it's just something to to keep in mind , <EOS> 'cause it's really really important . <EOS> a lot of products have gone out there without being properly user-tested and completely flopped , <EOS> when in fact it gets re-released a few years down the line with proper testing and it takes off like crazy . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> a cheap one . <EOS> right ? <EOS> 'kay . <EOS> so <EOS> um i guess we should pick the case then . <EOS> if we go with the plasticky case , or the the plastic case , um then the chip-on-print is still kind of , we could have either or . <EOS> we could have a complex one or a a non-complex . <EOS> but did we decide that the rubbery feel was important enough to us ? <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yep . <EOS> and if you see for example righ right now uh uh even the one uh on more than one digit option is for two digit channel which is like ninety nine , <EOS> but tomorrow you might have one fifty channels you know to browse or two hundred channels to browse who knows , <EOS> but uh uh . <EOS> then there is uh <EOS> this is the standard one with without any fancy thing <EOS> you know <EOS> like i it doesn't have teletext option , <EOS> it can without any , <EOS> it's a very simple thing , <EOS> um which which you can vouch . <EOS> and then you have uh what's the v video remote file <EOS> which is like <EOS> usually it has almost all the keys over there <EOS> and , <EOS> but it then it has other options like stop uh and then you play the movie or uh or fo fast forward the movie or something like that so i it has those <EOS> so <EOS> these are the standard uh commonly found remote controls in the uh market . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> i try to organise it by these three . <EOS> . it's it's just my own map so i put everything into the <EOS> yeah yeah yeah . <EOS> i don't really mind . <EOS> i just put the minutes here and we'll see . <EOS> but you got some extra information uh <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> again , this to have some interaction like suppose people use d_s_p_ <EOS> then it particularly sends some information to the chip like in some form , like volume and like this key . <EOS> so it may not be like very expensive , <EOS> because since we are only focusing on t_v_ remote control <EOS> so <EOS> and we have only few things here <EOS>
sure , <EOS> okay , <EOS> right , okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> support for it . <EOS> i mean just <EOS> it's just worth pointing out because like i've i've known i've known people to have kinetic watches that they wear all the time , <EOS> and it's just like magic because it's always powered and there's no battery . <EOS>
so um , presentations , <EOS> were you anybody got , raring to go ? <EOS> raring to go ? <EOS> okay . good stuff . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm . <EOS> um . so how <EOS> oh i need to plug you in . <EOS> s <EOS>
i think so . yeah . <EOS> yeah . yeah . <EOS> yeah very . <EOS> i think one for that . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> no . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . s <EOS> yeah <EOS> i think it's <EOS> you can't really get confused with that . <EOS> i mean , there'll be s we have to work out the uh number the plus system . <EOS> but once that's figured out , it should be fine . <EOS>
tr <EOS> on for true and seven for flase . <EOS> yes . <EOS> yes . <EOS> so uh . so , <EOS> look at these questions . <EOS> is the device f flashy and fashionable ? <EOS> well <EOS> i think most definitely . <EOS> yeah <EOS> i'd say definitely a one yeah . <EOS>
yeah <EOS> and then h we sh mm . <EOS> come on . <EOS> so this is the shape . <EOS> oh . it hasn't <EOS> . it doesn't aim so well . <EOS> okay but the screen is a bit lower <EOS> because if it falls on the other side , it doesn't fall on the screen . <EOS> so there's a layer of rubber on the side . <EOS> so no flipping but just <EOS> no . <EOS>
bouncing on top . <EOS> dunno . okay . um . <EOS> so this is what i've found here , <EOS> um a lot of this is new to me , <EOS> so we'll just read through together . <EOS> um , users dislike the look and feel of current remote controls . <EOS> so they find them ugly . <EOS> most people find them ugly . <EOS> um the vast majority would spend more money for it to look fancy as well , <EOS> we'll see later , the vast majority would spend more money for um slightly more intuitive control , such as voice recognition . <EOS> okay i'm gonna <EOS> we'll look at that in a second . <EOS> um most people use only a f a very slim portion of all the controls . <EOS> so i guess what we're looking at here is people want this h technology , <EOS> they tend to use the most simple controls <EOS> and overall they find remote controls to be something they don't doesn't really appeal to them . <EOS>
ah yeah <EOS> ah okay <EOS> it's pretty . <EOS> okay it's your cat . <EOS> does have a name ? <EOS> caramel . ah-ha . <EOS> caramel . <EOS> and you <EOS> i think i'm too short for the cables . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> olivier , do you want to <EOS>
yeah <EOS> because if you <EOS> on your average um remote , if you press one twice you just go to um or uh say you wanted channel twelve , you press one , and then you go to channel one , and then two then you'd just go to channel two , instead of twelve . <EOS> so if you did like one plus two you could go to channel twelve , or two plus two is channel twenty two . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> um perhaps it's useful , <EOS> perhaps for because people um lose the remote , <EOS> they can yell uh remote where are you and calls or something . <EOS> and perhaps we could uh implement that . <EOS> mm . <EOS> and then i have to go out of the presentation <EOS> because i tried to make some kind of a a idea of how it should look like <EOS> but i can't draw , <EOS> so uh <EOS> don't make too much of it . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah , i think , um <EOS> it'd be interesting to have the b the squishy bit . <EOS> the part that you , yeah , can change into the different , you know , trendy vegetables and fruits . <EOS> but uh it <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> then there should d uh there should be some buttons which can control features like the colour , colour of the picture , the contrast , sharpness , brightness of the picture . <EOS> now there should be a memory switch . <EOS> there should be a mute button . <EOS> suddenly if if if uh uh viewer he gets a telephone call , and if he want he doesn't want to switch off the uh t_v_ , but he he can reduce the sound , <EOS> he can bring the volume down and he can watch he can uh while talking he can watch the t_v_ . <EOS>
cool . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay . um yeah <EOS> we thought of the components it was definitely um a focus of ergonomics and just a single ha handheld device , <EOS> i mean you don't need to use both hands , one hand to hold this and type in with the other , you can just use your thumb . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> wow . <EOS> well , everything else is probably user interface , so . <EOS> yeah , yeah . <EOS> uh yeah . <EOS> and it's the whole thing's made of rubber , is that <EOS> oh yeah . yeah , it has , yeah . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> just a thought . <EOS> um maybe then our market should be t_v_ manufacturers , rather than the public . <EOS> try and sell it t sell it to them to supply with um <EOS> there is that possibility , yes . <EOS> b <EOS> however i don't know exactly where we'll be going with that , <EOS> but it might not even be the avenue of the marketing expert , <EOS> that might be sales , <EOS> who are not in this meeting . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> maybe we have also to have digits or only incremental . <EOS> i dunno bec because if you have the <EOS> no . <EOS> well if it's useful like <EOS> if if you want to change between three channels for example then you h you cannot you cannot cannot work with just memory being incremental . <EOS>
right . <EOS> true . <EOS> mm 'kay . <EOS> okay , right , welcome to meeting b_ . <EOS> um this is gonna go a lot better than the last meeting , basically , <EOS> uh 'cause i know what i'm supposed to be doing now . <EOS> i am your project manager , <EOS> and , uh yeah , i'm just here to <EOS>
stable thing , that's right . to have , <EOS> mm-hmm , mm-hmm . <EOS> but i think it's important , you know , to have two scroll wheels because , you know , you want one for for the channel , but you also want one for for the volume , <EOS> because it's it's the volume i it's , you know it's very handy for it to have uh instant kind of uh feedback uh and response , so . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> we're gonna have the the individual numbers <EOS> and then a menu function <EOS> and maybe sort of a slightly more advanced um instruction booklet to come with it , to guide <EOS> presu uh <EOS> i think it'd be quite hard just for people to grasp um just off like the menu use different buttons <EOS> you maybe have to have like some better instructions of how that would actually work . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> and also i found that young people <EOS> the the younger people are the more interested they are in incorporating new technologies in the in the remote control . <EOS> okay . <EOS> so in my opinion the mando this mando shouldn't be very small <EOS> because the smaller it is , the more like the the liklier it is to get lost . <EOS> liklier or more likely ? <EOS> likely . okay . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> d <EOS> are we including the voice are you glu <EOS> are we including the voice in the end or not ? huh ? <EOS> no . okay . <EOS> uh a four . i i <EOS> no . <EOS> so <EOS> what's your uh grade ? <EOS> four ? <EOS> so we have four , four f and five ? <EOS>
i dunno that we should make the whole thing yellow <EOS> i kinda thought with a you'd have like a yellow circle with the r_r_ in it somewhere on it , <EOS> but i'd <EOS> yellow seems a bit of a strong colour <EOS> to make the ent like the thing <EOS> no , <EOS> but i mean just like white or grey or black or some sort of blah colour . <EOS> yeah , yeah . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm . <EOS> however of course this would be like designing two remotes pretty much . <EOS> so um which then , as i understand it , would probably limit the , limit again the the the use of certain materials , because they would be too expensive . <EOS> say like have a scroll wheel and uh on both of them , or have an l_c_d_ screen and so on so on . <EOS> you'd probably have to stick rather with a just traditional rubber button <EOS>
but banana is not so handy , <EOS> i think that's handier . <EOS> banana is more handier as compared to this i think , and to capsicum . <EOS> well <EOS> but like a banana you can you can be holding like this and have the scroll wheel kind of on top <EOS> and just <EOS>
oh . <EOS> what's that ? <EOS> yeah , that's correct . <EOS> 'kay , down here , case material . <EOS> plastic . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> it's plastic . <EOS> we <EOS> plastic . <EOS> and special colour . <EOS> and special colour . <EOS> 'kay . <EOS> down here , interface type . <EOS> we're gonna have the integrated scroll scroll wheel . <EOS> isn't <EOS> oh those are just regular buttons . <EOS>
'kay . <EOS> ah , yeah . <EOS> okay simple . <EOS> did you did you ever use the like the timing of turning on the t_v_ , <EOS> well and based on your <EOS> very , yeah okay , very occasionally . <EOS> but i do use the i do use the display of the time quite often , but <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> i dunno . <EOS> well <EOS> uh how much is your uh standards uh mobile phone recharger ? <EOS> i dunno . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> if you buy it uh separately from your phone it's probably expensive , <EOS> but i don't know what the project uh projection costs are for such a thing . <EOS>
okay <EOS> . so uh my one , it uh should be in the shared folder . <EOS> the other presentations . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so . <EOS> it was last time i saw it . <EOS> and it is . <EOS> okay . <EOS> so , <EOS> just move to the next slide . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah , yeah , <EOS> that user friendly <EOS> or <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm . <EOS> that's the converse to having zillions of button <EOS> where each button does only one thing . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS>
what is that ? <EOS> mm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> right . <EOS> 'kay . <EOS> no , okay . <EOS> um the manufacturing division also has said that um they have several types of chips <EOS> and they've just developed a sample sensor or sample speaker chip , which we could utilise . <EOS> um push button requires a simple chip and scroll requires more complicated chip . <EOS> so depends on what we decide we wanna do . <EOS>
it's um switching between channels , sort of randomly going through . <EOS> oh , right . <EOS> but you have that little thing that comes up at the bottom and tells you what's on . <EOS> um okay , fifty percent of users say they only use ten percent of the buttons , <EOS> so that's going back to what , you know , we were saying earlier about , you know , do you need all the buttons on the remote control , <EOS> they just make it look ugly . <EOS> okay ? cool . <EOS> um so this is my little graph thing . <EOS>
. <EOS> you can just see what's up . <EOS> wow . <EOS> yeah <EOS> it's it's really deep . <EOS> hold on . <EOS> takes a little while to get excited to load . <EOS> that <EOS> the excel thing is pretty cool . <EOS> here , <EOS> like , basically <EOS> it's like inspiration , <EOS> basically <EOS> i'm gonna give you two sentences on fashion and <EOS>
um i think the important points we have to t talk about are uh it's functional design , it's conceptual design , and desail detailed design . <EOS> and for that we're going um all to work individually and then have meeting during the whole day . <EOS> um , so let's try the whiteboard . <EOS> um so any of you who want to go . <EOS>
not <EOS> j uh just a point to the energy th things . <EOS> if we use the batteries , and the additional so solar cell , then it's okay for l_ uh speech recognition and l_c_d_ , <EOS> so no problem in energy , i think . <EOS> okay . <EOS> so <EOS> okay . <EOS>
um , i just got the project announcement about what the project is . <EOS> designing a remote control . <EOS> that's about it , didn't get anything else . <EOS> did you get the same thing ? <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . yeah , that's that's it . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> there is mobile phones , in which you can change the colour also of the lights . <EOS> maybe we should consider this function . <EOS> to customise it and so <EOS> i mean kids can make it look more flashy with different kinds of colours <EOS> and people who want something , you know , different , or more uh design , they can go for one colour <EOS> like uh for example this uh photo th camera . <EOS>
yeah , one . <EOS> pineapple bee . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so push button then it's it's the next expensive one . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> an but we have integrated scroll wheel with push dut button . <EOS> and i think this is one . <EOS> integrated scroll wheel push button <EOS> . so we'll we have only one ? <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> ah , n . <EOS> if it drops to the floor then it starts to scream . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> also if y when you take the the remote control , for example on the table , you take it and you push the button and everything is very loud , and <EOS>
i dunno . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> b <EOS> maybe it's that that's a little too hard to make . especially for that kind of money . <EOS> because it's i it has to be <EOS> yeah . <EOS> production cost is uh t uh twelve and a half . <EOS>
'cause you'll have to like <EOS> but you can quickly s you can <EOS> yeah . <EOS> they have to r wheel really fast . <EOS> but i think the wheel goes through like a hundred channels , <EOS> at least on theirs . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
yeah , but uh see , we ought to take a few considerations , okay , <EOS> one is the price consideration , one is future consideration , okay , like uh you can eat uh you can all eat more chi i can eat more chilli , okay , <EOS> so i it's a depends on the individual taste , you know , <EOS> so we have we have to balance somewhere . <EOS>
i <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> but i th i think regardless we're we're aiming for the under sixty five or something . <EOS> under sixty five , okay , <EOS> that's a good start . um . <EOS> yep . <EOS> i'd say we're uh <EOS> can we narrow it down to maybe um teenagers and families ? <EOS> 'cause that would go up to like fifty ? <EOS>
mm . <EOS> yeah <EOS> but it can be on the display in in a corner all the time on the remote . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah that's okay , that's true . <EOS> okay , so no time button . okay . <EOS> no time on . <EOS> and uh do we need to include anything about the speech recognition and the speech commands , or ? <EOS>
what's the big blue thing ? <EOS> that's the lock button , <EOS> has a l_ l_ on it <EOS> and then the m_ is a mute button . <EOS> and then it also has digit <EOS> oh cool . <EOS> what button ? <EOS> um . oh mute . <EOS>
that's the logo of the <EOS> yeah . <EOS> it's th th right now it's only r_ r_ , but uh <EOS> logo , okay . <EOS> okay well <EOS> full screen . <EOS> i would have recognised it if it were the right colours of course . <EOS> shit . <EOS>
is that previous work ? <EOS> yeah , this one . <EOS> i challenge you . <EOS> oh , that's so stupid . <EOS> no , that doesn't work . <EOS> no , you gotta use the magic pen . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> what if i put one there ? <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> okay <EOS> you so you can build a kind of black box <EOS> and put it on t_v_ and just to recognize gestures and voice . <EOS> devic <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah <EOS> but so you need a camera and you know a microphone inside your remote control . <EOS>
yeah , <EOS> but l like menu functions or <EOS> yeah . <EOS> ah okay . <EOS> wouldn't it be better to make just one big touch screen , uh one one small uh touch screen uh applet <EOS> and uh i'll just make um uh let's say fifteen buttons on it , <EOS> and uh we have three of those , uh actually just uh menus with sub-menus , with or sub-items , sub-functions . <EOS>
okay , blank . <EOS> no no , the new one . <EOS> oh . <EOS> uh they just don't save it . <EOS> um <EOS> i know uh . <EOS> a house ? <EOS> yeah , you have to use the pen s stupid . <EOS> you have to save everything , <EOS> you know that , huh ? <EOS>
yes . <EOS> but is something that's seven centimetres square e easy to hold ? <EOS> w i i think so . <EOS> i if the roller buttons are on the side you don't have to catch it like that , but just like this , and you know follow follow <EOS> well , that's that's no task for me , <EOS> but well seven to seven at least yeah , <EOS> but <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm 'kay um . <EOS> and you will get specific instructions sent by your personal coach . <EOS> i realised in this past one we we didn't have much , <EOS> we just wanted to get a little brain-storming done . <EOS> um so very exited to see all your animals <EOS> and how what wonderful um artists we all are um . <EOS>
the infra-red . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> right . <EOS> um what a what alternatives do we have to that ? <EOS> y um <EOS> what alternatives do we have to the chip on print ? <EOS> well , if if it's not chip on print then , i guess , you get different chip components , and you build them separately and doesn't include the infra-red . <EOS> it's less expensive mm <EOS>
about the <EOS> about what ? <EOS> um . <EOS> i i'm part of design , perhaps . <EOS> uh , what is most important in a in a remote control ? <EOS> what is the most important function aspect ? <EOS> uh . <EOS> you mean the external or <EOS>
yeah , <EOS> uh becau uh when you lose the <EOS> yeah , <EOS> but what what else what else uh do you want to scrap ? <EOS> f <EOS> you have to we have to scrap four points . <EOS> i don't know . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> that's difficult . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> uh i didn't <EOS> oh yeah . <EOS> so these are the <EOS> oh , okay . yeah . <EOS> so these are the um last notes we i made . <EOS> if anything doesn't look right , just say it to me then . <EOS> i don't have to put it in the report . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> what did we think of the meeting room , <EOS> i guess is an important thing here . <EOS> these cables suck . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah , this falls off <EOS> and uh the white board worked really well without any pro <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
maybe call is enough . <EOS> but yeah . <EOS> yeah yeah yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> what if it had something like um just like a magnet on the back of it <EOS> and you could <EOS> i mean j just to have some place to put it besides like a base . <EOS> you know like a portable phone has a base , <EOS> like just to have a home for it . <EOS> 'cause people just stick it on top of their t_v_ , but the point of having a remote is not to have to walk over to the t_v_ , so <EOS>
okay it's gonna have to be plastic . <EOS> and <EOS> no it's no chip . <EOS> this is just radio frequency . <EOS> th this is no chip . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah but <EOS> no . there's no chip there . <EOS> it just emits the signal . <EOS> and the receiver accepts it and that's it . <EOS>
yeah uh not really . <EOS> small cobra . <EOS> no , it just small cobra , yeah . <EOS> uh-huh . <EOS> is that a worm ? or <EOS> it's co c quite recognisable . <EOS> what about you uh <EOS> christa ? <EOS> uh yeah <EOS> christa pavlov mm . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> a nice one . <EOS> attractive . <EOS> such like this , there are several uh examples in the slides . <EOS> i'm not sure the one in the middle is very attractive . <EOS> it's very big , <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> it's very , <EOS> you know <EOS> if you're <EOS>
maybe . <EOS> 'cause that's the uh the biggest expense there , right . <EOS> got two of them <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> and why why i've got it two , i don't know , <EOS> i can't seem to select any more however . <EOS> okay . <EOS> well we can work around that <EOS> um <EOS>
uh material , i think kate's gonna tackle that quite a bit , <EOS> but i think we have two different options , <EOS> because we did make a another one , <EOS> which wa uh is in the shape of banana , <EOS> it's just <EOS> if you can imagine this as yellow with black buttons , like just like this but in the shape of a banana , <EOS> which is also nice <EOS> and easy to hold <EOS> and feels good <EOS> and has a similar sort of scroll push button technology , <EOS> just a slightly different design . <EOS> also with on off switch and infrared <EOS> uh i had envisioned it in hard smooth plastic . <EOS>
because <EOS> um i mean e even if <EOS> i mean not necessarily that the um the whole body has to be of the company colour , <EOS> so you know um blue and yellow tend to go to we well together . <EOS> so you have the main body blue with the yellow logo and slogan running up one side of it kind of thing . <EOS>
mmm-hmm mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah yeah . <EOS> now um <EOS> the the scroll wheel is is much more useful if you have an l_c_d_ screen , <EOS> and this brings us to the the point you were mentioning before about the internet uh capability . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> one possibility , if we <EOS> now we need to still talk about the price point <EOS> because obviously a lot of this stuff can't be done for twenty five eu uh euro , <EOS> but one possibility is to download program information into the l_c_d_ screen <EOS> so that instead of actually saying i want to i want to go to channel thirty seven because i know this programme's on , <EOS> you know , often you don't know what ch what channel it's on , or you don't know what's on . <EOS> if you have a list of of programs on your l_c_d_ screen you just scroll to that program rather than to a channel . <EOS> so if you think about it's kind of like a you know in mobile phones now you don't use you don't remember people's phone number , you remember their name and you go find that name and ring it . <EOS> so this would be pretty kind of a handy thing to have , <EOS> but um we we really need t to discuss the price . <EOS>
i <EOS> yeah , that's ts how i tend to do it . <EOS> but then the buttons would have to be very small . <EOS> don't you think ? <EOS> yeah , <EOS> 'cause otherwise your fingers can't move around . <EOS> but i like i <EOS> no <EOS> just thumb-sized . <EOS> jus <EOS>
right . <EOS> i think we've all managed to master the whiteboard there by looks of it , <EOS> so , <EOS> on to it . <EOS> project finance . as you can see , twelve point five euros per unit . <EOS> that's not a terrible lot as far as i'm aware , <EOS> and we're hoping to sell them for twenty five . <EOS> if we're aiming for fifty million euros we're gonna have to be selling an awful lot of them . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so the colour is yellow . <EOS> i think it's uh <EOS> we defined everything according to what we should what the decision we should take , yeah . <EOS> so maybe we can um <EOS> we can uh work on those aspects uh until next meeting . <EOS> so have the final uh look and feel design according to the decision . <EOS> and have the the user interface design and uh then evaluate the prodyuc the product . <EOS> that is to say , uh check if it fit the the requirement uh given by the users , <EOS> but according to uh your presentation it seems to be okay . <EOS> it seems to be fancy , innovative , and easy to use . <EOS>
but it's still too big i think , in your hand . yeah . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> and would it even resemble fruit that way ? <EOS> i mean <EOS> yeah like certain ones you'd have to limit the fruit selection , <EOS> like you could probably do a strawberry still . <EOS> i think the broccoli would be out . <EOS>
so <EOS> i'm first going to do an opening then we get used to one anothers <EOS> and we speak about this tool we're going to design and try to make a project plan , <EOS> some discussion and then we talk of uh the next meeting . <EOS> so um we want to to do a new remote control . <EOS> it has to be original , trendy and user friendly . <EOS>
no . <EOS> no . <EOS> it it it you'll be you know be affected by the by the other speech and <EOS> if the t_v_ is working , <EOS> yeah . <EOS> that's just <EOS> i mean it'll if somebody says up in the middle of a television show , it's gonna change the channel .
's also look cool . <EOS> mm . <EOS> in fact we might like to put a slogan on , <EOS> and um possibly the two r_s to signify the company . rather than real reaction . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm . yeah . <EOS> i thought the uh the d the double arc could perhaps uh be the uh the enter button . <EOS>
yeah well pl the base station is made out of m many units of plastic . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> that's right . <EOS> so might be ninety centimes for the the remaining things which the cord and everything which'll go <EOS> exactly exactly <EOS> so we have margin for that stuff . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> probably , i would say , probably not worth the investment at this point in time . <EOS> so maybe we should just do away with speech recognition . <EOS> um and that way we can focus on our form . <EOS> i did have have a thought about the sort of the tracking thing . <EOS> is that <EOS> if it came with maybe a holder or holster , whatever you wanna call it . <EOS> um that you you should put it back in . your remote . <EOS> but if you don't put it back in , you press something like a little button on that , <EOS> and that just sort of sends out a beep to find where it is or something . just by infrared . <EOS> that shouldn't be too complex i would've thought . <EOS>
yeah , <EOS> i have <EOS> instead of scrolling here we have two buttons here , up for up and down . <EOS> on the side . <EOS> mm uh it sounds good actually , yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay , yeah . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> i th i think it's not it's not like it's a pen . <EOS> but then then i think left-handed people are already used to discrimination anyway , <EOS> so they just <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , but i mean because it's not like it's a pen , you know , <EOS> left-handed people can't normally write right-handed , <EOS> but they can normally do most things right-handed , <EOS> so i would say it's not such a big issue . <EOS>
what , just like in terms of like the wealth of the country ? <EOS> like how much money people have to spend on things like ? <EOS> just a chara just a characteristic of the <EOS> just <EOS> or just like , basic product podi positioning , <EOS> the twenty five euro remote control might be a big hit in london , <EOS> might not be such a big hit in greece , <EOS> who knows , <EOS> something like that , yeah . <EOS>
right . <EOS> what would you recommend ? <EOS> however , <EOS> well , we only wanna sell it for twenty five euro <EOS> right ? <EOS> 'cause i was thinking if we wanted to get the high in market then you could produce a few in titanium , <EOS> make them a rarity so to speak . <EOS>
on the international market . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah , we're to sell two million then . <EOS> wow . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm for a production cost of mm twelve fifty euros maximum . <EOS> 'kay . <EOS> so any of you have experience in remote controls ? <EOS>
like that . <EOS> i'm just going to describe . <EOS> basically we have a a battery a power supply here . <EOS> after that we just have um user interface . <EOS> let's say that <EOS> um <EOS> something like that , <EOS> which could be um a l_c_d_ let's say or um an array of push button , something like that . <EOS> push button or a l_c_d_ . <EOS> after that we we feed that into um uh an electronic chip . <EOS> so i say u_c_ and i feed that to uh l_e_d_ which is uh infrared um which is a an infrared um component . <EOS> and so what we <EOS> for for myself this <EOS> for for us this is quite easy . <EOS>
i think it does . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i mean <EOS> yeah , <EOS> so y so we we might do we might want to do like a uh another m model another another version , which is like exactly the mirror image of this one . <EOS> alright . <EOS>
and i'm alastair <EOS> and i'm the project leader . <EOS> alright okay , <EOS> so tool training . <EOS> um . <EOS> project plan . <EOS> so does anyone have any uh thoughts as to the tool training that uh is required ? <EOS> tool training . <EOS> i'm not exactly sure what you mean by tool training . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> silly for children . <EOS> yeah , for children , yeah exactly . <EOS> yeah , that's what , yeah . <EOS> like an animal or <EOS> like a doll , or <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , exactly . yeah . <EOS> and and the butto buttons also i think if you want to have more features in your remote controller then there should be more buttons . <EOS> if there are more buttons then it will be more complicated . <EOS> if you have less features then your remote controller won't be attractive , <EOS> so i think uh we need to make some buttons which are which are like um uh f in uh in intended for two or three operations , <EOS> like if you press one button in one mode then it will change the channel , if you press the other button in another mode it will change the colour . <EOS> so if you want to have less buttons we can have that option but i think it will complicate the matter more i think so . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> and it's it's it's <EOS> well <EOS> i don't think we're actually charging a particular premium anyway , in the end , so <EOS> i i i think it will tend to appeal more to younger aged groups <EOS> just 'cause we have gone with the fashion focus <EOS> and the younger people tend to would be more conscious of that aspect of it , <EOS> but um i think it should still appeal on a certain level to everybody , yeah . <EOS>
okay . um . good . <EOS> so guys let this uh wonderful thing . <EOS> okay so we can go to the slides . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> oh yeah . <EOS> sorry . um . <EOS> number three . <EOS> oh number two <EOS> sorry . <EOS> which is <EOS>
we should use <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah w we need very primary colours , like bright red , bright yellow . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah but the primary colours w we can uh create with the with the leds on the on the remote control . <EOS> if you we uh yeah . <EOS> if you make it uh just a yeah bl give it a blue colour , then it's just a neutral colour , <EOS> also for the for the more uh yeah for the people . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> i am corinne whiting <EOS> and i will be the marketing expert <EOS> and in each of the three phases i will have a different role . <EOS> in the function design phase i will be talking about user requirement specification , <EOS> and this means what needs and desires are to be fulfilled , <EOS> and i'll be doing research to figure this out . <EOS> in the conceptual design phase i will be dealing with trend watching <EOS> and i'll be doing marketing research on the web . <EOS> and then finally in the um detailed design phase i will be doing product evaluation <EOS> and so i will be collecting the requirements <EOS> and ranking all the requirements to see how we did . <EOS>
um , yeah , <EOS> maybe another problem uh , <EOS> i think current t_v_s can even send infrared . <EOS> yes , <EOS> but what should we uh s i i i f <EOS> i agree with you , <EOS> but should we spend money or and time on building a receiver into the uh remote control ? <EOS> 'cause that would be i mean extra components , extra designs , um larger g uh remote control . <EOS> these all uh all stuff that we have to take in account . <EOS> so i i my personal opinion is no no no receiver at all . <EOS> um , well <EOS> we should uh look into the design and the functionability . <EOS> like i said , uh use one button for instance for m multiple functions , <EOS> or well uh <EOS> just hide the few buttons o of switching it open or something , the usual uh stuff . <EOS> and uh don't overbuild , <EOS> we shouldn't make a big uh remote control for simple functions , <EOS> but we we should stick to the basics . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> um the components are exactly the same . <EOS> um i think , like what you guys said , um the most input that's needed is basically in the user interface . <EOS> the rest of the components um they do have an impact in terms of cost and complexity . <EOS> um like you said time to market was a problem , <EOS> um and how many components are physically in there in cost . <EOS>
and we're going to raise what's called a sp a spreadsheet <EOS> that they provided to me . <EOS> um and <EOS> it says fill in the number of components you plan to use in your device . <EOS> hand dynamo , battery , kinetic , solar cells . <EOS> okay . <EOS>
i think you have to uh change your desktop uh <EOS> okay . <EOS> size . <EOS> ooh . <EOS> 'kay . everybody ready ? <EOS> not really . <EOS> sorry . <EOS> well <EOS> computer is uh not functioning ? <EOS> no no no . yes yes yes . <EOS>
no . <EOS> so , <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> faster . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> an <EOS> yeah , <EOS> more information about the costs . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , that will be handy . <EOS> first of all i didn't think uh that we were able to make an l_c_d_ screen uh first point , <EOS> but uh it was possible <EOS> uh uh , yeah . <EOS>
so , <EOS> we want something fancy , <EOS> as uh previously said , florent , <EOS> something very easy to use , powerful <EOS> and also as uh it's written here , <EOS> seventy five percent of users , they zap lot , <EOS> so maybe just having many functions in one button is not that good if you want to zap a lot . <EOS>
four ? <EOS> well we have good reasons for it , <EOS> so we but we can still put a <EOS> hum . <EOS> a four ? <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay , <EOS> and final question . <EOS> um , did we stay true to our motto and put the fashion into electronics ? <EOS> current trends of fruits and veggies , desire for sponginess . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> 'kay . <EOS> what about um you know with the touch screen computers yeah , yeah that's what i was just yeah . <EOS> yeah ? um so you it's like a little panel that you touch rather than a button <EOS> which shouldn't wear out as much either , <EOS> not sure about the <EOS>
but <EOS> and it's not too complex to do it . <EOS> well <EOS> they uh they all have to be programmed to fit your t_v_ <EOS> and that that is bit of a tricky job . <EOS> i actually use one of those <EOS> when <EOS> they are they are kinda kinda troublesome , <EOS> but but the thing is whe when you uh start uh building something like this you have to build a receiver into the uh t into the remotes , <EOS> because uh in order for the remote to process something from the t_v_ , like uh to synchronise and you have to send and receive , <EOS> and that's well <EOS>
alright . <EOS> right . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> just <EOS> yeah , yeah . <EOS> the features could be same and the body could look slightly different . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm . <EOS> so <EOS> what about <EOS> you were talking about the buttons , <EOS> um the controls that are coming out now have kind of big , rubber buttons , <EOS> not tiny little one , big , rubber buttons , <EOS> but what about , i mean , 'cause we got to make it original ,
do you wanna be next or you want kate to go next ? <EOS> i think possibly it might be more useful if kate went next . <EOS> okay , <EOS> we'll move the <EOS> um <EOS> you can even have them in different flavours as well . <EOS> so that if you just wanna sit there and chew on the remote , it could be like pear flavour , <EOS> yeah . scratch and sniff . <EOS>
no . <EOS> mm i think you're supposed to , yeah . <EOS> is the white <EOS> okay . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> i guess you can . <EOS> wow . <EOS> that's cobra . <EOS> ah , a kind of uh snake ? <EOS> cobra ? <EOS> exactly . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> and further instructions will be uh will be sent to you by uh by email . <EOS> two or three prototypes ? <EOS> two ? <EOS> two . <EOS> two . <EOS> one for like cost and the one with like higher-end <EOS> so that then we can be easily comparing them <EOS> or you know find a compromise between both of them , <EOS> yeah that's how it is . <EOS>
yeah . programme it . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> uh <EOS> so this are the they have to work together ? <EOS> or ? do they have to work together or two separate choice <EOS> no . <EOS> well , th the f_p_g_a_ will produce the the data to send . <EOS>
yes i am . <EOS> thank you . <EOS> i don't have any emails . this means i can go home . <EOS> oh , we all leave . <EOS>
p press f_ five to start it first . <EOS> sorry . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> jesus . <EOS> okay . yeah , i can , okay . <EOS> uh then uh the methodology i adopted to find out all this was market survey . <EOS> a a detailed market survey on consumers was done to find out their likings and dislikings , what they prefer what they not prefer , w what problems they do encounter in all this type of things . <EOS> and what we got was , we found that if you uh , what they th what problems they are having with different uh remote controls available in the market . <EOS> seventy five percent of users they do find it that the remote controls available in the market are ugly . <EOS> they are not so good looking . <EOS> so , we have to put stress on this , <EOS> uh we have to take care of this fact also like our design , uh should be appropriate , should be good looking for the consumers . <EOS> and yes that's wi uh this will definitely , this can definitely put uh uh enhance our sales . <EOS> uh and even uh the good thing about this is that eighty percent of users they are willing to pay high uh pay more for this uh good looking remote controls also . <EOS> so even if the available market goes for the available <EOS> uh even if the market goes for the available remote control is less even then we can sell it at twenty five euros , <EOS> which maybe which may seem quite high but if our looks are are if the re remote control we design have a good better uh better look uh designs , then we can hope that consumers will prefer these g remote controls . <EOS> then <EOS>
no , <EOS> but we're going to th make this f for a all kind of people , <EOS> so it it it has to be <EOS> and would it be easy for them to use the speech recognition ? <EOS> yeah , okay , <EOS> but so they could <EOS> uh i think it is . if they read a manual . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> they're standard , aren't they ? <EOS> no <EOS> um they're <EOS> well in the sense that these are all the options available for you . <EOS> i'll explain to you the complexity and the cost thing again a bit later . <EOS> okay um then there's um how the case actually looks . <EOS> it can actually be flat or it can be curved , <EOS> um and then the different types of materials that you can use , <EOS> um i don't think you can use them in a combination , <EOS>
mm . i'd give it a three for this for that . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i mean the menus thing is something you don't normally see on um on a remote , <EOS> but you see it in a lot of other places . <EOS> no need for teletext . <EOS>
it <EOS> i though it was brilliant no ? <EOS> really ? <EOS> no mine was really helpful as in my stuff was quite helpful i think . <EOS> i think it depends on the role <EOS> no ? <EOS> yeah it probably does . <EOS> so like a f <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> there also seems to be um a trend towards a spongy feel to materials , <EOS> uh again in contrast to last year . <EOS> um <EOS> yep . <EOS> let's start from the inside and work our way out . fine . it's okay with me . <EOS>
'kay . <EOS> so um <EOS> i thank you for this meeting . <EOS> and i think we have a lunch-break now . <EOS> that's good . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so <EOS> that's a good thing . <EOS>
if you don't wanna tire out your thumbs after all . <EOS> and then you can use your thumb . <EOS> and it was partly we thought the design looked better , <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i could see this thing , unless it's reinforced , having a problem with the <EOS>
hmm . <EOS> yeah . yeah , yeah . <EOS> like a little cut-out kind of <EOS> yeah . <EOS> right . <EOS> that's like , you know , a a cellphone it's like the the screen is always just left opened . <EOS> okay . <EOS> right . <EOS> and so , what we are gonna do it like bright yellow with the r_r_ ? <EOS>
but um , i've just indicated here , we could have actually two scroll wheels , <EOS> 'cause i think the scroll wheel is a fairly um key part of , you know , <EOS> i think everyone has has agreed that it's that it could be quite a useful um thing , so . <EOS>
em <EOS> oh my god , it's better than what i'm gonna be able to do . <EOS> take my contraptions with me . <EOS> alright , <EOS> i'm jessy . <EOS> i'm from around d_c_ ish sort of in the u_s_ . <EOS> and we're gonna keep the deep sea sort of theme going on , animal . <EOS> don't really know how to draw this . <EOS> just where can i <EOS> mm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> maybe if i do the water , <EOS> but how ? <EOS>
i mean you can do it , <EOS> you it's <EOS> it doesn't seem that hard . <EOS> i don't know . <EOS> i believe it's ins it's gotta be inside the t_v_ , not inside the remote . <EOS> i mean it would y would that would be <EOS> they already do it . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> how would that work ? <EOS> so <EOS> you've got say maybe a v_c_r_ and a t_v_ which are separate , <EOS> so you <EOS> on my one at home i've got a v_c_r_ remote <EOS> which then changes the channel on the v_c_r_ <EOS> and doesn't do anything on the t_v_ , <EOS> so is it gonna be like a switch on the remote that says t use the t_v_ or use the v_c_r_ ? <EOS> or does it know which one you want to use ? <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> no no . <EOS> mm well <EOS> one i've had before , a r r remote control we have at home is one that's actually got a cover on the bottom <EOS> so the bottom bit is just , covers half the keys most of the time , <EOS> and then you can slide the cover back to get to the the more advanced keys . <EOS>
the minutes . <EOS> okay , so <EOS> we just talked about uh <EOS> oh you want me to show that there <EOS> or <EOS> uh <EOS> no , <EOS> just tell us . <EOS> mm no . <EOS> okay , <EOS> we just talked about it looks . <EOS> has to look nice . <EOS> usability is very important . <EOS> people don't want to spend money on something that's similar to cheaper ones . um <EOS> it has to be very basic , <EOS> not too many buttons . <EOS> light switches on if you use a button . <EOS> uh text t_v_ still has to be a possibility . <EOS> and it has to be easy to learn . <EOS> that were the things i uh make minutes of . <EOS> and the functions are volume , channel to choose channels , an on-off , a mute uh button , and a text t_v_ button . that are the functions . <EOS> that right ? <EOS>
yep . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> is that alright with everybody else ? <EOS> especially since kate asked to be last . <EOS> sarah , i'm sorry if i misspelled your name , <EOS> i didn't know whether it was s_a_r_a_ or s_a_r_h_ . <EOS> i respond to either . <EOS> no worries . <EOS>
and the speech uh shall we implement that ? <EOS> or uh <EOS> yeah well <EOS> we just heard about the new uh technology , huh ? <EOS> yeah <EOS> i think it's it's easy for that , <EOS> where are you , but then it says i'm here . <EOS>
yeah , that's right , <EOS> and you <EOS> one colour per remote . <EOS> so then it is one . <EOS> yeah , indeed , yeah . <EOS> you don't need four of those uh four of those special colours in one in one remote . <EOS> yeah , okay okay , true . true , true . <EOS>
uh as you know , i am mister ramaro . <EOS> i am an expert in uh industrial design of all electronic devices <EOS> and i previously devised many uh like digital calculators and electronic calculators . <EOS> so now i'll briefly describe the working design of our remote control . <EOS> well , <EOS> as you know the basic function of remote control is sending some message to the the device , like t_v_ or v_c_r_ or d_v_d_ player etcetera . <EOS> so we will have a p portable device which will send message to the the main device like t_v_ . <EOS> so we need to have some energy source to do what to do the functions , what we want on this portable device . <EOS> and usually this <EOS> so to do these functions we need an interface , <EOS> which basically some kind of pressing buttons or keys or like moving jack or something like that . <EOS> and then these messages these key buttons can be transferred into some kind of message <EOS> and then it will process by the chip <EOS> and then it will generate some information to the main device . <EOS> it's generally in the form of infrared or some kind of s sensor information . <EOS> then we will have the main control in the main device to do the particular action what we want . <EOS>
or at least <EOS> yeah <EOS> i don't know if it's really the scroll , <EOS> but the menu they like most , <EOS> and i think you can never get through a menu great with a scroll uh <EOS> fast , <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah i think it is is faster . <EOS> becau <EOS> i think the scroll's easier if you have a lot of options , <EOS> but if you don't have a lot of option then <EOS>
but would we <EOS> yeah . what i understand about scroll wheels is they're they're quite expensive to to make . <EOS> so i d <EOS> yeah . <EOS> th they are gonna be more expensive , <EOS> but on the other hand , i mean , it i mean it is an alternative if if you think that's gonna sell some some uh you know <EOS> if if we're gonna make up the extra cost by extra sales i think maybe it's worth it to do it , <EOS> but i mean i would just use if i was gonna do this i would just use the scroll wheel for s channels up and channels down . <EOS> i don't think volume <EOS> or do you think volume would be <EOS>
so it's either um the scroll-wheel or the push-buttons . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> s yeah , push buttons . <EOS> what about the just developed uh sample sensor ? <EOS> i think push-buttons is <EOS> what about what ? <EOS> g there , the sample sensor , sample speaker thing . <EOS>
so there you go , yeah . <EOS> uh but do the younger generation have the money ? <EOS> they they don't . <EOS> it's older generation , they're the ones that have gone out and <EOS> no i would i would say the older the older people , yeah . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> but in other things , i think it'd be really good . <EOS> i thi <EOS> yeah , that's awesome . <EOS> um okay , <EOS> closing . <EOS> are the costs within the budget ? <EOS> is the project evaluated ? <EOS> now <EOS> there's the final questionnaire and meeting summary . <EOS> um so , <EOS> this is the great product kids , <EOS> i think we've created something really interesting <EOS> and that we have a market for it , um especially if we can produce it at twelve point three <EOS> which we hope um <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> uh , so we can have it at one of the boundaries so that things are slightly better . <EOS> as <EOS> or as hearing is concerned , we can have some gap at some place , <EOS> so that <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so that's something we have to keep in mind with the actual physical design is to keep the the speaker close enough to the outside . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> but we lose the locator . <EOS> well we're going to have a beeping thing . <EOS> but yeah , it's it's not like sample speaker , but it will just beep , <EOS> so we still have the locate . <EOS> really ? <EOS> we're gonna have a beep . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> twelve fifty . <EOS> um . <EOS> any guesses ? well <EOS> i suppose wi if the mar if our um if the i <EOS> if the young people are interested in l_c_d_ screens , we should make 'em . <EOS> and if that is our d uh market share to uh and our goal to uh deliver those uh remote controls <EOS>
since it's not feasible to add a cable to that . <EOS> this energy source of course is connected to the the user interface itself . <EOS> uh which can be buttons , whatever , <EOS> which in fact controls a chip . <EOS> right ? <EOS> this is the user interface <EOS> and there we have the chip . <EOS> um the way this goes normally is that this chip then controls an infrared lamp . <EOS> that sends out the signal . <EOS> of course the signal differs accordingly . um depending on what the chip tells the infrared lan lamp . <EOS> and of course that's controlled , the chip itself is controlled by the user interface . <EOS> the way you normally normally do it is that you add a little device such as a lamp to the whole thing as well , <EOS> so that you know that it's working basically . <EOS> you press something , you get a response . <EOS> which is also comparatively um important on one of those devices . <EOS> now this , <EOS> what we're talking about here , or what i think should be discussed are these two components mostly . <EOS> the the uh energy source for one thing can be altered . <EOS> what we probably cannot alter is of course the infrared , the sending device basically , the infrared lamp . <EOS> we cannot change the chip <EOS> which controls the infrared lamp . <EOS> right ? <EOS> these two are components that we have to use , <EOS> and these are dictated by the whole function of the whole thing . <EOS> um the lamp can be put onto the desi the device . <EOS> it c it doesn't have to be there . <EOS> this can be discussed as well . <EOS> the user interface . that's something we can also discuss . <EOS> um as we've heard uh speech recognition is the hype obviously in the moment . <EOS> speech recognition um interface , <EOS> we don't know that . <EOS> or if we just do the usual button thing . <EOS> or we have a touch pad or something like that <EOS> that's something we can discuss . <EOS> and of course the energy source . batteries . solar cells . <EOS> who knows ? <EOS>
and so i've written at written at the bottom to give us sort of a context of discussion , mac ipods , <EOS> something which is , i'd have to say very high-tech , ten gigabytes , whatever , <EOS> but when you hold it in your hand there's like no buttons . <EOS> you know what a mac ipod is ? <EOS>
um . <EOS> okay . <EOS> something by there . <EOS> oh is this k to get an idea of scale from your from your thing there okay . <EOS> so you can power on and off , <EOS> what else can you do ? <EOS> yeah , yeah . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> l_c_d_ on the remote just telling you what's on , or uh , interactive l_c_d_ or <EOS> i uh <EOS> well <EOS> literally um if you can imagine the display maybe slightly larger than um those on a a mobile phone , <EOS> something where you can read an an um fair amount of information , <EOS> traverse maybe quite a few menus , <EOS> if we maybe used mobile phones as a good example , <EOS> they usually incorporate they have the keypad , <EOS> and then evr all the other functionality is usually associated inside by traversing around . <EOS> that could be one possibility . <EOS> um and then we could have like say the common buttons as you say , volume control , changing channels <EOS>
yep . <EOS> and that's <EOS> yeah . <EOS> d you must have very long shirts . <EOS> that's way far down lapel mic . <EOS> mm-mm , lapel . <EOS> wha okay , oh , alright . <EOS> lapel lapel lapel . <EOS> that's almost a crotch mi cr <EOS>
because we are going to look at the finance <EOS> and i have a nice excel sheet to do that . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> redesign . no . <EOS> and um i'm not sure if i put it in the project folder . <EOS> look on that . <EOS> um and we're going to calculate the production costs , <EOS> and if they are uh under or at twelve euro fifty , <EOS>
it started because i wanted to have it as st as a stem <EOS> and then <EOS> alright , so <EOS> break the stem off . <EOS> oh <EOS> that's funny . <EOS> is it started as a pear , <EOS> but then it started looking more and more like a martian <EOS> when i put the <EOS>
but <EOS> it might be confusing . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> besides you like to be able to go power . <EOS> i have the power <EOS> i guess . <EOS> so we definitely want a power button and numbers . <EOS> right . <EOS> yeah , i never think to hold something down . <EOS>
alright . <EOS> um there was some research on new features in a remote control . <EOS> uh about an l_c_d_ screen uh and speech recognition . <EOS> well we got an update for the for the audience . or the the the targeted group . <EOS> so it's above forty i guess . <EOS>
huh . <EOS> you did ? <EOS> well <EOS> oh , right . <EOS> well <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> champagne . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , sure . <EOS> no prob . <EOS> oh thank you . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> do we get another email ? <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> anybody else have any other comments or any other things that we feel we should evaluate ? <EOS> uh . <EOS> here is what we looking at uh satisfaction on for example room for creativity . <EOS> um . <EOS> is there more room for creativity or are we absolutely happy ? <EOS>
international would make sense . <EOS> um you're gonna look at product evaluation . <EOS> i'm <EOS> i'd better start writing up a hell of a lot of crap . <EOS> um you're gonna look a bit more at the kind of the physical make up you say . <EOS> um looks like we're gonna need a maybe a kind of prototype in clay . <EOS> uh we'll see how that goes . um . <EOS>
some some efficient . <EOS> no no <EOS> we just um have some cooperation with some research institute , <EOS> we don't have to do some basic research on this field . <EOS> so <EOS> you think it won't cost an not a lot for us ? <EOS> or ? <EOS>
well okay , so <EOS> in terms of elegant , fancy . we'll call it e_f_ um , do we do we think that perhaps and maybe we should say the yellow ? <EOS> should we go with the yellow <EOS> in terms of <EOS> i think that's a really superior <EOS> they're both <EOS>
well hi everyone again . <EOS> hello . <EOS> hello . <EOS> hello <EOS> um <EOS> like before we uh i have to redo the meetings from n th the minutes from the last meeting <EOS> and so here we go . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> uh it was discussed in the last meeting uh which was opened by the presentation from the interface um <EOS>
yeah <EOS> bu but <EOS> i think they like the speech . <EOS> you could call to your uh <EOS> yeah , and the screen , <EOS> yeah . <EOS> l_c_d_ screen and scroll . <EOS> scroll options , yeah . <EOS> i i think they'll be quite met with their expectations . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> but this was first step and <EOS> this was the first step , yeah . <EOS> i think the solution is to have many colours of you know instead of having one grey standard yeah , <EOS> but i think it will increase the price of the production of the remote control . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> the other thing is , just ch chucking into mobile phone f design features again , it could have a flip top remote control <EOS> so that when you flip over the top , your screen is you can have a bigger screen in the the flip over . <EOS>
oh that's good , <EOS> no , that's nice and friendly . <EOS> mm-hmm . mm . <EOS> mm-hmm , <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> and then um uh for the for the led , for the light emitting diode it is a fluorescent green <EOS> and it's a a it is a bulb like an ordinary infrared . <EOS>
i thought <EOS> okay , <EOS> that will be great . <EOS> and uh i'll send you the the minutes of meet <EOS> you can object if you want to <EOS> no , <EOS> i i'm just thinking in terms of time , <EOS> like if <EOS> she's objecting . <EOS>
i've i've got some things to say about possible design things from trend watching . <EOS> yeah , maybe we should see yours first . <EOS> oh okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> cool . <EOS> right , um i've been looking at some trends in in sort of basically fashion on top of doing the um research into the remote control market <EOS> the the one that's the one i talked about last time , <EOS> that we'd sort of asked people about remote controls and what what was good about them , what was bad , what they used . <EOS> and we've also been looking at sort of fa sort of fashions and what people are wanting out of consumer goods at the moment . <EOS> so we've had people in paris and milan watching the uh fashion trends . <EOS> so <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> then uh we need plastic with some elasticity so that if your if the remote control falls it's not broken directly into pieces , <EOS> there should be some flexibility in t <EOS> i guess that fits in with the spongy kind of design philosophy . <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
there we go , there we go . <EOS> okay . <EOS> oh , that's strange . <EOS> oh , if you press if you press function and that again <EOS> there's there's usually three modes , one where it's only here , one where it's only there , and one where it's both . <EOS>
hmm . you're old-fashioned . <EOS> sorry . <EOS> so <EOS> these abilities are mainly ad addressed by young people ? <EOS> or it's <EOS> these i'm sorry . <EOS> this you you so did you <EOS> yeah , yeah <EOS> we have people uh uh listening to the trends everywhere in the world , of course , <EOS> as you know our company is quite big <EOS> and uh so i'm just asking them what are the current trends according to them when they go in the stores and when they ask uh their uh friends <EOS> that are also <EOS> well . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> wh <EOS> i i think it's easier sometimes to have them buy changeable covers for it than to buy a whole new one , <EOS> because you don't feel like you're investing in a whole new product . <EOS> w i mean we we can uh uh b but <EOS> i mean my feeling is that current power sources are such that for relatively little cost you can make it last , you know , a long time . <EOS> um but if we also make it cheap enough that people either change the cover every year or even buy a new one every year then it it's it's even better . <EOS>
they're act there <EOS> there was a remote control that came out two years ago that had a some basic speech recognition on it . <EOS> you could programme it with your channels and then you say you know like uh b_b_c_ one and it goes to that channel . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> it didn't work very well though because of this noise interference problem . <EOS> they mentioned you know if the television says you are listening to b_b_c_ one . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> i think i know what you might be getting at , or or <EOS> oh i see <EOS> so if maybe if we had an l_c_d_ up the top that just did a number on it , right ? <EOS> oh no <EOS> we could read it from the television . <EOS>
right . <EOS> and what we may be able to do , and i think this might be the best option is to combine some a couple of these . <EOS> um my recommendation personally would be to do some kind of a plastic inner shell with a like a rubber outer shell , <EOS> to make it um to mak uh like a thick plastic inner shell <EOS> and a t um kind of a to have that rubber outer shell to make it more durable , <EOS> and also maybe i i think it feels a little better than the plastic . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> really good . <EOS> so . <EOS> they like that spongy feel . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> it looks like it's going over well , so <EOS> and the paging function works well , <EOS> that's good to hear , <EOS> we worked hard on that one . <EOS>
oh no , <EOS> because if you if you add uh something <EOS> well yeah maybe <EOS> because it's three different pieces uh to to to build but <EOS> hmm . <EOS> but you can make it on a single p_c_ with three different options . <EOS> yeah yeah yeah <EOS> it's i think it's cheaper if you if you already built the all the functionalities um on the same module , but uh <EOS>
what's the blue part ? <EOS> oh that's the batteries . <EOS> okay . <EOS> that was just <EOS> we ran out of yellow . <EOS> there you go <EOS> . oops . <EOS> there you go . <EOS> even simpler . <EOS> looks more like a banana . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> for all those fruit lovers out there . <EOS>
yeah ? <EOS> okay . <EOS> open . <EOS> which one is it ? <EOS> smart board ? <EOS> okay . <EOS> and now ? <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay , <EOS> thanks . <EOS> 'kay , <EOS> i've speed up . <EOS> 'kay , that's fine . <EOS> line width . <EOS>
now it's gone again . <EOS> ah . <EOS> you know , <EOS> i think the the company's s next project should to design a better overhead device that switches immediately . <EOS> yes , <EOS> because i can't even see mine . <EOS> next meeting starts in thirty minutes , <EOS> these are the individual actions . <EOS> yeah , right . <EOS> um the look and feel design is for kate , <EOS> uh steph gets the user interface design , <EOS> you get product evaluation . <EOS> um the two of you get to play with a pla modelling clay um to do a prototype . <EOS> uh and everybody gets individual instructions in the usual way . <EOS> anything else we need to do ? <EOS>
that's awesome . <EOS> maybe i have a different one . <EOS> so <EOS> is that a close ? <EOS> yeah , <EOS> i guess we'll call that a a doner . <EOS> fab . <EOS> okay , <EOS> that's the end of the meeting . <EOS> thank you gentlemen . <EOS> i feel like i'm signing off . <EOS>
oh , <EOS> i didn't realise . <EOS> um yeah , <EOS> it's like a <EOS> i suppose it's kind of similar to a very very basic web browser . <EOS> um you have like you have uh numbers on your remote control , <EOS> uh y and you type in the page number you want , <EOS> so like you type a hundred on your remote control and <EOS> this this kind of index appears on the television screen with just some some text and some very blocky looking graphics on it . <EOS> and you just type numbers to go to different pages <EOS> and it gives you information , mostly rather boring stuff like what's on t_v_ next and share prices and that kind of thing . <EOS>
so it's anti-r_s_i_ . <EOS> it's yellow . <EOS> it is very bright , yeah . <EOS> i don't think it's gonna get lost easily . <EOS> no ? <EOS> but it is smallish . <EOS> it's not the kinda thing that's gonna slip like between a couch cushion or something , you know . <EOS>
but i mean we can put an additional mute button on the top as well . <EOS> if you <EOS> yeah , <EOS> i mean that wouldn't actually cost any more . <EOS> that's the spin wheel though , isn't it ? <EOS> didn't that come with the l_c_ <EOS> that's with the l_c_ <EOS>
oh okay <EOS> phew . <EOS> i think you gotta g get into cost effectiveness . <EOS> i think if you can have the base station with a with a locator , i think those are two very strong features , <EOS> if that's something that can be integrated without a bunch of extra cost . <EOS>
yeah , <EOS> w <EOS> it is , yeah . <EOS> don't blame them . <EOS> um because of the way that we've minimalised the number of buttons and such . <EOS> plastic , it sucks . <EOS> but it's no worse than any of the other pl remote controls we have . <EOS>
true . <EOS> but why why do we need uh the flipping uh <EOS> you can adjust the angle to which it flips . <EOS> so it can also from this angle , it can flip all the way up to there . <EOS> you can flip it up to there if you want . <EOS>
apple for channel one . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> to to the trend <EOS> but <EOS> so something that looks half like a fruit and half like an elephant . <EOS> for instance , yeah . <EOS> african or as an elephant ? <EOS> that we can discuss afterwards . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> next . <EOS> um . <EOS> so y you are the secretary also . <EOS> right ? <EOS> okay . <EOS> yes . indeed . <EOS> um . then i hope you all have uh worked out some some uh some some presentations about uh about well you the the task given to you in the previous meeting . <EOS> um . w we will uh in a minute we will uh start with them . <EOS> um , we will see in which order we will handle them of . <EOS> um then i will uh bring in some some some new requirements <EOS> i i got uh from the uh account manager , <EOS> i try to work them out , <EOS> they were quite abstract , <EOS> and we can have maybe have com some discussion about it . uh um about the functions <EOS> and <EOS> well <EOS> in this meeting we should really try to reach a decision about the target group
if you right click on it you can <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> we've got <EOS> um we're planning to sell these remote controls for <EOS> let's make that go away , <EOS> that means we've got five minutes . <EOS> um we're planning to sell the remote controls for twenty five euros each . <EOS> um and with that we're aiming for a profit of fifty million euros . <EOS> and that's selling them on the international market , not just in the u_k_ . <EOS> um so to do that our finance people estimate that we need production costs of maximum twelve and a half euro so that we can reach that profit target . <EOS> so that's something to keep in mind while you're designing . <EOS> okay . <EOS> hmm . <EOS>
um and also , as opposed to last year , this year the material is expected to be spongy in feel . <EOS> okay so from that um , as we've already said , we need to focus on a fancy look-and-feel . <EOS> um i think we've already discovered that it's kind of hard to go away from the traditional rectangular design . <EOS> but i think that , even if it's very subtle , we need to kind of trick our consumers , <EOS> so they at least get the idea that they're getting something that's new and modern and sleek and <EOS> whether it's through the shape or the colours or all of that . <EOS> um for technologically innovative , we've talked about the tracking device . <EOS> we brought up the idea of having two pieces , which we could discuss further . <EOS> and manuel had suggested um the energy source and the user interface , discussing some of those , um that we could change a little bit . <EOS> we need to keep it simple , have limited buttons , <EOS> which i think the two piece idea might be really beneficial for . <EOS> um we need to incorporate this fashion trend of fruits and vegetables . <EOS> i don't know , <EOS> i mean i guess the two options are if we had our remote in the shape of a fruit or vegetable . <EOS> yeah . yeah . right . <EOS> or with exterior designs . <EOS> but my question is , i mean the stereotypically speaking , you kind of picture males with their remote controls , <EOS> and i'm not sure how they'd feel about having fruity logos on the outside . <EOS> so maybe we could have something that's somewhat removable , <EOS> or i don't know , different options for female , male target groups . <EOS>
if you make something that looks like a banana it should have the colour of a banana . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> no , i i <EOS> a yeah , otherwise it'll be mis means you don't get b any feeling then . <EOS> it's neither a banana nor a <EOS>
yeah , mm . <EOS> i think 'cause the meetings were so regular , you know . <EOS> it wasn't like we were alone for very long , <EOS> so you didn't st go off and think , wouldn't it be great to have a vibrating remote control shaped like a banana , <EOS> and then , you know , come back three days later and jen's going look , look , it vibrates and it looks like a banana . <EOS> um yeah , so yeah . <EOS>
participant two . <EOS> yeah , participant two . <EOS> component . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yep . <EOS> so <EOS> we're to mainly design f mainly need to know which components we'll use for energy , and the material and interface . <EOS> for energy there are maybe two or three possibilities . <EOS> first one , we can use simple battery , <EOS> or we can use traditional solar cells <EOS> or <EOS> mm and the material we can have plastic , <EOS> rubber which is good for this r_s_a_ <EOS> and then uh titanium , which can be which have very good look <EOS> an and then interface we're to use push buttons or liquid crystal d l_c_d_ display . <EOS> and we can use some , moving kind of thing . <EOS>
well <EOS> colour , i think i definitely have a preference towards bright yellow with black buttons , <EOS> because that's the company colours , <EOS> but if anybody's got any other suggestions , i'm quite willing to consider them as well . <EOS> um the the case <EOS> oops , <EOS> that's the uh on off button just come off our prototype . <EOS> the the case can be either um spongy rubber or hard plastic . <EOS> we're not absolutely sure about a combination of the two , <EOS> but it can be either of those . <EOS> we have the technology to do that . <EOS> um and as for the the actual components um , uh steph just said this is a quite a cheap device to manufacture . <EOS> we have simple rubber push buttons <EOS> um which provide all the functionality we need . <EOS> um the um the diode that actually does the um infrared is at the end , <EOS> it's the stalk of the banana , <EOS> or it's just the thing at the end of this version . <EOS> um so <EOS> that's for material . <EOS>
well uh <EOS> chip on print , i think what they mean uh with the regular rubber buttons that you got , uh it's always clear for the remote control when you press uh a certain button . <EOS> but when you got a l_c_d_ screen , with no uh with not the buttons are not always on the same place , <EOS> for example if you enlarge a button , or if you got several options uh appearing on your screen , uh the co-ordinations aren't always the same . <EOS> when you got a regular button , th the button of stand-by is always on the same place <EOS> and you got on the and on the <EOS>
yeah <EOS> or yeah a limit uh maybe even just a limited multi-colour so it it doesn't look too childish , perhaps . <EOS> makes it easy to use . <EOS> yeah , that's true , <EOS> because that blue one did look quite hardish . <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> although i mean this uh uh also comes to shape as well . <EOS> i mean if we are gonna make it a novel <EOS> i mean double-curved sounds good to me if we're talking about sorta ergonomic and easy use , <EOS>
sorry about the uh lack of information on cost , <EOS> i just haven't been provided that information by our manufacturers <EOS> and i'm just having to guess . <EOS> okay . <EOS> we'll have more of an idea when the prototype have more of a we'll have more of an idea later on . <EOS> um . and we just yeah go from there . <EOS>
production department to to make a a real prototype that we can use at home to to evaluate . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> okay so thanks very much . <EOS> bye . <EOS> yep . <EOS> okay . <EOS> thank you . <EOS> thank you . <EOS> bye . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> user-friendly design . mm . <EOS> uh any comments like , if you want ? 'kay . <EOS> um , i think we'll chat about it at the end , <EOS> okay so if anyone wants to write something down that they want to bring up at the end , um <EOS>
channel five . and then it switches on . <EOS> no , <EOS> tha that w that w that would be more promising . <EOS> it it's just a remote that talks to you . <EOS> uh . i mean to certain cues . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
it'll be again in the marketing . <EOS> i thought the light from the inside was gonna light up . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> the light it will . <EOS> or or was it gonna make a noise ? <EOS> but <EOS> yeah . <EOS> but when the alarm's not <EOS> yeah <EOS> . if you <EOS>
mm . <EOS> 'kay . <EOS> so what do we think maybe we should <EOS> pedro , do you have any opinion on it ? <EOS> uh we should keep it simple , mm medium-low cost mar um cost area and uh make it look good . <EOS> w a question i have in in a <EOS> 'cause i i i think i agree with you on , we gotta make it a box . <EOS> the box is gonna sell it i think , the outside , the casing . <EOS> can can can we have multiple designs ? <EOS>
yeah . yeah . <EOS> yes . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> that's a super idea . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> um the third thing was that we have to make sure the corporate image is very much incorporated into the handset . <EOS> um so we want logo , <EOS> we want um fashionable , trendy , <EOS> i mean what you were talking about with the marketing . um , people paying more for it to look good . <EOS> um , we need to focus on that as well . <EOS>
i think it could probably be aimed at most people who've used a mobile . <EOS> and that might be just another way of saying try to target most people . <EOS> um , if we are if we were to follow that avenue , we might be s you know um we're kind of almost relying on their experience with a mobile phone i suppose . <EOS> but that does cover a very large section of the people out there . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , some <EOS> yeah . <EOS> something like a plastic cover covering uh some interface , u_s_b_ interface as in the in uh digital camera . <EOS> if you see it's like peeling . you open a plastic cover and you see some u_s_b_ interfaces , some some interfaces for adaptor . <EOS> so keys can be uh buttons can be covered like this , with a plastic cover <EOS> and uh when uh and when you open this cover it's like peeling a banana . <EOS> so , something like this . <EOS>
with menus , yeah , yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> what about the older generation ? <EOS> what about granny and grandads ? <EOS> you mean to save it lesser number . <EOS> um , my grandad can answer his mobile phone , <EOS> but he couldn't even dream of texting or something like that . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> mm , right . <EOS> uh touch screen interface , um possibly having go-to buttons being uh stuck into the system <EOS> so those don't move away from the screen , uh , the important ones like power , volume and jump between channels . <EOS> um , and of course our voice command system which i've talked a little bit about already <EOS> and uh the use of recognisable colours and shapes to aid recognition of the features um that are around <EOS> so <EOS>
so <EOS> get your mouse . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> and to put uh the the buttons for um changing uh the channel uh over here uh <EOS> yeah . that's a good one . <EOS> but i think it's better to put the screen uh on top . <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
and i'll see if i can argue with boss about putting the <EOS> what was it ? <EOS> we put we put fashion into <EOS> whoops , <EOS> it's not working . <EOS> oh yeah , that's a good one that . <EOS> yeah so . <EOS> can't believe i've forgotten it . <EOS> we put the fashion in electronics <EOS> . i bet that'll catch on well . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> they should be remote . <EOS> okay , it it works like this . <EOS> uh , that's better . <EOS> okay , thanks . <EOS> your lapel microphone's fallen off . <EOS> are you left-handed ? <EOS> oh , pity . <EOS> no . <EOS> okay . <EOS> should i clean ? <EOS>
so try and get t_v_ manufacturers to <EOS> yeah . <EOS> no , <EOS> it's okay , yeah i understand . <EOS> so we need some numbering buttons , some teletext things <EOS> and then um <EOS> yeah . <EOS> the <EOS> yeah , <EOS> the main is browsing . yeah . <EOS>
three . <EOS> so criteria three is is it easy to use ? <EOS> i think it's a one , i think . <EOS> easy to use . <EOS> i'd say it's i wouldn't <EOS> not if you're left-handed it's not . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i would give it a i would give it a two , <EOS> 'cause i i it i it i it is more geared for right-handed people than left-handed people , but <EOS>
i you can if you like , <EOS> it it that that just sets it up to do a p a p <EOS> no <EOS> that one , that one there . <EOS> there we are . yay . <EOS> that ? <EOS> that ? <EOS> left , left a bit , left a bit , <EOS> that one , yep . <EOS> and then you just press the click when you wanna go on .
yeah . <EOS> um i agree with his point <EOS> it's um it is quite a lot of fun t to go and then you have sort of hit the end then go right , gotta cut everything out 'cause we don't have enough money . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yellow . <EOS> yellow , i like that idea . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> oh , that one . <EOS> i like the yellow illumination idea , very good . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> any other ideas or thoughts ? <EOS> we all seem to be fairly in agreement about what we wanna do with this project so <EOS>
okay . <EOS> s so you're simply <EOS> you're simply looking s to a remote control that looks like a banana with few buttons with only a few buttons . <EOS> more things . <EOS> it's not so simple . <EOS> for instance , yeah . <EOS> yeah for for for given an an example yeah . <EOS>
'kay . <EOS> i suggest um the single curved , <EOS> because maybe the curve is pretty good to put the the screen in . <EOS> uh so that elderly people can uh use the remote control <EOS> and at the same time look easily at the screen , <EOS> because it's a bit , it has a bit of a angle . <EOS>
on the content . <EOS> mm-hmm , yeah . <EOS> yeah , yeah it's it's a good idea it's a good idea <EOS> but i i think that technically it would be um a little bit uh uh more tricky to to achieve this than just to <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> maybe with our little robot one we could've had him have a robot , alien , pear , whatever he is , have a little voice like , i am located <EOS> oh <EOS> a g_p_s_ system , internal g_p_s_ . <EOS> oh man . <EOS> here you go . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . uh , <EOS> i think the idea uh about uh touch screen um is very good . <EOS> um , because recently uh i saw news item on t_v_ um about uh new telephones uh for elder people . <EOS> um , they have like a touch screen with uh really big pictures on it like uh uh call uh hang-up , <EOS> um and that's a big ad advantage i think , <EOS> because one the one hand uh you make the remote control compatible for elder users just by uh scaling up the pictures or something . <EOS> it's uh <EOS>
like modified banana , okay . <EOS> well it we'll stick to banana , or ? <EOS> so we are agree with the banana thing ? <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah , banana's good . <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> mm-mm . <EOS> so , the last point we decided it's infra-red , i guess . <EOS> everybody's agreed . <EOS>
yeah , <EOS> where are going to <EOS> where are you are you going to place them ? <EOS> mm-hmm mm-hmm . <EOS> it'll it'll be always at top somewhere at there . <EOS> if i was gonna place them i'd put them on the on the top here since that's like uh the black bit <EOS> but yeah i don't i really don't think it's necessary to have the solar cells anymore . <EOS>
being manipulated by the joystick , yeah . <EOS> oh , and joystick , <EOS> yeah . <EOS> which i'm defining as scroll wheel . um . <EOS> and we couldn't replace the joystick , <EOS> right ? <EOS> because we would need four extra buttons to replace it , up down left and right , <EOS> and that would be more expensive <EOS> than a <EOS> but is a scroll wheel not just back and forward ? <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> so <EOS> p <EOS> as um anna has said that this ki people are interested in things which are you don't need to k press the keys , <EOS> people are can have a speech recognition <EOS> but this is uh s a question which will we have to see later . <EOS> but in the present scenario is that you have certain keys <EOS> and you press it like your mobile phone , <EOS> and it sends a message to the t_v_ . <EOS> and um so generally mm <EOS> i don't have some figures <EOS> sorry <EOS> but um so <EOS> there are two kinds of uh remote if you popularly in the household , <EOS> actually so <EOS> you have a standard t_v_ remote <EOS> where you have just a on , off button and play , uh volume change and uh keys for the number and more than one digit option . <EOS>
uh <EOS> yeah <EOS> w i i think they they say that it's uh difficult to learn how to use it but i when you know how to use it , it's it's okay . <EOS> but <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> and <EOS> okay . <EOS> it's not intuitive first . <EOS>
yeah <EOS> i think you're going to s you're going to use it with one thumb . <EOS> yeah <EOS> but i think <EOS> yeah <EOS> i don't know . <EOS> perhaps i have some examples . <EOS> i don't know <EOS> w <EOS> we'll leave that to the usability engineering then . <EOS>
it's kinda like a peacock . <EOS> yeah , it kinda was actually , <EOS> 'cause it was <EOS> this part of the body was really dull , and then it was the most colourful exotic butterfly ever , <EOS> and i'm like , wow this is the middle of scotland in like march . <EOS> so i thought that was pretty cool . <EOS> and it landed by a wall and let me look at it for about two minutes . <EOS> i wish i'd had my camera . <EOS> so that's gonna be my favourite animal because after all the snow it seemed to say that like spring is finally here . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> there you go . <EOS>
yeah . yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> ninety . twenty five . <EOS> you can clap or something . <EOS> yeah yeah . <EOS> channel . <EOS> turn volume up . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> hey , <EOS> that <EOS> that's an idea . <EOS> now you shouldn't say the wrong thing , i dunno . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> but when all the questions i had <EOS> do we want to use uh a menu display on the t_v_ ? <EOS> or um does have to f everything uh be in remotes ? <EOS> 'cause if you use a memory display on the t_v_ , you can simply push uh a more menu and then select the options you want to have and press okay . <EOS> uh so <EOS> that's my recommendation , <EOS> if you use many options in one buttle button , um display the menu on the t_v_ <EOS> and don't um use combination of t of two buttons at the same time or pressing buttons three times for five seconds , <EOS> is too complicated for most users . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> i thought that was good though , <EOS> because if you're given too much time then you got nothing to do with your time and um yeah . <EOS> although we could have made the r_s better had we had five more minute . <EOS> yeah , yeah , yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
um we are <EOS> so the meeting will have about the same format as the last time . <EOS> so switching over i've just left uh my first two screens . <EOS> um <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> i have mailed you the minutes of the last meeting uh just to save time . <EOS> um and is there any questions you have that arised from last meeting that <EOS>
t <EOS> mm . <EOS> alright . <EOS> great . <EOS> okay . <EOS> and project manager will design a better meeting for next time around , <EOS> be a little bit more prepared . <EOS> and uh alright , <EOS> good meeting . <EOS>
um , do you wanna answer this one <EOS> or do you want me to answer it ? <EOS> do we know where we stand on that yet ? <EOS> well <EOS> we didn't quite have enough material uh . <EOS> oh <EOS> i wasn't expecting a prototype <EOS> i just didn't know if you guys had any in mind yet . <EOS>
yeah you're right , you have to <EOS> so <EOS> you say s <EOS> spongy . <EOS> s <EOS> do we agree on that ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> we have to . <EOS> so , <EOS> do you think <EOS> no , we don't have to , <EOS> but seems it's the trend . <EOS> again , as i said we can also try to make it , to create the trend . <EOS> so there's no <EOS>
okay , i'll get back to you on that . <EOS> yes . <EOS> thank you . <EOS> okay . <EOS> and uh ed uh so what's what do you think about uh this uh project for the remote control <EOS> and d do you have some already planned something for your marketing strategy or uh the sales strategy ? <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> whatever . yeah . <EOS> mm . <EOS> think it was also realisation of you basically just copy and paste what's given to you into your presentation <EOS> which uh wasn't so clear to me at the beginning . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> very much , yeah . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> je croix que c'est dommage de le <EOS> it will be sad to destroy this prototype . <EOS> it really looks like a banana . <EOS> it is a banana . <EOS> it is a banana . <EOS> it is the essence of bananas . <EOS> i would be confused with this thing . <EOS>
yeah rechargeable batteries . <EOS> we have the charger so it's no problem . <EOS> yeah and you just <EOS> so one one battery ? <EOS> on uh yeah one battery . <EOS> is that two or one ? <EOS> it's kinetic reserve . <EOS> actually uh it's a flexible thing . <EOS> you just n uh <EOS>
wood wood would ge would give us a little bit of a marketing niche , wouldn't it . <EOS> i think wood i <EOS> i i can't see anybody wanting to use a wooden remote , <EOS> it's just anti-technology really , you know . <EOS> it it it <EOS> nah . <EOS>
yes . <EOS> the marketing choices , <EOS> you know , like <EOS> that was a bit of a conflict . <EOS> i will <EOS> i just feel like if you're really doing like a a really big market evaluation , you wouldn't just have like one set of source , <EOS> it's kind of an <EOS> they were so not backed up , <EOS> it would just be a sentence like we did a survey , this is what people said . <EOS>
uh i <EOS> yeah , that's true . <EOS> but <EOS> no , <EOS> but i think there are multiple colour leds . <EOS> so <EOS> is it <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> but can you change it if you already bought the the remote control ? <EOS> you <EOS>
that's the brilliance of they had a p they had a peeler in here . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> i think , yeah re i thought it was like really creative actually , i mean . <EOS> i think the teamwork was good as well . <EOS> mm yeah , <EOS> i'm impressed . <EOS>
l keep it clean , keep it clean . <EOS> really different colours basically . <EOS> okay , sor i sorry , i used the wrong word , <EOS> what do you associate with the mate the material that material ? <EOS> um <EOS> um like i'm just thinking bright colours . <EOS>
well so the l_c_d_ display is is three francs , sorry three euros , by itself . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> and uh we don't want to to change that <EOS> right ? <EOS> we we really want a l_c_d_ <EOS> other otherwise we w wouldn not get the market . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> where is that ? <EOS> yours is <EOS> under the shared folder , <EOS> i don't know it might not even be under yours as well . <EOS> projects . <EOS> technical . <EOS> so <EOS> in there we have technical functions presentation , working design presentation and the functional requirements . <EOS> at least that's what i have in . <EOS>
now , we're developing a remote control which you probably already know . <EOS> um , we want it to be original , <EOS> something that's uh people haven't thought of , <EOS> that's not out in the shops , <EOS> um , trendy , <EOS> appealing to a wide market , <EOS> but you know , not a hunk of metal , <EOS> and user-friendly , <EOS> grannies to kids , maybe even pooches should be able to use it . <EOS> okay , um , first is the functional design , <EOS> um this is where we all go off and do our individual work , <EOS> um what needs need to be fulfilled by the product , <EOS> um what effects the product has to have <EOS> and how it's actually going to do that . <EOS> um , conceptual design , <EOS> what we're thinking , <EOS> how it's gonna go <EOS> and then the detailed design , <EOS> how we're actually gonna put it into practice and make it work . <EOS>
wait , <EOS> is it like the weather channel where it's got like the ticker running on the bottom or something ? <EOS> kind of . <EOS> except the entire screen . <EOS> it's the entire screen is just running information at random . <EOS> seemingly . <EOS> yeah it's the whole screen . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> we're saying per unit . <EOS> per unit , okay , okay . <EOS> yeah , per unit . <EOS> okay , <EOS> so each unit will only have one colour on their <EOS> but the case is <EOS> alright , <EOS> and each button s <EOS> could have up to thr <EOS> i mean the buttons could ea could be up to three colours , <EOS> 'cause that how it's designed there . <EOS> so <EOS>
nee that's that's <EOS> uh yeah . <EOS> but then you can't <EOS> and go to standby mode when you don't use it , <EOS> so that <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah yeah <EOS> au <EOS> automac matically , <EOS> that it yeah . <EOS> yeah , automatically . <EOS> after two minutes or three minutes , something like that . <EOS>
okay . uh <EOS> little uh little kinda exercise to uh know each other . <EOS> at uh the white board on the left . every uh every one of us uh must draw our favourite animal , <EOS> and uh tell uh tell us why we uh had uh chosen that animal . <EOS>
show to the management . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> shall we uh make a new uh <EOS> i would yeah . <EOS> yeah <EOS> l let's just uh delete all these uh or <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> next . <EOS> . <EOS> yeah , i just make a new one . <EOS> alright . <EOS>
okay , <EOS> but th that becomes your f uh uh <EOS> because that's very hard for uh speech recognition . <EOS> well <EOS> i dunno . <EOS> but i don't think , it just ain't useful enough . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> so <EOS> we have to make some decisions . <EOS> so <EOS> you can see on the uh <EOS> so <EOS> we have to know what we're going to put on . <EOS> do we , do we make uh a light under the under the n under the numbers and everything ? <EOS> do <EOS> if you press something , it lights up for a few seconds , <EOS> so you can see what other but buttons there are , <EOS> okay ? <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> so some <EOS> well or yeah or if it's really , if it's really in a dark spot that it gives out a a sound or a signal . <EOS> yeah . mm-hmm . <EOS> so if lost <EOS> yeah , some beep or something like that , <EOS> so that we can go <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> but do we still need a two level remote control ? <EOS> because if we only have that l only f <EOS> no . <EOS> it's only for television now . <EOS> so i i don't think so . <EOS> uh i just thought of another one . <EOS> most things in modern t_v_s are also on the menu . <EOS> so you also need a menu button . <EOS> and then uh navigation uh <EOS>
i think yeah , i think a scroll wheel would be nice , <EOS> but it's not necessary . um <EOS> right . <EOS> so we could either go with a simple or a regular chip , depending <EOS> and maybe we could table that decision for later . <EOS> um . <EOS>
mm ? <EOS> of the tested people say that's it's quite difficult to to to use the remote control . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> do they say that this is difficult but for the same reason or do they have other reason ? <EOS> oh . <EOS> would j <EOS> to to <EOS> maybe to keep in mind maybe to access to that menu you should do something like that . <EOS>
okay <EOS> so it d it doesn't says uh to uh have the slogan ? <EOS> it must be recognisable . <EOS> okay okay . <EOS> well <EOS> that's possible of course . <EOS> we could make a little r_ and r_ on the top of the machine . <EOS> uh so <EOS> they are pretty boring , <EOS> i suggest , because just the availability with rubber to make fantastic colours uh and also in a lot of possible colours , so it's possible to make very uh fancy uh remote controls <EOS> which peopl uh who people <EOS>
right . <EOS> is tricky . <EOS> or rubber <EOS> and um and titanium also seems to be tricky when it comes to the form . <EOS> so the way to go is if you want a scroll wheel you either make it flat and angular , uh add an l_c_d_ screen , and um then you can basically choose either plastic or titanium . <EOS> or wood even . <EOS> um if you wanna make it a particular shape , use plastic . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> okay . <EOS> and you can get that information ? <EOS> i think i can get that information , yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> that would be very handy . <EOS> um but have you any idea so far as what uh the user requirements are ? <EOS>
okay . <EOS> sorry . <EOS> be careful . <EOS> damn . <EOS> yes . <EOS> success ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> no . come up . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> okay . <EOS> will you buy one ? <EOS> yeah . yeah i will try i'll try <EOS> . i can hel i will try versions so to see how easy easy to manage <EOS> try to . okay uh <EOS> twenty five euro . <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah you told me you h you d you d you lost your control your t_v_ <EOS> so so you need to buy one . <EOS>
i i think we should <EOS> it's four if you wanna do that . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah ? <EOS> it adds to sixteen , so that's four . <EOS> oh no . it adds to thirteen . one five five two . <EOS> oh i thought she said five . <EOS>
yes . <EOS> ah , okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> excellent . <EOS> except we can't <EOS> uh we can if we <EOS> then yeah , i'll take a note , it's fine . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> but that's alright . <EOS> if you take a note of them , <EOS> and then i'll put them in in a minute . <EOS> okay , so we're all agreeing on seven for a_ ? <EOS> cool , okay . <EOS> does it match the operating behaviour of the user ? <EOS>
oh yes . <EOS> mm . <EOS> great . <EOS> sounds good . <EOS> i don't think so . <EOS> go to it . <EOS> play-doh . <EOS> and that's the end of this meeting . <EOS> that's for her benefit . <EOS> that's really all i got , guys . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah this this is not unaffordable , <EOS> but the problem is whether people need it , whether they do have a t_v_ to use its full <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> i d i don't know many people without a t_v_ . <EOS> we didn't have a t_v_ last year , <EOS> and everyone thought we were off our heads , you know . <EOS>
so this is the technical functions design . <EOS> um <EOS> right <EOS> to do the um the design i have i've had a look online , i've had a look at the homepage , <EOS> which has given us um some insp inspiration from previous products . <EOS> um i've had a look at the previous products to see what they offer <EOS> and um i would like to ask you guys for um your ideas about the design at the end of the meeting . <EOS> um unfortunately we're not allowed to talk outside the meeting room , so <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> if if you you you can if you want you can use th the . <EOS> please , norman , draw uh <EOS> oh , i'm afraid you forgot to put your lapel . <EOS> mm . <EOS> where is it ? <EOS> the lapel . <EOS> or before the before the the design that says . <EOS>
'cause um it could <EOS> yeah . <EOS> especially with yellow . <EOS> mm . i dunno . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> 'cause i mean like uh if we <EOS> i mean how good is the speech recognition thing ? <EOS> do we want to go for buttons at all , <EOS> do we want to just have a device that maybe sits and pretends it's a fruit ? <EOS>
oh really ? <EOS> that's <EOS> oh . <EOS> seems to be quite complex . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> but then w <EOS> yeah , <EOS> we have to take care of the twelve euros <EOS> comple <EOS> no , it's not so complex . <EOS> problem . <EOS> and what about voice recognition , do we have microphones ? <EOS> and where will be they ? <EOS> do you think if we're far from television it will work ? <EOS>
okay , <EOS> welcome everyone to our next meeting . <EOS> i'm busy writing <EOS> and busy leading the meeting , <EOS> but um i've prepared a little presentation once again um or at least an agenda <EOS> i think uh the biggest part of the presentation will be uh on your side . <EOS> um we are here at the conceptual design meeting , which is hereby opened . <EOS> um once again i will try to uh write some minutes <EOS> which i just from the previous meeting uh placed inside our project folder , <EOS> which was quite some typing . <EOS> um today we once again have uh three presentations , if i'm right , <EOS> and after that we will take a decision on the remote control concepts . <EOS> and just as the last time we have forty minutes to accomplish that . <EOS> okay , well <EOS>
yes we can try that . <EOS> okay . <EOS>
uh i have a presentation <EOS> i just saved it in the uh the folder . <EOS> yeah , okay <EOS> well <EOS> i'll just uh i'll load it up then . um . <EOS> which one do y <EOS> uh . <EOS> oh , <EOS> interface concept ? <EOS> that's you . <EOS> we've got trend watching , <EOS> that's you . <EOS>
yeah . yeah , but that <EOS> it's now half past four half past three , <EOS> so <EOS> yeah , <EOS> but it's just the the off hours between that you will work alone . <EOS> yeah , okay . yeah , okay . <EOS> then it pops up pop up screen came . <EOS> five minutes in the meeting . <EOS> no . <EOS>
hmm . <EOS> always gets lost . <EOS> some sort of like device to help you find it . <EOS> i've used , i've used remote controls , for things like t_v_ and the c_d_ player and video recorder <EOS> and i i guess they're they're pretty neat neat little tools uh . <EOS> you don't have to get up <EOS> and walk across the room to change a channel . <EOS> so especially if you're someone really lazy like me they they're pretty nice . um . <EOS>
my laptop is crashing . <EOS> damn computers . <EOS> cr <EOS> help help help . <EOS> let's just check one more time . <EOS> mm . <EOS> can you hear me ? hello ? <EOS> test . <EOS> i dunno . <EOS> uh actually my laptop doesn't work , <EOS> switch it on again . <EOS>
where ? <EOS> oh . oh , <EOS> okay , mm-hmm . <EOS> it's not from <EOS> mm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> it's more general trend <EOS> it's not particular to the remote control . <EOS> no , it's not it's not <EOS> this this is very general , yeah . <EOS> but it seems that trends travel across things . <EOS> the what we <EOS>
havin having a water-proof remote control so that the people can uh use it in their bath . <EOS> mm . <EOS> that could be uh <EOS> b it seems uh so , <EOS> but uh if you don't have an waterproof remote control it means you can just cover it with some plastic and you can sort of f <EOS>
okay . so um <EOS> we're actually that sounds like a rough idea . <EOS> so <EOS> i should just look at um the speaker , the speaker and an l_e_d_ . <EOS> and <EOS> speaker and l_e_d_ for locating , um , <EOS> yeah , <EOS> and a transmitter . <EOS>
yeah ? <EOS> i mean i gue yeah , it's personal taste , <EOS> but <EOS> i would definitely go for that rather than like your average plain old remote like that , <EOS> but definitely in another colour , <EOS> i'm not happy with those colours . <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
yeah but mo most of the t_v_s nowadays show the show the <EOS> they have tele teletext . <EOS> well , because they have teletext on it . <EOS> th th you have a teletext sin signal that you can that you can uh that you can get thr through the channel . <EOS>
thin <EOS> no , actually . <EOS> that would be useful , though , <EOS> wouldn't it , <EOS> if you knew like what your money would get you now . <EOS> other <EOS> yeah . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah , interesting thing about discussing um production of a remote control for me is that l <EOS> as you point out , <EOS> i just don't think of remote controls as somethin something people consciously assess in their purchasing habits . <EOS> it's just like getting shoelaces with shoes or something . <EOS> it just comes along . <EOS>
yeah it works , yeah . <EOS> two . <EOS> two's not very high at all though . <EOS> maybe a bit higher ? <EOS> this is about this is about two . <EOS> slightly more than two , so <EOS> yeah . <EOS> see , about that thick . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> h here is just the the the module for the kids <EOS> and th if the parents want to watch t_v_ , up they come up with their modules , <EOS> they just plug in it <EOS> and they can have all the control they want here . <EOS> we also have this module for uh old people with big buttons , clearly labelled , <EOS> and it acts like the previous one , <EOS> you just plug in and it works . <EOS>
uh easy . <EOS> so <EOS> can someone make a a calculation about how many we have to sell of these to make fifty million , <EOS> i dunno . <EOS> uh so <EOS> we're gonna have a little discussion about um what experience are with a remote control the and everything , <EOS> so just have a look how it we think about remote controls . <EOS>
hmm . <EOS> so you finding , <EOS> just to say that the chip can detect uh when a key is pressed , <EOS> and then it translate to the key , to a sequence , something like morse code , as you know , uh with a different sequence for each key , <EOS> and uh uh <EOS> that's , <EOS> with the components we will use , we will have different uh messages , different sequences , <EOS> and the chips sends that signal signal to the transistor <EOS> that amplify to make it stronger <EOS> um .
mm . <EOS> mm-hmm , mm-hmm . <EOS> but um , <EOS> i've also included this turbo button <EOS> because i think , you know , every design should have a turbo button , <EOS> and well <EOS> so this is you know , a unique problem with with televisions is that if you have this scro this scroll wheel for the television , the uh the tuner on the t_v_ is not gonna be able to to switch between stations as fast as you can scroll , <EOS> so you know , the th the person might want to have a uh <EOS>
okay , <EOS> so how um <EOS> sorry , <EOS> can you uh just put that one back up again , please ? um . <EOS> mm . oh yep , <EOS> sorry . <EOS> yep . <EOS> uh d d d <EOS> okay , i mean uh <EOS> inevitably a b a custom design chip is gonna be more expensive . <EOS> do we do we know uh by how much ? <EOS>
true . it uh c it can go open . <EOS> well yeah the the idea of it was , is that because you close it , you cover the l_c_d_ screen and it won't be vulnerable to scratches or whatever . <EOS> if you cover it with rubber . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> hmm hmm yeah . <EOS> yeah , finance . <EOS> so we're bacal basically just lucky to uh get the price right . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> but the teamwork was okay . <EOS> yeah , uh everybody could speak their uh opinion . <EOS> and uh <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> okay . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> uh-huh , uh-huh . <EOS> could we integrate something into our remote control , something like light ? <EOS> seems important . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> that they can use it in darkness , like . mm glow in the dark , <EOS> so <EOS>
ts <EOS> so they do need to be in the <EOS> yeah they do need to be on the on the remote control . <EOS> i mean if you can't control the the sound settings i mean if you dislike a very uh loud bass or something , you you need to change that . <EOS> so um yeah we have to . <EOS> we c we c <EOS>
um <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i'd ignore that . <EOS> leave it blank . <EOS> okay . <EOS> we're gonna leave that one blank because we run on a l_c_d_ and scroll . <EOS> so our total is fifteen point five . <EOS> which i believe is <EOS> yeah that's too much . <EOS>
s maybe we can change from th <EOS> four . maybe four , it's okay . <EOS> i'll put four . <EOS> four . okay . <EOS> four ? <EOS> easy to use , four . <EOS> gonna say four . <EOS> four . <EOS> uh it's even easier to maybe . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> i'll go with two . <EOS> so what about you , brian ? <EOS> um yeah , <EOS> a three . <EOS> pretty much kept to the company strategy , so i would go for a a one , as we not only kept it , but we were limited by <EOS>
mm . <EOS> easily put us one step ahead of the current competition . <EOS> um what so wh what's in in what particular style features are you thinking about ? <EOS> um . something that looks looks doesn't look like remote control . <EOS> so if you want , something that looks like uh something that makes you think oh what's this ? <EOS> like this pen doesn't really look like a pen , <EOS> but it makes you think oh . <EOS> so , <EOS> sorry <EOS> that's a bit vague . <EOS>
you're just gonna believe me , <EOS> we'll go from there . <EOS> fair enough . <EOS> exactly . <EOS> um i mean <EOS> obvi if if you guys if if at the same time if you like logically if something doesn't like if i'm <EOS> like <EOS> we're gonna sell a remote control that's the size of this paper book <EOS> you know um <EOS> you say like well that doesn't seem like such a good idea because of x_ obviously go with it . <EOS> i mean we'll discuss it <EOS> but i'm not gonna ask do you know that or uh yeah it seems like <EOS> yeah yeah exactly <EOS> so , <EOS> 'cause we're what <EOS> we're sort of role playing <EOS> is y g <EOS> yeah <EOS> you're gonna tap into your own knowledge as well um . <EOS>
oh <EOS> it is . <EOS> yes definitely <EOS> i'm very sad that i didn't get any links to the corporate website . <EOS> let's see , <EOS> what did i get through the corporate website ? <EOS> it's just inspiration about circuit boards . <EOS> oh <EOS> here you can you can view . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> uh i mean for me if we use a a spongy banana case , doesn't matter . <EOS> i just want to have so something to prin to to fix my my components onto that box , and that's it . <EOS> the only th <EOS> yeah . <EOS> y yeah that can be in inside th in the structure . <EOS> but uh the thing is that the buttons and the wheel have to be <EOS> i mean if it's spongy then the buttons and the wheel have to <EOS> i mean if it's spongy then it's going to move , <EOS> right ? <EOS> so , it's going to be bend a lot . <EOS>
no okay . <EOS> yeah ? <EOS> yeah ? <EOS> of course . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . obviously . <EOS> big , <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> uh and a and a good uh zapping range . <EOS> uh what do you mean by that ? <EOS>
uh <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> otherwise y you ha you have a s ve very normal uh thing like this . <EOS> it's evident . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm . <EOS> so <EOS> twelve euro fifty , we got two off of the battery , <EOS> we can't do anything about that , <EOS> so ten fifty , <EOS> if we want an l_c_d_ dispra display , that's seven fifty <EOS>
well <EOS> all you have to do is touch the screen <EOS> and it automatically goes on . <EOS> yep . <EOS> goes into a sleep mode . <EOS> mm . <EOS> oh <EOS> to wake up <EOS> okay <EOS> or go into like a dormant mode . <EOS> okay . <EOS> oh yeah i like that i like the idea of um putting the logo in the boot up screen , nice . um . <EOS> um cool <EOS> so <EOS> any last things before we break ? <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> and um if you just think about it as the one to the right but with the numbers and the four buttons plus maybe a centre one with teletext . <EOS> so we're suggesting doing a sorta scroll wheel thing for the volume ? <EOS> ye no it's not <EOS> i i it's just four buttons that are on a cross , <EOS> so that you ba basically can control all of the important tasks from that alone . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> right . <EOS> that's page one of my presentation . <EOS> so <EOS> the uh method . <EOS> we're gonna have to understand how remote controls work and res uh successfully complete this project . <EOS> um remote control works as follows . <EOS> this is all pretty basic stuff you guys . <EOS> um sends message to another system , <EOS> so <EOS> there's an energy source involved in that like a battery or solar power , something along those lines , <EOS> there's an integrated circuit , <EOS> which is the microchip , <EOS> um and that actually compose the messages <EOS> and usually the way a a remote control works is it sends infrared bits to another system . <EOS> a user interface controls the chip , <EOS> basically that's the casing and the buttons and um accordingly the messages as well . <EOS>
hmm . <EOS> but um this is the second uh important uh aspect , <EOS> and i think uh we must use some of the new technology , to be uh innovative . <EOS> but we already have the flashing flashing light <EOS> on the <EOS> uh maybe maybe something new . <EOS> we have to discuss about it <EOS> s <EOS> uh okay , uh <EOS> features not uh do not exist in current remote controls . <EOS> and that's very hard i think . <EOS>
i don't really like yellow in general . <EOS> hey <EOS> now i understand the random like newsclippings . <EOS> but it <EOS> finish meeting now . <EOS> wasn't it interesting that um <EOS> i thought it was interesting that our market marketing um expert did not agree with the marketing um <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> well <EOS> you do get a bit carried away with things that are tactile , <EOS> you just wanna stroke them and squeeze them , <EOS> and <EOS> hmm . <EOS> and with sports on television . <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay , <EOS> and it says interface . what type and what supplements ? <EOS>
huh . <EOS> ninja homer . <EOS> mm . <EOS> the the red is supposed to represent the whatever else you wanna print on the side of it . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> i think it's quite nice . <EOS> fashion technology or something . <EOS> you can wear homer , <EOS> you can throw homer when you're frustrated , doh . <EOS>
yeah that's right . <EOS> don don't you ha <EOS> don't we have contacts with uh people on t_v_ or or well systems that exist that we can use ? <EOS> cost . <EOS> well this is this is another que <EOS> we still haven't really defined the remote . <EOS> are we still <EOS> you say we're focusing on t_v_ , but is it still a kind of like a universal remote in that it's a replacement remote control , or is this something for our own line of of televisions ? <EOS> 'cause that really makes a big difference . <EOS> 'cause even if we have contacts we can't really produce a remote control that can bring up menus on other other companies' t_v_s . <EOS> it's just there are too many t_v_s out there . <EOS> it's it's not really gonna <EOS>
double curved . <EOS> nice . <EOS> that is cool . <EOS> so , basically , if you hold it like that , the one on your thumb , yeah , the thumb button is the power button . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> your index finger is channel up , middle finger is channel down , <EOS> ring finger is volume up , your pinkie is volume down . <EOS>
ah . <EOS> um . <EOS> okay so special navigation , linear access , random access <EOS> and there's a fourth one no ? <EOS> mm ? <EOS> so the better now for special navigation ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> for special navigation for example you might have a t_v_ in the menu and you going to change yeah ? <EOS> uh . <EOS>
um , we want this to be a marketable product that can be trendy , <EOS> um , a completely new style , so that , um , can really appeal to a , to a generation that doesn't want a simple plain kind of , uh , channel-changer . <EOS> and , um , it needs to be user-friendly for , um , maybe , for an example , for people that , um , can't see the numbers as well , <EOS> or , um , perhaps an ergonomic design . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> then linear access <EOS> then random access . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah <EOS> and also parameter changing . <EOS> so if there are common parameters maybe we should put special buttons for that um <EOS> or maybe we could have everything uh generic <EOS> but uh there are a lot of uh remotes on the market right now and basically this is most of the almost everybody has this stuff . <EOS>
it's the sort of thing that we want people to have prominent dis displayed on their um coffee table to say this says something about me . <EOS> mm . mm-hmm . <EOS> um this is fashionable . <EOS> i , you know , i'm i'm i'm with it , i'm up to date . <EOS> and you know , th the the design that i've got , and and it could be a a home-made design , um you know this says this is not just a a television remote control , <EOS> this is , you know , a fashion accessory . um , <EOS>
how about these ? <EOS> are we wanting them in <EOS> no <EOS> they're just <EOS> is everything gonna be plastic ? <EOS> okay . <EOS> so we're w w quite far over . <EOS> now we're gonna <EOS> something's gonna have to go . <EOS> um we're at sixteen point eight and <EOS>
no i no i i understand what you say , <EOS> but what i'm what i'm , <EOS> okay we probably need to move along , <EOS> but my my concern is trying to find a marketing niche for this product , <EOS> and if i'm coming in with a with with twenty-five euros , which is mid-market price , um then what am i going to give these people for this ? <EOS> so that's just my question , <EOS> but we can keep talking . <EOS>
absolutely prohibitive , <EOS> yeah . <EOS> oh . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> i mean i wouldn't like to say you g <EOS> i mean you get ones that you can switch between multiple units , <EOS> but something that could um operate between multiple units in a more integrated fashion . <EOS> some <EOS> and ideally something into which it would have some at least limited facility for um running macros . <EOS>
okay . thank you . <EOS> hemant . <EOS> um sure . <EOS> so you don't like pink panthers ? <EOS> i like it . <EOS> oh yeah . <EOS> thanks . <EOS> this lapel is coming out once in a while . <EOS> it's not very strong . <EOS> okay . <EOS> so , not the favourite animal , but i think i'll draw elephant . <EOS> i'll try to draw elephant . <EOS> it's a problem . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> and then you can show it to everybody . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> but to write it th yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> it's b bi little bit too big to write . <EOS> it doesn't really write normally . <EOS> it's a bit <EOS>
yes . <EOS> does anybody else wanna draw their animal ? <EOS> suppose i can draw an animal , yeah . <EOS> . <EOS> uh-oh there goes the ten . <EOS> it's a cat . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i don't know . <EOS> they sleep all day , they're easy to draw . <EOS>
you need <EOS> it's just <EOS> yeah . <EOS> fo i it does nothing actually ? <EOS> no . <EOS> just only . <EOS> just se sends the signal , that's it . <EOS> it's a recharger thing <EOS> and uh <EOS> okay w we didn't think a thought about uh integrated scroll wheel push buttons . <EOS>
ah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> um . <EOS> controlled by a brain , huh ? <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> maybe if it's more , if there is a software inside <EOS> that ask you three <EOS> mm-hmm , yeah , sure . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> if it if we want a r universal remote control that we sa like we say before it may <EOS>
okay . <EOS> it's will enlight your house , your home and your t_v_ , so . <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> oh . maybe next if we decide to do something we'd can put light inside . <EOS> yeah , yeah that would be uh an idea . <EOS>
would that <EOS> uh-huh . <EOS> h how does that work ? <EOS> how so so how does that work , <EOS> how do you avoid switching the thing off when you actually wanna press enter ? <EOS> um well <EOS> if you're pressing enter , the the thing would already be on , <EOS> and so maybe um when you press power , initially it turns it on , <EOS> press power again and use that as an enter um <EOS> so you press power after you've <EOS> um well <EOS> i was thinking maybe you to turn it off you'd have to press power twice in succession , <EOS> and maybe power follows something like a channel up channel down power , and then that would make that choice . <EOS>
and then <EOS> okay . <EOS> so on the back it'll have brightness , contrast , <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> anything else ? <EOS> you're also gonna have the channel tuner , as it were . <EOS> uh there's audio functions . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so tuner up and down , i guess . <EOS>
four . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so removing the l_c_d_ um gives us a li more liberty to to have a fancy look . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> and in the sense of innovativeness , with l_c_d_ . <EOS> well it's it's the same for both <EOS> so i will give a five , six . <EOS>
about five minutes . <EOS> and how we were planning to proceed so that at the next uh meeting each person that's got a a a task to do is clear from this meeting what that task is . <EOS> we'll also know w when the next meeting is <EOS> i um so we'll know how long we've got to complete that task . <EOS> and then we can report back at the next meeting <EOS> and say right okay yes , we've achieved this or we haven't achieved this , this is how far we've progressed . <EOS> does that make reasonable sense ? <EOS> so we have to come effectively to the decision on the remote functions so that you can decide what you're gonna be doing . <EOS>
i think it's the most easier thing , <EOS> yeah . <EOS> that's my uh <EOS> and hoping that when we produce a lot it won't be too expensive . <EOS> no . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> well <EOS> we had twelve fifty , i guess , for uh production ? <EOS> yeah . i dunno how expensive an l_c_d_ screen is .
yeah . <EOS> mm 'kay . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> that's fair enough . <EOS> mm . <EOS> but i don't think we're trying to make a universal remote here . <EOS> that's , <EOS> yeah . <EOS> no no we are not making a universal remote , <EOS> we are just looking at uh giving a scenario , i have a t_v_ <EOS> and tomorrow i am going to have set up box <EOS> which is going to sit there and uh it's going to do that job for me . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yes , <EOS> yes . <EOS> yeah , still . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> included , yeah . <EOS> hmm , <EOS> hmm <EOS> yeah mm . <EOS> i'm sorry to interrupt then <EOS> but i just uh recog i just remembered that there was no that that was not um included uh that there was no room for any special features , okay ? <EOS> so to beware of that . <EOS>
so d do people have a preference as far as feel and functionality ? um . <EOS> i feel like this is simil or it's sort of what already exists <EOS> so if we're trying to think of something sort of like new and fun , <EOS> even though this is like what you're init i'm initially drawn to , <EOS> just 'cause it's like comfortable and like not different . <EOS> i sort of like this one , <EOS> like <EOS> i i don't know why , <EOS> it just it's like small but still sort of like cute looking , <EOS> i dunno . <EOS> but i also like the b the side buttons on that one , like i think that's kind of neat . <EOS>
oops , oh dear , <EOS> what happened there ? <EOS> technical help . <EOS> hopefully that'll stay on , <EOS> two-handed version . <EOS> okay , uh <EOS> hmm . <EOS> okay . <EOS> again this is off the top of my head , <EOS> i was gonna do a big cat too , um . <EOS>
mm yeah . <EOS> nope , we're all set . <EOS> um or yeah , just the idea , but i'm not sure . <EOS> so that's something we can discuss as well . <EOS> so those are the three things , <EOS> just not to worry about teletext , uh only control the t_v_ , and um and uh incorporate the uh colour and slogan of the company . <EOS> um so is everybody okay with any of that <EOS> , or do you want me to recap at all ? <EOS>
it mm <EOS> okay . <EOS> hmm . cheap . <EOS> millions . <EOS> mm . <EOS> okay . <EOS> cheap . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> we'll have volume <EOS> and then we will have s particular channel , <EOS> so users can listen . <EOS> the user uh will just be able to say uh please can you uh pump up the vo pump up the volume <EOS> or or it will be something like volume , up , down . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> well what about what you said , like putting the <EOS> just <EOS> just maybe <EOS> yeah . just a little bit of . <EOS> . <EOS> finger grips just on top of the plastic ? <EOS> okay . <EOS> so we would , <EOS> we would have the l_c_d_ screen ? <EOS>
yeah , <EOS> we won't add that functionality . <EOS> okay . course not . <EOS> however , one interesting point is , <EOS> i don't know how serious you were there , <EOS> but we <EOS> if we take some of the ideas why don't we make the damn thing yellow to incorporate the des the colour of the logo ? <EOS>
so you just flip them out . <EOS> okay . <EOS> um have uh one very complicated one on one side with all the d_v_d_ and v_c_r_ access and stuff , <EOS> and then on the other side o one uh a remote control that would be very very simple with just the channel , program plus and minus , and the just the mute button , for example . <EOS> i can real keep it really really simple on one side and the other side be very complicated . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> um , as we said the rubber's probably used for comfort and anti-r_s_i_ <EOS> and that's about it . <EOS> alright , <EOS> thank you very much . <EOS> good work everyone . <EOS> bravo <EOS> alright . <EOS> and so now that we've we have a prototype , uh we need to go over the finances <EOS> and seeing if this prototype matches uh what our budget can handle . <EOS> so , i have <EOS>
okay . <EOS> so let's go for lunch then . <EOS> thank you very much . <EOS> agreed . <EOS> thank you . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> huh . <EOS> okay , so the leadership <EOS> was there a leadership and <EOS> of course there was . <EOS> okay . <EOS> what do you have to say about that ? <EOS> no , i think <EOS> yeah . <EOS> who was the leader ? <EOS>
okay . <EOS> but there's balance between function and the cost . <EOS> so maybe it will be easier for you to to design it , to have very powerful and easy . <EOS> and also we want the image of the uh um real reaction be recognisable in the product , such as the colour and s the slogan . <EOS> i mean that's uh if uh you want to buy a remote control and if you go in a shop and if you see the remote control you will recognise directly that s it's our product . <EOS>
um . <EOS> s <EOS> shortcuts . uh . <EOS> i think we should we could that <EOS> we could also implement a audio settings , screen settings and channel settings , but as sub-menus . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm . <EOS> d <EOS> mainly if you turn the uh remote control on , you have to u you have to see from one till zero , channel and volume . <EOS> and if you want to use teletext screen or audio , then you can press it . <EOS> it should be available <EOS> but not <EOS>
well , <EOS> just kinetic then , . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> um what's a hand dynamo ? <EOS> that was the crank , wind-up crank on the side . <EOS> it's the wind-up . <EOS> oh <EOS> shoot , <EOS> forget that . <EOS> kinetic is um <EOS> and how many of those will we need per <EOS> we only need one . <EOS>
uh <EOS> well , the thing is uh you you don't <EOS> yeah , but if like you're on the phone in the other room and you need turn television off or something and you don't really want to go into the put the telephone down , and go into the other room . <EOS>
yeah , <EOS> i think this if you you have to n know if it's for s a t_v_ , a d_v_d_ player , all that things . <EOS> also from a user , but all these things together . <EOS> yeah , everything . <EOS> okay . yeah , <EOS> it's also about strength and uh for everything uh . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> right , mm . <EOS> and that took off , yeah , yeah . <EOS> so . <EOS> so say with the f with the findings , with the research , easy to use something totally new . <EOS> we have to come up with something totally new that is not on the market . <EOS>
i is there any of these criteria that need any explaining ? <EOS> or is there anything that yous thought tha really would stand out compared to the others ? <EOS> um , a few . <EOS> um . okay . <EOS> slight problem we had <EOS> was that we have an amazing four euros over budget for what we were hoping to do . <EOS> um most of it stems from the use of the l_c_d_ <EOS> which i think in the end accounted for about half of our expenditure <EOS> because of course we required a chip as well . <EOS> um the only way to get this down was either to ditch the a l_c_d_ , <EOS> at which point we've removed a large part of how we were gonna interface , <EOS> require more buttons , etcetera . <EOS> or what we did was that we um we as in i as i was quickly going over it was altering the actual structure . <EOS> um changing it to plastic and a solid unit with a single curve design would allow us to come back into the um proposed costs <EOS> and we're just scraping it in , <EOS> we've got point two of a euro left over there . <EOS> so we're just managing it really . <EOS> even then as well , um there was no criteria technically defined for a joystick <EOS> so i've used what i think's appropriate . <EOS> with any luck that won't mean that we've incurred more cost than we can actually afford to . <EOS> it blows a lot of our really good ideas kind of slightly to one side , <EOS> for example the possibility of having a u_s_b_ connection is definitely not viable now . um . <EOS>
basic questions like , you know , does it turn on ? <EOS> does it respond to voice recognition ? <EOS> and overall , in general , it looks like it's coming up to par . <EOS> um , the only thing is with with the pull-out panel , that is , can it take some adjusting <EOS> because it's a new sort of interface , <EOS> um that looked like it was coming up rough , <EOS> but then , once you get used to it , it does make a lot of sense . <EOS> so i think overall we're headed in the right direction . <EOS>
oh right . <EOS> we're not catering to the pensioners of the world i don't think so . <EOS> yes . <EOS> so maybe this we should look into this younger demographic . <EOS> um . so <EOS> right . <EOS> uh we need to wonder ah h about how we make it better and smaller and faster <EOS> um think we're constrained to plastics <EOS> very well , <EOS> we've got this idea , ron was saying we need to think about uh revolutionising the way it's looking um , <EOS> which might be easier <EOS> given that we're going for simpler function <EOS> and that we're only going for a telly . <EOS>
so you can use your gesture . <EOS> that's no problem . <EOS> yeah <EOS> but how how is how risky is it to trust like speech recognition or gesture recognition ? <EOS> broken arm ? <EOS> for limited vocabulary speech recognition is very reliable and for s limited vocabulary gesture recognition is also very <EOS>
mm , i gotta think about it for a second like . uh <EOS> does it have to be functional , trendy and user friendly ? <EOS> i don't think so . <EOS> um . <EOS> okay , i'll draw . i'll draw one . <EOS> make sure my things here . <EOS> uh-oh . <EOS> right . <EOS> okay , my favourite animal is <EOS> see . <EOS> oops . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> yeah . yep . <EOS> mm , <EOS> tha <EOS> maybe we ought to reconsider everything with this , yeah . <EOS> well yes , well uh <EOS> re reconsider it . <EOS> so <EOS> let's let's try to to model this this phone in this sheet , <EOS> uh what kind of energy source uh <EOS> i i <EOS> we didn't speak about that . <EOS> it's a it's a normal battery , or <EOS>
yeah , yeah . y y yeah , yeah . <EOS> yeah , yeah that's special colours , sure . <EOS> mm . yeah , we have four . <EOS> five . <EOS> five ? <EOS> okay . <EOS> scroll wheel . <EOS> we don no . <EOS> no . <EOS>
yeah ? <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay , so um <EOS> we did some research , <EOS> we asked one hundred people their opinions on remote controls . <EOS> we asked some uh open ended questions , <EOS> just , what are your opinions on the remote control , <EOS> got a lot of re responses , <EOS> and we asked some very specific questions , <EOS> and we got a lot of good feedback . <EOS> please bear in mind this is only a hundred people , <EOS> so even when the groups are divided into fifteen to twenty five , twenty five to thirty five , there's only maybe ten people fifteen people in each group . <EOS> okay . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> shake it and the buttons fall off . <EOS> durable . <EOS> but you know , those'll be firmly on . <EOS> oh no the plus . <EOS> you're <EOS> use the zero . <EOS> make a new one . <EOS> no , i guess , i don't know much about the remote control industry , how much your average sells for , <EOS> but <EOS> i know i am , aren't i ? <EOS>
mm-hmm . hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> then it will be like if you switch on your t_v_ through anoth another source , not from through a remote remote controller and you you lost your remote controller maybe you can find with the light . <EOS> maybe we can have that . whenever the t_v_ is on , remote controller will have a light . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> having just listened to what corinne just said , <EOS> i'll draw on some of the things as well . some things that sort of relevant to what i wanna say . <EOS> 'kay so <EOS> i'm just gonna yeah approach the technical functions design . <EOS> um the method i used was to explore the uh technical functions of a remote control . <EOS> and t s simplest approach that i came to is is to change , programme and operate an electronic device remotely . <EOS> i mean that's an obvious thing to say , <EOS> but it's not attached to the device that you want to control . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> press on . <EOS> i've looked at looked at a num uh couple of other uh remote control models just for an idea of basic design principles . um <EOS> and wasn't really satisfied by what i saw i have to say <EOS> so this is more sort of springboard for uh how these could be improved on . <EOS> um um basically the job of the device is to send commands to an appliance , in this case the television set . <EOS> um to save you getting off your backside . <EOS> um and there's two main trends in th in the sort of design practice . <EOS> on the one hand and this uh this particularly relates to its sort of earliest models where with you know i so so many buttons on it <EOS> so about the size of the television set . <EOS> um giving you every possible function that the that the device has , the remote control controls . <EOS> and most of these functions are not going to be used , <EOS> it creates a rather user unfriendly interface . <EOS> and on the other hand there's a user focused approach <EOS> that pares things down to just what what is most likely to get used . um <EOS> with uh a and a <EOS> and of course there is a certain amount of sort of loss of function here obviously , <EOS> but mostly that's relatively peripheral functions . <EOS> and so you go for something that's fairly intuitive to use , <EOS> and um well f the for the most part for t_v_ remote it's uh tha that would be channel control and volume . <EOS> um and if you if you if you are wanting to incorporate uh control of a d_v_ d_v_d_ or uh v_c_r_ presumably into that then there's a play , pause , stop , rewind , fast-forward , record , so forth . um . <EOS> my own view is that we should definitely be going for a user focused design . <EOS> um but uh the pro i think the problem with a lot of the sort of user focused designs that are about is that they sort of make assumptions in advance <EOS> about what uh what a given user's going to uh want mo want to do from want it to do most . <EOS> so , <EOS> something that's uh something that is more programmable , <EOS> that uh perh perhaps has the full range of functions available to it <EOS> but you can then specify yourself what you're most likely to want . <EOS> um so that those are then immediately accessible through fairly minimal number of controls , <EOS> um i liked ebenezer's idea of including a joystick in that and uh possibly a sort of fairly minimal number of sort of function buttons , <EOS> and have a disp <EOS> you then have some sort of basic display on it <EOS> so that if you're um sort of cha changing from different modes for the device it'll tell you just exactly what uh you know each direction of the uh of the um joystick's going to do or wha or what each function button's going to do . <EOS> um , this is actually a again slightly taking inspiration off of uh games controllers , <EOS> you know <EOS> the playstation control where you have four basic function buttons <EOS> that are just marked with um distinctive uh geometrical shapes <EOS> but the <EOS> and then dependent on what you're doing with it what game and so on um those uh those functions are then sort of further specified . <EOS> and so it's taking taking the lead from that . <EOS>
that should hopefully do the trick , um . <EOS> 'kay . <EOS> sorry about the small delay . <EOS> falling a little bit behind schedule . <EOS> and that's uh fifteen twenty five . <EOS> okay . so <EOS> just to try and roughly go over what we agreed in the last one , um <EOS> we're gonna go for something uh uh how was it ? <EOS> uh the new black , i believe . <EOS> um something that looks good <EOS> 'cause that seems to be in preference to actual functionality in the end , <EOS> though we should never avoid functionality , of course . <EOS> uh many of our components are gonna be standard , off the shelf , <EOS> but it seemed like we were gonna require at least an advanced chip <EOS> and we were still very much for the idea of using an l_c_d_ display . <EOS> um other things were we were hoping to use rubber , <EOS> most likely gonna be double curved , etcetera . <EOS>
i g i i figured you would . yes . yeah . <EOS> it could be fun . <EOS> it's actually a novel thing <EOS> because you could sell it a as a novelty , <EOS> just to be actually serious for a minute here , <EOS> you could <EOS> yeah . <EOS> well it is it is more uh i mean it is more eco-friendly than the than the cradle <EOS> 'cause you're still using power off the grid with the cradle . so um <EOS>
okay we all all set ? <EOS> right . <EOS> well this is the uh final detailed design meeting . <EOS> um we're gonna discuss the look and feel design , the user interface design , and we're gonna evaluate the product . <EOS> and the end result of this meeting has to be a decision on the details of this remote control , <EOS> like absolute final decision , <EOS> um and then i'm gonna have to specify the final design in the final report . <EOS> so um <EOS> just from from last time to recap , <EOS> we said we were gonna have a snowman shaped remote control with no l_c_d_ display , no need for talk-back , <EOS> it was hopefully gonna be kinetic power and battery uh with rubber buttons , <EOS> maybe backlighting the buttons with some internal l_e_d_s to shine through the casing , <EOS> um hopefully a jog-dial , <EOS> and incorporating the slogan somewhere as well . <EOS> anything i've missed ? <EOS> okay <EOS> um so uh <EOS> if you want to present your prototype go ahead . <EOS>
no . <EOS> any any thoughts about buttons or any oth other way of approaching the p the uh the problem ? <EOS> or anybody else , strong feelings about remote controls ? <EOS> are there you know , bad ones they've used <EOS> or good ones they've used <EOS> or ones that they've lost and never found again ? <EOS>
mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> no i think i think batteries are probably the way to go . <EOS> no . hmm . <EOS> alright . <EOS> uh which makes it very conventional but therefore traditional i assume . <EOS> um <EOS> yeah . <EOS> um <EOS> with the titanium um we cannot make it a curved design . <EOS> we would just be able to make it flat and <EOS> and um yeah <EOS> a straight design pretty much . <EOS> which i assume would exclude uh some of the more sophisticated versions . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> so a device for for all remotes . <EOS> sorry , <EOS> you go . you go . <EOS> i've <EOS> okay . yeah . <EOS> um one of the things um we found from the market research is that people often get confused by the number of buttons on them as well . <EOS> 'cause there's quite often lots and lots . <EOS> and um sometimes uh they sort of remote controls defeat their own purpose <EOS> because you're sat in the chair and the remote is somewhere else in the room . <EOS> so whereas in the past you'd have to get up to change the channel , <EOS> now you have to get up to sort of pick up the remote . <EOS> so so i don't <EOS> we need to sort of maybe think about how um we could maybe uh develop a remote control which moves around the room . <EOS>
that's right . <EOS> does that include charging circuitry and everything ? <EOS> yeah maybe . <EOS> okay good . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> wha <EOS> excellent . <EOS> so what do we do with the extra profits ? <EOS> um we'll invest in r_ and d_ . <EOS> okay . <EOS> the next fruit . <EOS>
no , not too small , yeah . <EOS> yeah yeah , <EOS> at least it should hold in your hand n properly , like . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> yeah , like a palm sized . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm . <EOS> just to hold it . <EOS>
uh maybe . okay <EOS> but i will i will personally won't give it beyond three . <EOS> so we can <EOS> no , i mean uh obviously your opinion , <EOS> i'm just trying to <EOS> okay . <EOS> he's a tough cookie . <EOS> yeah , on an average we can think three , four sevenths , maybe . <EOS> three or four ? <EOS> uh , no sorry , <EOS> it should be <EOS>
yeah i go four . <EOS> three and an half . <EOS> alright , and the last criteria is it is it um <EOS> squishy and fruity . <EOS> it's just trendy , basically . <EOS> well yeah , so i'd give it a two . <EOS> well , we've covered that with the <EOS> trendy . <EOS>
and i dunno <EOS> um , so we've got seven fifty to use for the case and for the buttons . mm . <EOS> and the chip . sorry <EOS> the chip's up there already . <EOS> mm-hmm , mm-hmm . <EOS> so we're gonna have to scale this down to get within budget , <EOS> there's no doubt about that . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> that they've they've put across are what is used in some stress ball manufacture <EOS> and it's meant to be anti r_s_i_ . <EOS> i'm no i'm not sure how that would work because surely your fingers would still be moving over the short distances <EOS> but that's what they said . <EOS> um the problem with the casing is that uh there's <EOS>
f_ eight ? <EOS> well . <EOS> how do i get it <EOS> slide show . <EOS> to go to the next one ? <EOS> yeah <EOS> you click on that guy . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> oh right right right . <EOS> that one ? <EOS> okay . <EOS> alright . well , <EOS> this is my report , <EOS> which is going to be based pretty much on a survey <EOS> that i was sent . <EOS>
so uh <EOS> good morning . <EOS> i see you all find your places . <EOS> is everybody sitting on the right place ? yeah ? <EOS> i guess so . <EOS> so <EOS> morning . <EOS> morning . <EOS> morning . <EOS> yep . <EOS> let's see . <EOS> first i will introduce myself . <EOS> i don't know if uh if everybody knows me , <EOS> so <EOS> i'm bart , <EOS> hello . hello . <EOS> bart . <EOS> hello . <EOS> hello . <EOS> bart . <EOS> welcome . <EOS>
okay um , <EOS> just to generate a little bit of discussion about the project um , i could i'd like to hear about your experiences using ro remote controls , <EOS> um your first ideas about um creating a new r remote control , <EOS> what would be the best um like you what are the features that you really like <EOS> what are the features that you don't like , etcetera , <EOS> so <EOS>
and mute . <EOS> for muting the uh <EOS> um and then then you can also there's a numeric keypad on the top so you can key directly to the to the channel if you want . <EOS> so it's really basic functionalities as far as what keys are available , <EOS> but we think it's very comfortable and very innovative and it looks different . <EOS>
okay , <EOS> cool . okay <EOS> thanks . <EOS> thank you . <EOS>
but then that that surely d depends a little on the t_v_ <EOS> because some t_v_s are quite slow at changing channels from like so <EOS> if you've got a scroll wheel and you s you have to scroll scroll it really really slowly just so that you're actually keeping in pace with the t_v_'s ability to to change channels . <EOS> or do you have to go through and you wait for it ? <EOS> you scroll it a bunch of times and you wait for it to <EOS>
no they're not , <EOS> but they're they're they are easy to find . <EOS> to handle . <EOS> true . <EOS> i would rate it a <EOS> yeah , they are a lot easier to find than uh th than on the regular remote controls <EOS> where you have to uh find out what which sign or icon means on uh every button . <EOS> so you have t you have to use the the the manual to understand most <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
so <EOS> i i give yeah i just give a call with the manufacturer <EOS> uh and uh i explained them <EOS> and they told me this could be possible for sixteen fr euros . <EOS> uh unfortunately we didn't see this chip , uh matthew , <EOS> so maybe we have to recap with this one . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> no , <EOS> i think oh . <EOS> it's right . <EOS> think the scroll wheel won't be very big . <EOS> since if you put it uh somewhere , the chances that it will scroll are too big . <EOS> so it will just be a small <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> during our design i mean there was some s some heated heated discussion , <EOS> but we we kept we tried to keep it cool and and <EOS> did you have to go down to the the corporate squash court and bash a few balls about ? <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> there you go . <EOS> um so in closing , <EOS> i haven't got my five minutes to go . thin <EOS> oh there it i <EOS> five minutes to go . <EOS> wonderful . <EOS> okay um <EOS> are the costs within the budget , yes they are . <EOS> and is the project evaluated , yes it is . <EOS> so now celebrate . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> okay so <EOS> yes . <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah , probably <EOS> yeah , probably it's a <EOS> yeah , yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> and uh <EOS> so the light sensor would activate the signal . <EOS> that's right . <EOS> you know there would be <EOS> right you have to have some kind of sensor <EOS> and i i think uh voice or clapping it's not specific enough . <EOS> uh i know there are the lamps and stuff , you know , you can clap on and off , <EOS> but i think they only work to certain degree and <EOS>
hmm . <EOS> it's really kind of a <EOS> yeah , we really like we really like that design , <EOS> i mean it looks just like a logo , that arrangement of the keys . <EOS> like a c like a compass point , <EOS> you know , <EOS> just up , down , left and right , <EOS> and we think we could make that quite a good feature . <EOS> and it's like the the ipod scroll wheel , but better . <EOS> yeah . yeah , yeah , <EOS> i mean it <EOS> that's what it makes me think of , mobile phones , <EOS> i was try <EOS> i was thinking , moving your thumb like this , what does that remind me of ? <EOS> it's texting . <EOS>
just build it in . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yes . <EOS> in codes , y you you get a b a book with codes . <EOS> you look up , <EOS> i have a philips h_ fifty five <EOS> and it says press code four five five <EOS> and you press code four five five on the uh in the remote <EOS> and it displays all your uh menu options . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> because it has to be fed with energy . <EOS> okay . uh <EOS> the subcomponent is uh w i i think it is uh the button pressed . <EOS> so basically <EOS> when you press a button , a switch get closed . <EOS> um that's connecting to a chip . <EOS> so the chip knows what button you pressed . <EOS> and the chip sends out uh the pattern to the infrared bulb . <EOS> i didn didn't put the description by this one . <EOS> th this is a normal bulb . so the normal flashing light . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> um , what else , uh <EOS> so don't need to worry about teletext , <EOS> don't need to worry about v_c_r_ , <EOS> uh any kind of like display controls at all do you think we need to worry about , <EOS> you know like brightness and contrast ? <EOS>
i w well uh i <EOS> maybe we should concentrate just on the whistle back function at the moment , <EOS> and if something comes back <EOS> something simple . <EOS> uh if if our primary consideration is to get it there in time , time's short , <EOS> you want something to meet the major concerns of the consumer so that we can have that as a selling point for the product , <EOS> something that's quick and simple . <EOS> so , <EOS> sounds good . <EOS>
yeah , <EOS> it's probably my job to figure that out , <EOS> but <EOS> no , <EOS> that <EOS> uh one to have in channel one ? <EOS> yeah , <EOS> then th we have to think about that . <EOS> but do do we do it ? <EOS> it's more if we if we do it . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> mm that's true , yeah . <EOS> i'm thinking however mac ipod is sort of last year's <EOS> because it's very hard and sort of glassy and glossy , <EOS> so i'm thinking if we imagine that we're taking some of the features of a mac ipod <EOS> and we're then making it s more of like a more of like a comfortable type of <EOS> or more of like a <EOS> maybe more vibrant to friendly thing to have . <EOS> um and then so this is <EOS> w with all that information what i'm what i'm suggesting in this slide here is that we we take these ideas , <EOS> and as we get into more the more um techni like sort of production side of things , <EOS> that we think about shape , materials , and themes or series that go throughout . <EOS> sort of like a <EOS> i dunno like um <EOS> we think of some kind of a thin theme that unifies it all , <EOS> that we agree on , <EOS> uh sorta like a marketing identity . <EOS> um <EOS> does that make sense ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so so like i threw out a few ideas there just to kinda get us thinking along those lines like lemon , lime , i dunno , green colours , pe whatever , <EOS> it's just an idea , <EOS> 'cause i'm thinking that some of these ideas will seem quite coherent if we use them in terms of their what people associate this them with in terms of texture , shape , colours , things like that . <EOS>
'kay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> um i'm not entirely sure what the corporate colour is . <EOS> it might be yellow , because there seems to be a lot of yellow everywhere . <EOS> and the slogan , like the actual written slogan , or just to embody the idea of the slogan ? <EOS>
kids . yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so you're more likely to b <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> and if we're if we're talking twenty five euros as a price , that's not unaffordable , even for young people . <EOS> no , <EOS> i mean that's what , that's like fifteen pounds ? <EOS> you know , i think <EOS>
oh yeah . <EOS> oh <EOS> i need to muck around with this . <EOS> it's probably easier if you put it on yours <EOS> and then i'll just email it to you . <EOS> it's just a web link . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> yeah <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah <EOS> these numbers have have to be have to be taken into account
yes , <EOS> i can go ahead . <EOS> last presentation . okay . <EOS> you do ? <EOS> the last presentation . <EOS> you have plenty of time , <EOS> tim and uh janus don't uh talk to ten minutes , <EOS> so uh <EOS> take your time . <EOS>
you want to have more functional buttons ? <EOS> looks a bit puzzled <EOS> uh i dunno how to say that . <EOS> you the the b the buttons change h h their function depending if y it's teletext or not <EOS> you are not convinced . <EOS> not not many , we we want to keep it simple . <EOS> so that this button fo is for teletext which is usually also the case , <EOS> that usually there is a teletext button and once you press that , the channel buttons , they baco become the scrolling buttons . <EOS>
okay , <EOS> can i have the laptop over here , or ? <EOS> okay <EOS> . have to get up . <EOS> yep . <EOS> oh , i don't think so . <EOS> i think you have to come here . <EOS> i dunno . <EOS> i think it should stay . <EOS>
yeah , but uh i need something in the writing , <EOS> so like uh what's your functional design , what's your technical design , and uh how many people you need for this project , and what's the time frame you're looking , okay , and what is the budget , maybe uh initial budget you're looking , okay , and uh how is going to the market , okay , <EOS>
mm , so can i just recap uh sarah , <EOS> for the decisions that we've made , kinetic charging , the watch-type batteries , <EOS> um l_c_d_ display on th the top side of the flip top , rubberised buttons on the bottom side , <EOS> we're gonna use fruit and vegetable colours for the rubber cover , the case itself is plastic . <EOS> that's how far we've got , <EOS> what else do we have to add to our decisions here ? <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> could we get something that <EOS> mm . <EOS> just has <EOS> no <EOS> doesn't have all the buttons that you need to program the video recorder <EOS> or program s other things that i'm not very coherent about , <EOS> but that just has your major buttons for that work for everything , you know volume control , on , off , <EOS>
okay . <EOS> 'kay so we'll try to zip through this , since we're short on time . <EOS> welcome everybody . <EOS> um hope your sessions went well . <EOS> um so this is our functional design meeting , <EOS> we're going to consider um user needs , technical effects , and the working design of our remote control . <EOS> um i've been taking meetings on the minute minutes on the meetings , <EOS> and i'll be putting them in the shared documents folder <EOS> so if there's anything you need to refer to you can find them in there . <EOS> um i i'll get the ones up for next time , <EOS> um they're not finished yet . <EOS>
nice , <EOS> eh ? <EOS> yep . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> thank you . <EOS> now we just have to save everything , <EOS> so . <EOS> oh <EOS> this is definitely the best one . <EOS> uh . <EOS> okay , so uh <EOS> what we know is that we have to sell this uh remote control for about twenty five euros . <EOS>
no . <EOS> black , all black . <EOS> mm . <EOS> well . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> so , <EOS> yeah . <EOS> black colours . <EOS> well <EOS> maybe we should try to make it fun . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> they use batteries <EOS> and batteries <EOS> uh and poor signal . <EOS>
yeah . okay . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm-hm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> so you will have to use the colour of the product , of the um um <EOS> okay . <EOS> of the uh of real reaction <EOS> okay . <EOS> so . and uh also <EOS>
i dunno what uh kind of material it is . <EOS> but <EOS> yeah . <EOS> but maybe you can m make a uh round fluff or soft material . <EOS> just only the basic uh <EOS> oops . <EOS> basic remote control from normal plastic , <EOS> and <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> five minutes . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> five minutes ? <EOS> okay , <EOS> i'll wrap it up quickly . <EOS> um i personally think it has to be multi-purpose . <EOS> uh most of the remote c uh remote controls are uh just for one purpose . <EOS> and uh by making it multi-purpose , it uh has a new feature , adds a new feature to the market , <EOS> and distinguish from uh from current products . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> well they do , <EOS> but i think we can you could <EOS> well it is , it is , <EOS> i think you just address that with um advertising . <EOS> um , you associate the name with the individual product that it is <EOS> and that does the work for you . <EOS> obviously it'll have a logo on it just like everything , <EOS> but everything else has a logo on it . <EOS> the point is that it's got to stand out somehow differently <EOS> but i think it does , without that <EOS> so i'm not worried about that . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> but then you have to remember what favourite is what channel . <EOS> so you might as well remember the number . <EOS> or not ? <EOS> no y <EOS> maybe i maybe it's too complicated , <EOS> but not sure . <EOS> it's a good idea , <EOS> but <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> and uh what's the idea about uh the shape of the remote controls ? <EOS> uh can they be made into a fruit and vegetable types ? <EOS> well so <EOS> yeah yeah <EOS> i think we are <EOS> yeah <EOS> but we are also the um well the components will have to change <EOS> because uh we have to deal with the shape <EOS> and um but i don't think it will uh increase the cost too much so <EOS>
it was interesting what came out like later , like as i was doing the when i was doing the breakdown on the agenda that they gave me um , that more points came out from your presentation even . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm . <EOS> um . i'm a little i am a little disappointed that we didn't do a um something for losing the remote , <EOS> because that was kind of a big point . <EOS>
yeah , this is . <EOS> see there's a role for everybody . <EOS> yeah , that's right , <EOS> first . <EOS> even for the marketing . <EOS> us user define . <EOS> next . <EOS> but look at your role , your marketing role . <EOS> there's a trend watching . <EOS>
most of it , <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> i added slides , um i added a couple slides each time , <EOS> but that was about it . <EOS> oh . <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> i didn't even think about adding slides , <EOS> 'cause i would just get slides with titles on them <EOS> and fill them all <EOS> in w <EOS> didn't even think about adding more . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> that's avoidable . <EOS> coulda been worse . <EOS> okay so <EOS> are the costs within the budget ? <EOS> mm n no . <EOS> no . <EOS> nope . <EOS> oh hang on it really <EOS> that's something we that the costs were under twelve fifty euros . <EOS> no requirements are changed . <EOS> we're still under twenty euros to build , so we're good . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> oh watches i've but i've never washed a cell phone . <EOS> ouch . <EOS> a phone , whoa , that would wow , that would hurt . <EOS> okay , so what kind of material do we want to be made out of ? <EOS> pieces everywhere . <EOS> well , we have lots of options . <EOS> i don't think wood is a viable option . <EOS>
nine . <EOS> one point six , <EOS> one point <EOS> mm nine by five , one point s eight ? one point eight yeah . <EOS> this one , eleven thirteen nineteen twenty one , divided by five is four point two yep . <EOS> four point uh four point two . <EOS>
okay , <EOS> what ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> sure . <EOS> why not ? <EOS> okay . <EOS> the one thing i'm wondering about , i hope that we're not going like too much down a gimmicky road of of having <EOS> i mean if somebody go goes into the store they're gonna see like three or four normal remotes , and then a big spongy pink t tomato uh remote . <EOS> i mean what are ninety per cent of people gonna take ? <EOS>
huh ? <EOS> what about the integration of speech recognition ? <EOS> the speech recogniser is a add-on module . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> right ? <EOS> that's going to be an optional . <EOS> if somebody wants to buy it they can have it , otherwise no . <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
no . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> small logo with the like a small yellow strip or y yellow with the logo in it . <EOS> having a little bit . <EOS> okay cool . <EOS> surrounding the logo . <EOS> mm mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm , okay . <EOS> cool . <EOS>
okay , well . <EOS> thanks for looking at that . <EOS> okay . mm-hmm . <EOS> we don't wanna outsmart <EOS> hmm . <EOS> congratulations . <EOS> mm . <EOS> uh . <EOS> so i guess easy to use is the other thing that we want 'em to be able to do . <EOS> as you said , you know , don't make it too hard for the granny . <EOS> i just joined that set last week . <EOS> um first grandchild arrived . <EOS>
uh-oh . <EOS> we're looking at a radically different shape . <EOS> possibly no buttons at all um , <EOS> but if you can incorporate um channel change and volume buttons um in into the design , then then that's fine . <EOS> um in the i mean the the role of the of the um the user interface des designer becomes b you know more important here , <EOS> because , you know , shape is no longer an a uh um a serious constraint . <EOS> but we clearly only need th the main buttons , although , uh if clearly only need the main functions . <EOS> um i don't see why we shouldn't go for voice recognition <EOS> um and the the only buttons that i think we need are channel control , volume control and on off . <EOS> um it needs to incorporate the corporate logo , uh the the grey and yellow colour scheme <EOS> and there's no reason why we can't introduce um interchangeable uh covers . <EOS> um uh d so does that accurately summarise what we've discussed ? <EOS>
um , so i was quite pleased with that . <EOS> one thing that we didn't do <EOS> um obviously we had a choice with the buttons <EOS> whether to use scroll buttons or standard rubber buttons , <EOS> but we just went for a classic rubber button <EOS> and um since we did that <EOS> we didn't have to use as many microchips <EOS> which was quite nice <EOS> and that's what helped keep the cost down . <EOS> so even though it has a lot of modern technology , um for example the voice recognition , <EOS> in a lot of ways it's just a simple remote <EOS> and um i think if we shopped around for other manufacturers um we might be able to get even cheaper . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> yeah we probably should . <EOS> we we're doing alright for time . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> sorry that kinda cut into you there . <EOS> well no <EOS> just i i would i would advocate for continuing teletext and those would be the basic commands . <EOS>
so that might be an idea of using the rubber , <EOS> but then it should , you know <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> let's have a squeezable remote . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> and also it doesn't break as easily maybe , <EOS> i dunno <EOS> when a t_v_ programme's got one <EOS> watching the match and your team's just lost , you can fuzz it across the room and it'll bounce off the wall back at you . <EOS> yeah , i like that idea . <EOS>
normal for logical t <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah they're used to it . <EOS> okay the yeah . that's possible . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> on once it's on it's on . you don't need the power button . <EOS> yeah , okay . <EOS> okay we put it on top . <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
but <EOS> but shouldn't you put a button of for teletext on the for the people who want to use it ? <EOS> sorry ? <EOS> yeah , it could be . <EOS> remembering we have got a big remote that you have to fill . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . yeah , <EOS> and we could make an a a separate menu on the l_c_d_ uh screen for teletext . <EOS>
yeah yeah . <EOS> yep . <EOS> yeah bu but we we're designing only the remote , <EOS> we not design the t_v_ . <EOS> so uh we're gonna be removing the teletext out of any t_v_ okay . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> 'kay . <EOS> that we people use our remote with .
mm . <EOS> the situation . <EOS> very good point . <EOS> because tha w with speech recognition uh th i'm not that good at that idea <EOS> but th <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> if it's a one-word recognition , <EOS> 'cause i know with telephones and cars and things i've seen in the states , <EOS> a friend of mine says call mom , <EOS> and it calls up mom . <EOS>
that would be me . <EOS> yep . <EOS> alright . <EOS> well . <EOS> mm . 'kay . <EOS> function f_ eight it . <EOS> there we go . <EOS> alright . <EOS> um i'm very excited by this one actually guys <EOS> i uh had a lot of fun doing it . <EOS> components design . <EOS> this is where you look at what does it take to make a remote control <EOS> and what should we make our specific remote control out of . <EOS> um .
could you plug me in ? <EOS> okay . <EOS> thanks . <EOS> okay . <EOS> um just want to tell you that you have three new requirements , <EOS> um which is the the first one is that um uh the company's decided that teletext is outdated uh because of how popular the internet is . <EOS> nobody uses teletext very much anymore , <EOS> so we don't really need to consider that in the functionality of the of the remote control . <EOS> um they've also suggested that we um we only use the remote control to control the television , not the v_c_r_ , d_v_d_ or anything else . <EOS> i think the worry is that if the project becomes too complex then it'll affect um how long it takes us to get it into into production , the time to market . <EOS> so um , we're just gonna keep it simple and it'll just control the t_v_ . <EOS> and the other thing was that the company want the corporate colour and slogan to be implemented in the new design . <EOS>
sorry ? <EOS> it's true . <EOS> i have another meeting <EOS> so if you could uh <EOS> you have another meeting soon ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so you have to be quick . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> for the lawnmower project . <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS>
and possibly the thing about the about the remote being lost we could have you know with your mobile phone , you lose that and you can ring it . <EOS> maybe we can have some kind of sensor which is kept somewhere where you can some kind of buzzer system between the two . <EOS> so you can press a button which is always kept in one place <EOS> and then it maybe buzzes to somewhere else , wherever the remote actually is . <EOS>
uh-huh , <EOS> okay . <EOS> but it's not bad leadership , it's just sort of s fairly strong , you know . <EOS> it turns it turns the individual into more of like a um sort of a predetermined mechanism , as opposed to a sort of a free <EOS>
exactly . <EOS> you know , a little flap th with a little control panel on the actual box itself . i i wouldn't know how to do it using a remote control , <EOS> so exactly . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> um i would say that they are definitely less relevant .
now ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> you wanna start us off ? <EOS> anybody have anything to offer ? <EOS> well , we wanna make a multifunctional remote , <EOS> right ? <EOS> one remote for everything . <EOS> right . <EOS> and everything being wait , we have what , sound system , t_v_ , d_v_d_ , v_h_s_ , uh tivo ? <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> okay . functions . <EOS> okay . so <EOS> mm okay . <EOS> and just to have uh an idea , do you think you as the user interface designer to would it be possible to have less buttons and still have the same functionality and to have powerful remote control , you think it's possible ? <EOS> sure ? yeah ? <EOS>
it's not . <EOS> yeah . yeah . <EOS> thirty . <EOS> yeah . yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> remote , now we're up around about twelve , twelve and a half as to what uh the company had initially uh requested . um so that means we can put the uh
mm . <EOS> um well <EOS> i i think other than ge getting a sort of more aesthetically pleasing form for it , <EOS> um mo most of the sort of layout design decisions are are made , i would say . <EOS> um but then again , the um the menu structure to to a considerable extent that's gonna vary according to the model of television , and also any customisations that the user might wish to incorporate . <EOS> so um <EOS> and one of the nice things about having an l_c_d_ and a menu structure is that there is that flexibility to it . <EOS>
right . um <EOS> so f from the <EOS> just before you start , to make it easier , would you three mind emailing me your presentations ? once we <EOS> you don't have to do it now but when once you go back , <EOS> just so that i don't have to scribble everything down . <EOS>
make a r <EOS> yeah . <EOS> nee . <EOS> and i didn't know what to do for the first ten minutes before we got here , <EOS> so i went , right . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> just looking at the screen <EOS> and uh <EOS> yeah , so <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> and that's to be fair the um the per cent of the market <EOS> we're not going for mass any you know , mass sales anyway , <EOS> we're gonna make <EOS> i mean we we're not talking about selling eight zillion of these things , <EOS> we just couldn't , not for twenty-five euros , <EOS> so <EOS>
that's what i was saying . <EOS> gotta cut up . <EOS> exactly . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> the last remote you'll ever buy . <EOS> and also presumably they've <EOS> and and then and then design the product , maybe some component of the product that can identify this as the last one you'll ever need to buy . <EOS>
no problem . yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> alright . <EOS> alrighty . okay . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS>
okay , <EOS> that was definitely something we can talk about . <EOS> um so <EOS> you've got a little bit about the the chip that we might require as well ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so , <EOS> depends where <EOS> gonna spend the money if you want the f fancy l_c_d_ display . <EOS>
they want like the flashy lights . <EOS> oh like this came from las vegas . <EOS> but at the same time are simple . <EOS> mm yeah . <EOS> right . <EOS> so that people like my mother can use it . <EOS> what about something with the curvature like that matches the curvature of a hand ? <EOS>
hope everyone memorised that uh <EOS> you <EOS> i mean <EOS> it might be to look at sort of the the shape and trend of like things like mobile phones , and the shapes that the they've been going . <EOS> they've gone from big brick block things , which is a remote control is , to sort of slinky small things . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> but <EOS> it's yeah it's <EOS> yeah . but we we've got the two so two uh two or three uh new things , huh ? <EOS> and maybe we uh maybe learnable is in uh compare of old fashion uh remote controls . <EOS> so we h we have speech , uh the scroll wheel , and um the the the slide . you must slide it . <EOS>
uh 'kay . <EOS> so <EOS> so so so . <EOS> put on your mic . <EOS> so you forgot how this works again ? <EOS> boss . <EOS> yep . <EOS> boss . <EOS> maybe . maybe maybe maybe . <EOS> okay so we're here to talk about the detailed design of the product , <EOS> 'kay ? <EOS>
yeah , firmware upgrade . <EOS> ah . <EOS> maybe w <EOS> that's maybe the cup holder . <EOS> no m may no , <EOS> maybe we can incorporate some kind of uh u_s_b_ or a firewire connection , <EOS> so that you can uh connect it to the p_c_ <EOS> and download the newest firmware from uh from the internet . <EOS>
so it's a speech synthesis kind of thing , <EOS> something has been uh stored and it's just uh spoken out . <EOS> it's speech <EOS> it's it's speech synthesis and s it's speech kind of , not really speech recognition , but kind of pattern matching , yeah <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
actually , yeah <EOS> w <EOS> uh w y you two should should , i think , think this over uh w espec what , what functionality . <EOS> let's let's take <EOS> of course , <EOS> and first before um designing the func <EOS> well <EOS> thinking about the functionalities , we need to know what are the user requirements . <EOS> um then if they need internet , then we would be able to to p to propose something with uh uh t_v_ over i_p_ . <EOS> but before
bu but um but the spongy idea i like . i like it a lot . <EOS> we seem to have quite a general consensus that the idea of the the r rubber could be quite <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i having it i having it sort of br bright yellow i think that's quite a good idea , <EOS> though maybe we could have options for colours as well . <EOS>
good to see you all again . <EOS> let's see if that comes up . <EOS> this is our functional design meeting . <EOS> um . just a sec while my powerpoint comes up . <EOS> et voila . <EOS> okay . mm um <EOS> we put the fashion in electronics . <EOS> let's start . <EOS> okay , <EOS> our agenda today um <EOS> just check the time , <EOS> it's twelve thirteen . <EOS> um . i'm gonna do an opening , <EOS> talk about um <EOS> did you all get the minutes ? <EOS> i e-mailed them to you . <EOS> i'm also putting 'em them in the shared folder . <EOS> so um then i we'll talk about our general objectives <EOS> and have your three presentations . <EOS> um i'll talk about the new project requirements i've just received , <EOS> and then we have to make a decision on our remote control functions . <EOS> finally we'll just close . <EOS> we're starting this meeting at approximately twelve thirteen <EOS> and we have forty minutes . <EOS> so <EOS>
they can add two colours . <EOS> but the colours . um how ma uh the colours like l she told , is that all the colours we add <EOS> or <EOS> how d uh uh how many colours ? <EOS> special colours , all the colours you want , <EOS> because you want to make p <EOS>
yeah , <EOS> so the target price is for all europe , or only for rich countries ? <EOS> it's more targeting u_k_ or <EOS> i don't know . <EOS> wha the initial specifications were for the whole all europe or <EOS> uh <EOS> so this is selling costs , not production costs . <EOS>
no . <EOS> yeah , we have battery . <EOS> no , <EOS> um solar cells , yeah . <EOS> uh i think in each ball you have three <EOS> three uh yeah , <EOS> three , yeah . <EOS> three three solar cells . <EOS> as number of branches ? <EOS> three ? <EOS> so , <EOS> electronic . <EOS> single simple chip on print ? <EOS> just one would be necessary ? <EOS> one ? <EOS>
okay , <EOS> you wanna integrate everything into one like <EOS> yeah , <EOS> 'cause you <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> my experience has only been being given the remote control with the object i buy , <EOS> not doing any tampering with it and programming , <EOS> using it to programme t_v_ and uh uh videos and things . <EOS> but basically on , off , volume up and down , channel one , two , th that basic functions , <EOS> i don't think i could go any further with it than that , <EOS> so , i suppose it's got to be something usable by someone like me as well . <EOS>
uh <EOS> so <EOS> the first one is really standard , <EOS> so everybody i including our grandmothers can use it , <EOS> right ? <EOS> mm . <EOS> he is used to it act <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm . <EOS> they are used to it actually . <EOS> yep . <EOS> so that's maybe a a two for ease of use . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> for the locator . <EOS> but that's a bit of a gimmick anyway really , isn't it ? <EOS> we can afford to get rid of it . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm and the locator also goes away . <EOS> but it was very no innovative <EOS> innovativeness . well um yeah . <EOS>
that's a good idea . <EOS> you can i yeah . <EOS> ma <EOS> also , but but i i i think uh the the goal is to sell our remote control . <EOS> s okay , so charger for is the . <EOS> bu <EOS> i dunno . <EOS> yeah we can change the b . <EOS>
so we need to check their specifications <EOS> and do their uh encryption <EOS> that's passing information to the t_v_ device . <EOS> so we need to have particular encryption codes . <EOS> okay . <EOS> then , components , <EOS> so we have the main uh energy source <EOS> and then we will have some buttons <EOS> and then we will have infrared uh source <EOS> and then we have some inside some chip in in the device . <EOS> uh since i don't have much time <EOS> so i'll input the connections to all this components . <EOS> and since i also want to know feedback from our marketing expert and user interface , <EOS> so if you want to add some more components we can incorporate them . <EOS>
as long as the pla uh the rubber is nowhere near the controls , yes . <EOS> 'kay . <EOS> so i guess the case would be plastic , <EOS> with perhaps that's not even enough rubber to qualify as being part of it . <EOS> it's more of a su it's more of a supplement maybe . <EOS>
yes . <EOS> think i'll go first . <EOS> okay . <EOS> so <EOS> just maybe it's easier if you um <EOS> yeah <EOS> i think you will tell your presentation as well . just which function you have <EOS> and what you're gonna talk about . <EOS> 'kay . <EOS> my name is freek van ponnen . <EOS> i'm the market expert . <EOS> but you already knew that . <EOS> um i've done some research . <EOS> we have we uh have been doing research in a usability lab <EOS> where we observed um users operating remote controls . <EOS> uh we let them fill out a questionnaire . <EOS> we had one hundred of these uh test subjects . <EOS> uh in addition we did some market research . uh see what the market consists of . what ages are involved . <EOS> well <EOS> these are three quite astonishing results , i thought . <EOS> um remotes are being considered ugly . <EOS> f <EOS> uh seventy five percent of the um people questioned uh indicated that they thought their remote were was ugly . <EOS> um and an additional eighty percent indicated that they would spend more money on a fancy-looking remote control . <EOS> so <EOS> um in addition remotes were not very functional . <EOS> fifty percent of the people indicated they only loo used about ten percent of the buttons on a remote control . <EOS> and fifty percent of the people indicated that their remote tended to get lost in their room . <EOS> so <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> we didn't use the whiteboard at all . <EOS> no , we didn't . <EOS> we could now if that'd make up for it <EOS> but really <EOS> and i feel like if you guys had been designing in here perhaps that would have changed <EOS> but because of room constraints , doesn't really matter . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> seems like a a lot of the components could be off the shelf , <EOS> so <EOS> i don't exactly what cost would be incurred . <EOS> um i can see your point about the number keypad , <EOS> but i've <EOS> i would say that we can probably incorporate it into the menu system if you need to do traversal of a large number of channels . <EOS> my feeling would be that even if at a later date this was to be taking control of um boxes as well <EOS> um having the use of the l_c_d_ and the joystick would probably allow you to manipulate enough channel numbers <EOS> for you to be <EOS>
mm . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> it's true . <EOS> mm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> you know . <EOS> . <EOS> 'kay good . <EOS> yeah <EOS> so <EOS> i don't know how if if i have time to talk about the <EOS> mm yes um <EOS> i would <EOS>
right . <EOS> one problem you'd get with this design is <EOS> um the ball is a nice idea <EOS> because of it's stability really , <EOS> but of course , since it's a ball , <EOS> it'll roll , <EOS> so we'd have to have it flat on one side at least , down here somewhere , <EOS> take away that part . <EOS> that's one of the big issues . <EOS> also also you risk the hinges here . that's that's um a problem . <EOS>
yeah . yeah okay yeah . <EOS> mm . <EOS> that doesn't really work . to draw , i guess . <EOS> huh cool . <EOS> no it's <EOS> . <EOS> oh . what's this ? <EOS> yeah it's text . <EOS> right . <EOS> n no you have to exit . <EOS>
ooh 's not what i wanted to do uh uh . <EOS> um yeah <EOS> use that thing you can go back , previous . <EOS> previous . <EOS> sorry about that , guys . <EOS> pardon . <EOS> oh . <EOS> oh , well . <EOS> okay . <EOS> no , no , no , no , no . <EOS> okay , <EOS> let's just get back to my schematic here . <EOS>
yeah <EOS> but we would increase the price to try to make it a trainable one , so <EOS> mm . <EOS> okay . <EOS> well i dunno . <EOS> one way the other teletext was there <EOS> but i guess we can remove it <EOS> or , you know , make two separate interface designs . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> and you've got the facia , and you can just talk at the <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> maybe . <EOS> okay , um so <EOS> so you've narrowed it down to half a dozen options . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> s i guess we decided on material , <EOS> right ? <EOS> so that that spongy latex rubber everything feel , <EOS> and the colours we got down , <EOS> and the shape , maybe we'll just make it kinda mix and match type of shape or <EOS>
mm i was thinking of the <EOS> maybe something that sounds cool in english but sounds funny in spanish . <EOS> mando . <EOS> what is that ? <EOS> mando . <EOS> mango ? mango ? <EOS> mando . <EOS> m_a_ ? <EOS> mando . <EOS> m_a_ ? <EOS> a_n_ yeah d_o . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> so no l_c_d_ ? <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> and so no speech as well because it w it would delay too much the development process <EOS> . okay . <EOS> well if it's going to delay yeah <EOS> but uh it will be cool . <EOS> it would . <EOS> because a user could say c_n_n_ for example and it would go c_n_n_ . mm . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> the next meeting starts in thirty minutes , <EOS> although does it ? <EOS> it starts at three twenty one , the next meeting . <EOS> so we've got more than a thirty minutes . <EOS> um we've got more like fifty . <EOS> well i have <EOS> is my <EOS> three twenty one is the next meeting ? <EOS>
mm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> it's supposed to fix it rather than cause it . um . <EOS> you know , we're gonna we <EOS> we're gonna as a sort of extra something on it , <EOS> you know what what extra things are there extra things this product have ? <EOS> we'll look into this lock key <EOS>
mm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> good good . <EOS> yeah <EOS> that's uh that's something which i wanted to ask you also , <EOS> like what will be the each individually the cost of it . <EOS> for example if f if you want to put wood i wouldn't suggest for wood <EOS>
mm . <EOS> the numbers yeah . <EOS> yeah <EOS> they can see how much buttons there are going to be on on the display , <EOS> and if it's too much we can uh reconsider it . <EOS> but i think there won't be very much buttons . <EOS> or there don't have to be a lot . <EOS>
yeah . so it can bounce . <EOS> yeah , uh <EOS> it's very no it's very strong . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah okay so that that may work . <EOS> that actually will offer some extra protection for the <EOS> okay but then we still have the the the thing of the the the shape . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> mm . okay <EOS> and then uh what's the colour ? <EOS> how do i do <EOS> it's in format . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> ah . <EOS> i'll take this one . <EOS> uh there has to be water , <EOS> but <EOS> just <EOS> no <EOS> it has to be an animal , <EOS> so if that's it's <EOS> it should be a shna snake or something . <EOS> okay . okay okay . okay . <EOS>
mm <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> that's all ? <EOS> okay , so mm <EOS> so well done for the presentations . <EOS> so we need to take some de decisions about um about what we're going to do . <EOS> so i i propose that you go to the whiteboard <EOS> and we're going to report all the ideas we had we had during this these presentations <EOS> just to draw some sketch about what will be the prod final product <EOS> and uh where superman go banana and uh <EOS> uh extra func functionalities such as wheels , um the speaker unit um well not in order not to lost the um the device , <EOS> i do i don't remember you call it ? <EOS>
okay , i'll go next . <EOS> i am a big animal lover . <EOS> i like all sorts of animals , but for the moment i'm gonna draw a cat , in memory of my poor cat that died recently . <EOS> oh . <EOS> oh . <EOS> it's gonna be a bit of a strange drawing , <EOS> but never mind . <EOS>
um <EOS> as susan said , p <EOS> except for in every other faculty . <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah ? <EOS> is that so ? <EOS> yes , it is so . <EOS> every other faculty as far as i have seen their offices and the people that i know and that's in um in law , uh socio-economics , uh okay ? <EOS>
right . <EOS> i don't see the necessity of an l_c_d_ either . <EOS> don't see it . <EOS> you know the other thing i thought about was you know , do we go to something like this ? <EOS> make a remote that doesn't look like a remote . <EOS> it's just another it's just a an idea , <EOS> and i don't know <EOS>
huh , the powerpoint one ? <EOS> hmm ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay . cool . <EOS> you've found it all ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so it was um <EOS> yeah true's one . <EOS> true's one and false is seven . <EOS> do you want us to discuss this together or do you want us to do it singly ? <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> so what if what <EOS> this is <EOS> i'm just forming this idea in my head of how this thing is looking . <EOS> if you have like that stress ball material kind of as what you're actually holding in your hand , <EOS> so like what you're feeling is comfortable , <EOS> and then there's more of a hard plastic thing where that thing is . <EOS> and on that hard plastic thing you can change either the colour or the fruit or vegetable that's on there . <EOS> is that kind of <EOS> i 'cause i i'm thinking of silver because those are our company colours . <EOS> um <EOS>
w <EOS> sure . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> well i think wh what it would be is like like the m like this , where it's maybe you know a digital wheel , right , where it's where it's quantized into you know certain <EOS> mm . <EOS> oh yeah . <EOS>
it's okay . <EOS> 'kay . <EOS> very nice . <EOS> now we actually have some ideas of what what people want , <EOS> what we should focus on . uh <EOS> wait <EOS> can i look at that real quick ? . <EOS> oh yeah . <EOS> sorry <EOS> did you guys get time to write everything that you needed ? <EOS> 'kay . <EOS>
for detection , right . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> learning how to use it should be as simple as possible . <EOS> but there aren't gonna be that func that many functions incorporated into it <EOS> so it should be fine <EOS> and the i the instruction manual , i don't know if we deal with that , um . <EOS> i think <EOS> yep , <EOS> and different from what's out there . <EOS> yep , i think that's us . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> so <EOS> the fruit design um <EOS> how about um affecting the surface of the actual um remote control ? <EOS> say we don't make it p a particular fruit shape obviously , <EOS> but uh give it like the surface of <EOS> mm . <EOS> an orange , banana , whatever . <EOS> you name it . <EOS>
to get at a international market <EOS> uh so um <EOS> it will be i think mainly europe and uh northern america , <EOS> ah yeah , the sale man , four million . <EOS> maybe some uh asian countries . <EOS> um also important for you all is um the the product uh production cost must be maximal uh twelve uh twelve euro and fifty cents . <EOS>
yeah i think so . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah well mine was mostly made up <EOS> except when they told me like you know titanium costs more than wood to make a remote control . <EOS> as if you'd wanted to . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> but it must have been quite difficult for them to build a whole um <EOS>
hmm . <EOS> okay , <EOS> pretty huge margin . <EOS> half of the selling price is taken up by building it . <EOS> um , and profit aim is fifty million euros , <EOS> which is uh <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> in our first year ? <EOS>
no no . <EOS> i dunno , i dunno it . <EOS> ah yeah . mm . <EOS> okay . <EOS> so maybe this is better , to send it by email . <EOS> okay ? <EOS> so yeah i i'm <EOS> it's in the first uh email so i'm participant one at ami <EOS> uh where is that , <EOS> it's here . <EOS>
hmm . <EOS> interesting . <EOS> that would be amazing , though , yeah . <EOS> no , splinters would <EOS> yeah . <EOS> um certain restrictions do apply here though . <EOS> uh latex , you can't do solar power with a latex one . <EOS> so , if they want some a soft squishy rubber , they can't have the solar powered option . <EOS> double-curved , you can't do titanium . <EOS> um that would be two curvatures , <EOS> so it would actually , if you the shape of your hand , you curve here and you curve here , so you could have two curves that match the shape of your hand to make it more comfortable to hold . <EOS> now if you wanted that , you can't do titanium . <EOS> and uh so you functions what for the buttons , scrolling function could be very beneficial to us instead of actual buttons themselves . <EOS> i think i have one more slide . <EOS> no , i didn't . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> this is going to be the on off button <EOS> and we have these buttons to go through the channels <EOS> um and then two volume buttons down here , <EOS> d uh we decided those were the most important uh buttons . <EOS> and then , for the more advanced uh functions there is a slide out panel here <EOS> um and you can see that there are lots of other things going on . <EOS> but this actually can slide back in <EOS> and provides a very nice aesthetic when it's all put away , um . <EOS>
that's all . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> um maybe what we could do is t th think about a concept which touches b back to the on the um the colour , <EOS> you said company colour yellow . <EOS> i mean if we think of something , <EOS> like i was saying also lime and lemon you know , <EOS> what can we come up with something where we we try and associate it with with like the series . <EOS> we just come up with something like that we kind of use it as a theme to inspire the <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> incremental definitely because zapping you you switch them . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> let's say that we can do something like that . <EOS> this is uh incremental , but once you press it for a long time , you go five by five . <EOS> we go faster ? <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> this normal battery , <EOS> so this battery , once you s switch on it will take power <EOS> and we can have some speech recognition and in our g generally small digital signal processing chip <EOS> so that and we will put uh the small uh simple speech recogniser <EOS> and we can also train the speech recogniser for particular user <EOS> so you just <EOS> yeah , <EOS> so that we just use simple recog <EOS> no <EOS> but but <EOS>
t <EOS> i i'm curious about what the de-briefing is gonna be like . <EOS> you know , like <EOS> what is the uh <EOS> what exactly we're looking for here . <EOS> so <EOS> is this all we need to get through ? <EOS> i dunno , <EOS> i'm not sure what the new ideas found i is about . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah we do . <EOS> ah . what do you know . <EOS> oh it's a that's not very special , it's pretty <EOS> o okay so we're <EOS> if th . <EOS> push-button , scroll wheel , we're basically we have uh th <EOS> is this intended to be a button as well or just a scroll ? <EOS> just a scroll ? <EOS> it's not one of the scrolls where , for example , with this one you could push it down to be a button ? <EOS>
i'm marketing . <EOS> marketing . <EOS> yep . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yes . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> sure . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yes . <EOS> oh . <EOS> i'm matthew . you know . <EOS> matth s uh <EOS> anna . <EOS> and <EOS> um uh matthew , yeah . <EOS> i thi think you know me , <EOS> yeah ? <EOS> right yeah . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , 'cause they're pretty <EOS> and just like <EOS> the toronto district school would only use his macs with their kids . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> exactly , <EOS> so i associate them with like really low-tech , really cheap , bad <EOS> yeah . <EOS> just the mac font bothers me even . <EOS> but i do like ipods , <EOS> go figure . <EOS>
mm no . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> no that's not gonna work . i guess . <EOS> maybe we should <EOS> yeah . <EOS> but is it a problem that left-handed persons use a different hand ? <EOS> i think the functions are <EOS> um <EOS> that basic that nobody should have any problems with uh choosing a channel <EOS> or <EOS>
mm okay . <EOS> and i'm supposed to present this scale on the whiteboard . <EOS> um and we're supposed to talk about those things as a team now , <EOS> so if you put my last slide back up there . <EOS> oh . <EOS> i'm sorry <EOS> i've um forgot to do that , um . <EOS>
the next channel in the numeric pattern , or <EOS> no , swapping is if if example you're you're watching the second channel and then you go to the tenth channel and if you want to go back to the second channel you can swap , this button . <EOS> yes . <EOS>
oh yeah , right , <EOS> we want it to it's not it's not no . <EOS> yep . <EOS> fifteen , <EOS> oh , too bad . <EOS> l_c_d_ display . <EOS> not going to work ? <EOS> okay . okay um <EOS> oh <EOS> but with special colour we have . <EOS> a special form , <EOS> right ? <EOS>
inch . <EOS> oh , . <EOS> oops . <EOS> uh first thing is uh this will be the overall shape , <EOS> no uh i'm not speaking about the real shape of the device , but the shape of the inside of the device . <EOS> so there will be some circuit uh for the power . <EOS> so , say power circuit here . <EOS> uh the main energy will be taken from batteries <EOS> that we can uh uh <EOS> and if we decide to use the speech recognition stuff there , we must use additional source of energy , <EOS> which i found the best is to use the solar cells which can which can uh supply everything . <EOS> i was computing all the all the things related to the speech recognition , and it's okay to use just uh two batteries and solar cells , so . <EOS> so no problem . <EOS> there can be also solar cell . <EOS> uh the main board with all the circuits will take at least seven to seven centimetres , <EOS> so this is my like hard requirement for the guys from the design . <EOS> so at least seven to seven . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> yeah , uh maybe to as uh it it was indicated that uh uh risk uh of uh repeated use , the injuries , maybe a touch screen could be a better option for that . <EOS> yeah . yeah . <EOS> so , a bigger b <EOS> okay so y you're dividing designs based on not only segment age groups , <EOS> you're desi uh dividing it according to the countries also , the market . <EOS> maybe for u_s_ and all you can have a slightly bigger remote control <EOS> and maybe in japan and all you need to have a small , yeah . <EOS>
yeah yeah yeah . <EOS> yeah . mm-hmm . <EOS> the other way . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> o on the toilets or <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> um , actually , yeah , maybe we should remind that quite a lot of professors at the at the school actually share their office with their assistant . <EOS> so b it looks like sort of an implicit tradition . <EOS> maybe not to be followed . <EOS>
like a you feel a bit like a dog with this stuff . <EOS> okay so i'm just going to describe <EOS> in fact for for a remote control this is quite easy . <EOS> we just have <EOS> sorry , <EOS> i'm going <EOS> okay . <EOS> are you okay ? <EOS>
no they do , they do . <EOS> they listen to it . yeah . <EOS> right , okay . <EOS> 'kay <EOS> but people tend to recognise certain shapes to do certain things anyway , don't they ? <EOS> yeah , exactly . <EOS> um f_ five . <EOS> yes . <EOS>
and quite complicated to use , <EOS> yes . <EOS> s so we can try to go in between , <EOS> and offer a product which is not as expensive and not as mm-hmm . <EOS> not as flexible maybe , <EOS> yeah , <EOS> but s <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
yeah okay . <EOS> uh . <EOS> but if we would make um a changing channels and changing volume button on both sides , that would certainly yield great options for the design of the remote . <EOS> mm . <EOS> 'cause it could be made all symmetrical and stuff . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> mm . <EOS> um but it's something to think about , yeah . <EOS> i mean we'll have to see how much that would be . <EOS> well , i guess we have to get to that later , yeah . <EOS> or some it i <EOS> we can find out probably on the internet how much it's <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . a good good good thing . <EOS> you want to g to move to your slides ? <EOS> you're finished ? <EOS> but uh <EOS> yeah , that's right , yeah . <EOS> well i just i just made the point , <EOS> i don't i don't know if that speech recognition is , you know , even if we can do it , i think it's not really appropriate for uh television environment . <EOS>
what turnaround time do we have ? <EOS> t <EOS> 'cause i mean production evaluation can be very very quick or very very long . <EOS> oh but <EOS> yes it's it's very quick , of course . <EOS> it will uh come back in two weeks , okay , <EOS> it will be ready in two weeks . <EOS> for evaluation , okay . <EOS>
and the volume ? <EOS> volume . <EOS> shall we have a mute button as well ? <EOS> um . <EOS> sorry ? <EOS> a mute button as well . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> or <EOS> yeah <EOS> i think they're handy . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> and probably a power one as well . <EOS> dunno . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> can we uh power a light in this ? <EOS> can we get a strong enough battery to power a light ? <EOS> um i think we could because the l_c_d_ panel requires power , <EOS> and the l_c_d_ is a form of a light <EOS> so that <EOS>
okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> play-doh time . <EOS> yeah quite jealous actually . <EOS> you got to choose first . <EOS> no , we're kidding . <EOS> okay , <EOS> can i just swipe your power cable , <EOS> i don't think it matters . <EOS> okay lemme okay , <EOS> i'm gonna pull everybody out first and then put in whoever needs to be left . <EOS> it's you . <EOS> argh . <EOS> this is a real hassle and a <EOS> oops . <EOS> i'm gonna take the microphones , 'cause it's too lazy t take them off again . <EOS> cool . <EOS>
mm , if we only have twelve pounds fifty , <EOS> twelve euros , not even twelve pounds . <EOS> twelve euros , what's that , like eight pounds or something like that , nine pounds ? <EOS> well <EOS> we'd also be relying on the um the bulk buying in producement and such . i assume . <EOS> we have to look into the costs of those . <EOS> so , <EOS> sorry . <EOS>
alright . <EOS> yeah . alright . <EOS> the real remote . <EOS> yeah . i like it . <EOS> okay . this can go . <EOS> so maybe you can include that somewhere . <EOS> good . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> we should work in our own room right ? or not ? <EOS>
um i would say we should say dumber than the average person . <EOS> we should go for the lowest denominator . <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> right , okay . <EOS> high school educated . <EOS> so so they need no technical experience to operate <EOS> how 'bout little to no , <EOS> because there is no way that you are gonna be able to make it no . <EOS>
excellent , thank you . <EOS> oy , <EOS> big loop under the table . <EOS> she said we didn't need to screw it in . <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay , that looks good . <EOS> it's doing its thing . <EOS> there we are . <EOS> alright . <EOS> thank you very much . um . <EOS> one of the the biggest issues i found about um from last meeting was the fact that we need to sell four million of these um remote controls <EOS> and i think that this is an opportunity to really take real reaction in the direction of of similar of handheld tools that have been used and are used by many of us and to kind of bring the remote control into the si same realm as an accessible um useful electronic device , as opposed to something that is lost in the couch and what have you . <EOS> so um <EOS> my main goal here is to re-envision the remote control in in this context <EOS> and to think about menu functionality and current technology <EOS> and the fact that it could be interactive with other tools . <EOS> um some of the research uh in the market has shown that people really are not happy with remote controls as they are now , <EOS> and um that means we do need to make some decisions about what what keys or or buttons on the on the remote control to perhaps keep and and what ones to discard . <EOS> and if we devote some energy into this , i think the um recent productions of real reaction , the i go everywhere power and the high definition d_v_d_ players although it makes immediate sense to have our remote control interact with these , <EOS> i think we can also use this as a platform to make it interact with other tools . <EOS> and um in fact i think the high definition d_v_d_ players and all of this will come along in the uh will only benefit from the positive feedback from our well designed tool . <EOS> so <EOS> again , most uh users really dislike the current look and feel of remote controls . <EOS> um fifty percent <EOS> i think of all these uh numbers the most important is <EOS> fifty percent of user say they only use ten percent of the buttons . <EOS> and eighty percent of users , <EOS> and if we think about this there are a lot of uh television , d_v_d_ , stereo remote control users out there , <EOS> eighty percent would spend more money on a remote control that looks fancy . <EOS>
large . <EOS> if you have older people or people like me that aren't very co-ordinated hand-eye , it's really quite important that you are not pressing a small like teeny mobiles phone size buttons , if we can help it . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> and maybe y <EOS> experienced yeah . <EOS> but uh all incorporated in the screen or or just on the remote itself ? <EOS> na <EOS> i w i should uh put uh the the yeah the extra advanced options on the onto the onscreen display . <EOS>
you wanna go to this next slide , marketing expert ? <EOS> uh , well i isn't this my last slide ? <EOS> maybe . <EOS> go ahead . <EOS> i think that was my last slide , yeah . um . <EOS> i dunno . <EOS> yes it is . mm-hmm . <EOS>
sorry <EOS> i did this in a bit of a rush . <EOS> n name . <EOS> so so here's a look inside your really old-looking remote control . <EOS> um you've got a printed a printed uh circuit board here , <EOS> and you've got all these buttons which kinda press down little rubber nubbies into these little holes that activate <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> you're the one that's gotta go and find out do th do the research , <EOS> see what people want in a remote , what buttons are used more often , and s stuff like that . <EOS> mm . <EOS> oh , we've been warned to finish the meeting now . <EOS> okay . <EOS>
long term . <EOS> mm . <EOS> cool . uh <EOS> yeah . <EOS> and we're having a custom chip ? <EOS> we're having a a custom chip , <EOS> but given the the we've cut the functions down , <EOS> um that will hopefully not be too problematic , <EOS> but given that um technol technological innovation is important , <EOS> then we need to , <EOS> i'll say it again , technologically innovate . <EOS>
indeed . <EOS> so <EOS> that will be about functionality <EOS> mm . but if people are buying a new remote control for functionality they'll buy a universal remote . <EOS> i've got friends who've got so many things they need a universal remote , <EOS> otherwise they're using five different remotes for their all their things . <EOS> in that case they wouldn't buy our product , <EOS> because it doesn't give them what they need in terms of functionality . <EOS>
i think one factor would be production cost . <EOS> okay , yeah . <EOS> because there's a cap there , <EOS> so um depends on how much you can cram into that price . um . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
p <EOS> yeah . <EOS> . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so that's another marketing point that we can use . <EOS> well the rubber push-buttons . don't you have to move your <EOS> but anything is gonna have buttons . <EOS> mm . <EOS> even if it's a jog wheel , it's still repetitive . <EOS>
so <EOS> hmm . <EOS> every time i have to come down on this price again to <EOS> so this might be a little limiting for your creativity , <EOS> but it's it's it's the real <EOS> hmm . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> we have to consider it . <EOS> s so <EOS> do we think these ideas an and my uh sp speech recognition , i mean maybe it's possible for for twelve euro <EOS> but then then it will be at cost of other functionality we might implement like the uh uh the the the furry uh uh case of the <EOS>
the battery . <EOS> no . <EOS> um . <EOS> we need an <EOS> and that's because of cost restraints is it ? <EOS> okay <EOS> um what about the electronics here ? <EOS> advanced chip . <EOS> yep . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah advanced chip . <EOS> we need an advanced chip i think , yep . <EOS> let me just confirm that . <EOS> yes i think so . <EOS> yep . <EOS>
this one . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> open uh . <EOS> uh open . <EOS> do you want to open <EOS> because it's open you mean . <EOS> right , so um i will talk about the the w working design and <EOS> f_ five . <EOS> slide show , view slide show , . <EOS>
'kay . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> um but i don't know if that's really in our field ? <EOS> but that's something that's out there . <EOS> i guess i guess we're going for the biggest market , maybe not , <EOS> but was it was it specified that we went for the biggest ? <EOS>
y <EOS> yeah , <EOS> you y that's a fun that's not the function of the controller , <EOS> that's a function of t_v_ . <EOS> you can replace your t_v_ with a new t_v_ with internet browsing function , <EOS> but <EOS> no , <EOS> but you need you need new remote controller then . because if you wanna browse internet or , i don't know , if you wanna type something , <EOS> or <EOS>
oh gosh . okay . well <EOS> i'll just i'll just reverse them all . <EOS> it's no problem . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> right , well i'm glad this came out . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i thought you guys hated it . <EOS> i was like , why did you guys design it that way if you hated it ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> what ab what ab <EOS> what about a a remote that's that doesn't maybe look like a remote ? <EOS> just an idea . <EOS> just just <EOS> okay 'cause i mean we all know what a remote looks like on the outside . <EOS> they're selling these things everywhere . <EOS> maybe that could be part of our design exclusivity , is we make a remote that doesn't even look like a remote <EOS> it it opens like a telephone . <EOS>
. <EOS> okay . <EOS> if this is your thumb , and this is your hand like that . <EOS> with your uh wrist . <EOS> that you , that it would be kind of shape like this , you know . <EOS> so it's easier to hold in your hand , to y f <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> the advantages of working with plastic and rubber is w we we'll have a lot more um options just in terms of shape <EOS> because you can extrude plastic in basically any shape you want . <EOS> so um and then we can cover you know the breakable bits with rubber yeah so um <EOS>
a <EOS> so wha what what each of us think about the because it's measure point the l_c_d_ , um <EOS> do you think it's important ? <EOS> or we could even replace them by buttons actually . <EOS> because sometimes whe when you watch the t_v_ in fact , you have a big display <EOS> and maybe you don't need one more in your hands ? <EOS> i dunno , <EOS> i'm just asking . <EOS>
but <EOS> mm . <EOS> oh , we can we can keep the idea if you i <EOS> we can see at a later stage , maybe , i don't <EOS> 's just an idea . <EOS> okay . <EOS> right , well done , catherine . <EOS> um gab gabriel let's uh let's hear from you on on on such things . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> and might be easier huh ? <EOS> maybe this . kind of works . <EOS> like if you have like uh ten buttons for for all the for all the channels , <EOS> um and here one for for <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> uh . <EOS> and the for flipping up and down . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so i'm wondering right away , <EOS> is selling twenty five euros , is that sort of the <EOS> thi is this gonna to be like the premium product kinda thing or <EOS> yeah , yeah . <EOS> like how much does , you know , a remote control cost . <EOS>
just having one that's guaranteed to last five to ten years ? <EOS> oh , cool . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> and if if anybody manages to run it down , we'll we'll give 'em a new one . <EOS> um it's , you know , it's what it saves in cost and you know there there's a <EOS> well , <EOS> it's actually a marketing gimmick . <EOS> i mean it's hardly a gimmick , <EOS> it's uh it's totally practical . <EOS> uh so i th think you know the idea of a rechargeable one is um <EOS>
. <EOS> there's a there's <EOS> okay , from from a from a component point of view there's added complexity , <EOS> and you add cost to it , <EOS> um and then there's probably the fact that you need another physical component . <EOS> you need a docking cradle , for example , for you to put it in to charge . <EOS> or you need to get the user to plug it in . <EOS> um and most users are very f use already used to the idea of buying batteries and putting it into the controller . <EOS> but unless the controller's gonna consume a lot of batteries , <EOS> like he's gonna run through like twenty batteries a month , <EOS> then i don't think rechargeable is something we should you know , we really need to care about . <EOS> um . <EOS>
right . <EOS> but i mean the older so <EOS> yeah <EOS> is everyone who in here's right-handed , left-handed ? <EOS> you guys all right-handed ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so <EOS> i'm left-handed <EOS> but i , so i can say that most things are designed for right-handed people . <EOS>
so it's not the draw on it isn't <EOS> okay . <EOS> mm . <EOS> ye yeah i think i th uh g y you could have a dual um power thing <EOS> but the the thing with the solar cells is you would need to put them on the case <EOS> and they <EOS> because , if you lie <EOS> on a calculator they they're qui they're quite big and they all they all look i identical . <EOS>
feels like play-dough . <EOS> they shouldn't really be questions . <EOS> should be more like <EOS> are the batteries easy to insert ? <EOS> i'm gonna say yes . <EOS> yes ? very very true . okay . <EOS> i imagine they're somewhere on the front . <EOS> we have a little case that you slip 'em in . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> what does each of you <EOS> i i kind of think it's it's unique enough that i'd give it a one or a two . <EOS> okay , <EOS> well <EOS> give it a number , <EOS> sorry . <EOS> okay . <EOS> i will give it a one . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> we'd also have to wor um consider that uh who we were gonna get to make these custom cases in terms of manufacturing processes , <EOS> we might wanna um learn about um labour laws . <EOS> you know in different countries and stuff wher so we can do it cheap , <EOS> but you don't wanna exploit uh labour in um third world countries . <EOS> so actually you could turn it y turn around and say that you're uh par the reason the cost is high for the device is because um you're paying a a working wage to the person who made the device . <EOS>
um i dunno if it's <EOS> it's creative . <EOS> i dunno if fancy is the word i would use . <EOS> i dunno if any of them are fancy <EOS> in <EOS> i'd say two , <EOS> because c unique . <EOS> okay . <EOS> and two , <EOS> awesome . <EOS> alright , <EOS> and same sort of scale for functionality , is it functional ? <EOS> i think it's extremely functional , <EOS> i'm gonna give it a one . <EOS>
hmm . <EOS> our technical manager has then said that she feels it should have a chip <EOS> that has infra-red bits <EOS> and it has an interface controls w interface that controls the chip . <EOS> therefore , messages uh will be controlled in the same manner . <EOS> there should be extra features like lid buttons , maybe a beep . if too many buttons are pressed , <EOS> mm uh uh child lock <EOS> um and uh maybe a display clock so that people could um you could see the time , you know , what show they want to watch . <EOS> also mentioned was uh maybe different shapes . <EOS> so the components of the thing should be button , bulbs , infra infra-red bulbs , battery , chips , wires , <EOS> and maybe some kind of a holder uh for the for the uh item . <EOS> francino who is our um <EOS> interface designer um uh has mentioned that the that it , of course , should have an on-off button , <EOS> and also has mentioned an interesting feature that it should have maybe a channel lock . <EOS>
yes . yes . <EOS> so if if he want to view a particular programme at say nine o'clock he can set the time , and the t_v_ will automatically it will switch on at that particular time . <EOS> so he can use that kind of uh uh properties of features <EOS> and then there should be a child lock system if a particular channel is not to be viewed by a particular uh for a certain age , then the parents can lock that particular channel so that the ch children cannot view that channel . <EOS> and uh the uh the uh and the <EOS> one of the feature a user would like to have is the compactness of the co remote . <EOS>
and <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so side . <EOS> five minutes left before the meeting ends . <EOS> 'kay . <EOS> um other views ? <EOS> alright . <EOS> yeah only if you are going to put buttons on the side of the unit . <EOS> uh <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> no , i wasn't , no <EOS> sorry <EOS> i wasn't thinking of the screen of like a p_d_a_ <EOS> but <EOS> okay well right <EOS> we'll have to um i'll <EOS> we're k having another meeting in half an hour <EOS> so um <EOS> we should all look into a bit <EOS>
huh ? <EOS> wh wh what is the limit ? uh . <EOS> twelve point five . <EOS> we have to count all of them , <EOS> or yeah . <EOS> mm i don't think so , no . <EOS> no it says what what is the kind of interface , <EOS> if it is pushbutton then you got a zero point five , <EOS> it's a scroll wheel so we we've put it's pushbutton and scroll wheel and l_c_d_ display , <EOS> so that's that's the three kind of interfaces that we have . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> and then that's it . <EOS> so we've got twenty five minutes to do that , <EOS> that's until eleven twenty five . <EOS> so sh <EOS> s so any any questions ? <EOS> is i <EOS> . <EOS> not at this point . <EOS> not at this point . <EOS>
well , probably the only thing is a banana that i can think of , <EOS> a cucumber . <EOS> banana . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> i dunno . <EOS> or m <EOS> maybe too long . <EOS> maybe . <EOS> too green . <EOS> maybe . <EOS> so , but i mean you also have to you have to also have , fit r all the buttons and you know . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> demonised thing , u um , they're everyone's got like a big pile of them , <EOS> but no one really uses them . <EOS> okay . <EOS> um . <EOS> whoops , questionnaire four . <EOS> oops . <EOS> we should f <EOS> yes , right . okay . <EOS>
yay . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> i <EOS> make it sound eloquent . <EOS> it'd be so cool if we get a copy of the recording . <EOS> oh , <EOS> i have to done i've <EOS> i've done transcription before <EOS> and it's really ridiculous how many words people say like just in the middle of their sentences like that <EOS> that mean nothing . <EOS>
oh <EOS> no , we don't need that . no . <EOS> yeah . yeah , i do i don't think we need that for either of them , <EOS> you can do a banana in single curve , <EOS> yeah . <EOS> right . <EOS> single-curved , i'd say . <EOS>
there are some uh examples of remote controls . <EOS> you can see they are very different . <EOS> the one has got all the functions that you could possibly need and an lot of uh buttons etcetera . <EOS> and the other is uh more user friendly , little with big buttons . <EOS> and uh not n all the the the the stuff you can do with it , <EOS> but uh the the essential stuff is there . <EOS>
single curved . <EOS> flat . <EOS> oh , <EOS> but it's just one <EOS> yeah , <EOS> so that does doesn't doesn't that mu i think <EOS> point , <EOS> so maybe you should should uh <EOS> no . <EOS> scrap sample speaker ? <EOS> that that's uh <EOS> yeah , <EOS> you should you should drop the speech recognition . <EOS>
it would still be comfortable i think . <EOS> we c we could handle it i think . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> thing is like that , it's not going anywhere particularly . <EOS> maybe , it could it could be on the bottom , <EOS> so you wouldn't loo <EOS> like if it's flat here , so it sits up . <EOS> like that . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> ed , d do you know what season of the year or time of the year is the most important for t_v_ remote control sales ? <EOS> hmm . <EOS> would it be the christmas season by any chance ? <EOS> sports season . <EOS> the sports time . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> okay let's just be safe and put like say four buttons for that one . <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay um <EOS> and maybe a special colour for the buttons , so maybe four again . <EOS> four . <EOS> so w why are we arriving at the number four ? <EOS> where does the number four come from ? <EOS>
chew proof . <EOS> well , they'll buy more of them if you eat them , . <EOS> that was the main criteria from the last meeting , it had to be chew proof . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> uh right . <EOS> okay , now i think we'll do this <EOS> i could do you know , i can do this o on my own or i could do it with you , <EOS> but it's just easy enough to go through it with you , <EOS> so we're going for the kinetic power . <EOS>
yeah . once they are finished . yeah . <EOS> yeah but maybe you can do the evaluation you don't have to evaluate yet but you can make a procedure which to follow . <EOS> i don't know . <EOS> yeah . i i probably get instruction on that , how to do that , <EOS> so i make another presentation i guess . <EOS> i kn i know what's gonna happen in in yeah so <EOS>
is this for the case ? yes . <EOS> oh okay , the mm-hmm , mm' kay . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yes . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> and then we have to interface push buttons . <EOS> yes . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> scroll wheel , no . <EOS> integrated scroll wheel , <EOS> l_c_ display ? <EOS>
do you want do you want me to send you a mail ? <EOS> ah it's okay . <EOS> or <EOS> or you can put it in the shared folder . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> you see the email ? <EOS> you email . <EOS> the v very <EOS> no , no <EOS> the first one . <EOS> it's inside . <EOS>
silver , yeah . <EOS> silver . <EOS> i think you see more silver than black . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> you see a lot of t uh silver televisions . <EOS> but still silver and black are <EOS> well <EOS> silver is new but also traditional , <EOS> so uh <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> s <EOS> mm , i dunno . <EOS> people are stupid . <EOS> i guess it i it sort of a grey , <EOS> isn't it ? <EOS> yellow and grey , <EOS> but then the slogan's in blue . <EOS> well <EOS> we got some grey <EOS> and we got some blue buttons , <EOS> we're good . <EOS>
easy t <EOS> yeah , <EOS> i think this is easy now . <EOS> i think th i think the options buttons are not the the easiest way to to <EOS> yeah , <EOS> and you use these buttons the most , <EOS> huh ? <EOS> so <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
that was pretty cool , <EOS> it was a high moment of the whole experiment . <EOS> um . <EOS> mm . <EOS> interesting . <EOS> any other thoughts come to mind ? <EOS> i wanna know how our product would fare . <EOS> i can't just leave it there . <EOS> i think it would take extensive marketing , <EOS> okay , <EOS> an apple with a red button on top , even i am sceptical . <EOS> but you know the whole <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i understand . yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah ? <EOS> okay <EOS> and uh i'll see you again uh when the computer tells us to . <EOS> alright . <EOS> yes . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , you're di dismissed . <EOS> not yet . <EOS> okay . <EOS>
and one day you'll be able to getical genetically modify them and they will come in pink . <EOS> ah . <EOS> okay ? <EOS> excellent , <EOS> and what's your what's your role within the team ? <EOS> mm . <EOS> i am the um <EOS> i need my notebook , <EOS> mm ooh <EOS> top banana . <EOS> thank you . <EOS> okay , cool , <EOS> i am the marketing expert <EOS> um so like <EOS>
exactly . exactly . <EOS> i was thinking though that instead of having something uh like patterned , you know , so , you know , something similar to a summer dress . you know , it would have like fruit and veg , is that we actually make these spongy . <EOS> they could be ini <EOS> initially i thought we could start with kind of um fruit that would suit kind of uh a long uh hand-held , so banana , pineapple and pear . <EOS> um it could actually the sleeve could take up a lot of the development <EOS> and the remote control , we'd just need to get reductionist on it . <EOS> they could be interchangeable , <EOS> they're spongy , <EOS> that goes back to ergonomic , <EOS> and the youngsters love 'em , <EOS> fun for the whole family , everyone can have their own . <EOS> so what we're talking about is changing . this concept . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so if we go for the simple push button , so effectively we're going for the simple printed circuit board are we ? <EOS> or are we going for the regular ? <EOS> um if it's just the push button then it just needs the simple circuit board . <EOS>
excellent . <EOS> and i still have to do my minutes for the last meeting . <EOS> actually . <EOS> um so there will probably be another questionnaire coming up . <EOS> we might have a while though . <EOS> and then we'll have to check with the main boss whether we can , what goes on after that . <EOS> but that's the end of our meeting . <EOS>
t i s should said right . <EOS> because yeah . right top . <EOS> yeah , right . <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah definitely . <EOS> um then you could put a screen , like on a mobile phone , also on top i guess . <EOS> mm-hmm . yeah but if you are using the the normal functions , the the basic functions , you normally press them on the u yeah . <EOS>
user interface design d industrial design ? <EOS> hmm . <EOS> i mean , you have to know . ah , you have to know it . <EOS> it's difficult . <EOS> it's your job , <EOS> so i hope you you know what it is . <EOS> you know very soon . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> that's just off the top of my head . <EOS> and maybe fun . <EOS> um after the meeting we're gonna each complete a sks um a questionnaire and a summaries summary . <EOS> i don't know what summarisation . <EOS> um and then we'll have our lunch break . <EOS> after that we have thirty minutes of individual work . <EOS> um i'll make sure to put up um the minutes and the project documentation and including these powerpoint slides . <EOS> if everyone could do that as well , that'd be great . <EOS> um you each have individual actions , <EOS> i_ um i_d_ industrial design you've your components concept , <EOS> user interface , the user interface concept , <EOS> market trend wa watching . <EOS> and as as per last time you'll get specific incrat instructions from your personal coach e-mailed to you . <EOS> and hopefully , i hope , next time you'll be able to access more of the web site <EOS> that they they seem to tell you that you could . <EOS>
it's a very bloody cat . <EOS> it's a frog . <EOS> no , <EOS> it's a turtle . <EOS> uh it's an apple . <EOS> it's not an apple . <EOS> must be a dog . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> a dog ? <EOS> hmm . colour . <EOS> something like this . <EOS> smaller . <EOS>
designer . <EOS> designer that uh looks would be very important on this new remote <EOS> and um it is to send messages of course to the t_v_ . <EOS> it should have nine channel buttons , a next button , volume buttons , subtitle buttons , switch to control features , colour contrast , sharpness etcetera . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> yeah , definitely . <EOS> 'kay nex r ready ? <EOS> yeah , that's it . <EOS> 'kay , any p 'kay ? <EOS> mm 'kay . <EOS> anything you wanna add for personal preferences though , <EOS> you f you said already that we needed a large on-off button , you think . <EOS> anything else ? <EOS>
mm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> some lightning stuff too <EOS> because most people find also hard to to find the remote control . <EOS> losed lose it etcetera . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> these these are <EOS> these two points are the main frustrations <EOS> so maybe if we design something very simple and easy to uh find when lost it will uh add uh a serious competitive advantage <EOS> without making something too complex and too long to develop . <EOS>
of our faces . <EOS> and <EOS> indeed . <EOS> so they can see our faces . <EOS> okay . <EOS> welcome at the kick-off meeting . <EOS> my name is uh danny wolfs . <EOS> uh this is the agenda for today . <EOS> uh first a little opening . <EOS> uh i will introduce myself , <EOS> uh and uh i think it's very uh good to introduce uh yourself . <EOS> uh then uh a little bit of acquaintance , acquaintance to uh to to ourselves . <EOS> so uh we get to know each other . <EOS> uh that will be done uh with a tool training from the he these two uh smart boards . <EOS> then the project plan . <EOS> what we're going to do , <EOS> and how we're going to do it . <EOS> uh and discussion about that and a little closing at the end . <EOS>
would you like to uh <EOS> right . <EOS> pretty impressive . <EOS> well done . <EOS> kind of a banana . <EOS> and whether or not it would fall into the cost everything i suppose . <EOS> with the scroll and the l_c_d_ . <EOS> well luckily we are going to find out . <EOS>
okay um <EOS> the case , what does it mean by single and double , do you know ? <EOS> um i think single would just be sort of one sort of oval whereas double is this sort of thing . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so we want double-curved ? <EOS> okay . <EOS>
it's a cool idea but <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , i'm happy with that . <EOS> completely . <EOS> hu yeah . <EOS> okay so are we gonna have just some kind of a like we'll have the buzzer on the som like on the t_v_ itself . <EOS> well you would have to have a button on a t_v_ or on your wall or some place since the t_v_ already has power . <EOS> yeah you click the button , it's gonna send out a signal , <EOS> and i was thinking , i_r_ is line of sight , so unless the remote is like actually in front of the t_v_ it's not gonna work , <EOS> um so probably like a radio signal like on a on a cell phone . <EOS> sends out a signal and then the the remote hears the signal and so it beeps probably . <EOS>
and see what was okay or not for them . <EOS> okay . <EOS> so then it's some statistics about what we observed and what they answered . <EOS> mm-hmm . um actually seventy five percent of the users find m the most remote controls uh ugly , <EOS> okay , <EOS> so that's <EOS>
yeah i put it down as one point four for some reason . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> oh dear , <EOS> okay . sorry . <EOS> one point four , one point five . okay right <EOS> that's i have two of them . <EOS> mine has all kinds of problems . <EOS>
uh okay , 'kay . <EOS> so are <EOS> so we need to <EOS> yeah , we need to have a fairly defined group that that we want to focus on <EOS> and then look at the functions um of the dem remote control itself . <EOS> okay . <EOS> so with that i think it's best if i hand over to you . <EOS> does anyone have a preference for going first ? <EOS>
mm-hmm , yeah <EOS> or some sort of voice <EOS> yeah , i suppose that's true . <EOS> well i suppo uh you could y you could have the <EOS> you could have the basically um instead of a whistle if it's got the voice recognition you could have it just , you know , where are you ? . <EOS>
i actually didn't do that at all though , <EOS> every single one i a all the presentations i either added slides <EOS> or edited 'em . <EOS> i di <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> oh <EOS> i added like five slides too , <EOS> but i <EOS> see <EOS> i only got blank ones . <EOS>
if you can uh flip . <EOS> yeah ? that that you can press it and then it comes up ? or <EOS> uh so you have a the the side view . <EOS> yeah . something like that . <EOS> but then the side view can be straight . if you have a pop-up screen . <EOS> but i dunno if that's too expensive . <EOS> i mean maybe it's too much <EOS>
and i think this is another thing that's interesting is the consumers actually willing to pay the price for exciting tel technology . <EOS> so even if we have a product that may be more expensive , if it comes out right , if they look it looks and feels good and has technology . <EOS> the second two , you can see the last one is a very easy simple design . <EOS> the second one , there is about uh forty-five thousand different buttons on it , which makes it fairly hard to read , uh very hard to use . <EOS> the first one , i see that they put in a display . <EOS>
right . <EOS> that's right . <EOS> yeah <EOS> it just might be frustrating where you can't make it go as fast as you want , <EOS> but i think once people get used to it <EOS> i i do like the idea of the scroll wheel though . <EOS> other than click click click . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> and if we're marketing it as a high niche product , then we're gonna be selling it to people who are buying good t_v_s as well , yeah , presumably . <EOS>
that's true . <EOS> well , we can make the the signal strong enough to go through walls if if you fancy it . <EOS> i didn't think about that <EOS> how about bluetooth ? <EOS> but <EOS> instead of using infra-red , use bluetooth . <EOS> why not ? <EOS>
i don't i don't i don't understand what what they mean by satisfaction um and for and for example . <EOS> should it be more like um like a status of of the these meetings in fact . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah well in fact uh we we use a little bit the white board and the digital pen , not that much . <EOS>
uh-huh . <EOS> uh-huh . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> beep beep beep . <EOS> can be made for <EOS> it sounded different that time <EOS> uh can be made for a similar price to uh an l_c_ display , <EOS> uh an uh <EOS> oh , sorry . <EOS>
no . <EOS> mm yep . <EOS> right . <EOS> that's what i was trying to work out . <EOS> but um it is a kinda sleeker look if you've got curves in there . <EOS> oh right . <EOS> shall we <EOS> s so do you wanna go for curves , more curves ? <EOS> we're meant to be f we're meant to be finishing this meeting in about a minute or so . <EOS>
so <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yes . <EOS> the cat is going to eat the fish or the rat ? <EOS> with different pen widths . <EOS> mm-hmm <EOS> so <EOS> oh , <EOS> it's a shark now . <EOS> ah <EOS> it's a shark , <EOS> yeah . <EOS> oh , <EOS> yes , why not ? <EOS> good idea . <EOS>
yeah i guess so . <EOS> oh <EOS> right . <EOS> trade you . <EOS> go . <EOS> now <EOS> i was sent a couple of things to modify our uh new requirements . <EOS> um the remote's only gonna be for the television , <EOS> which is good <EOS> because we already decided <EOS> y your your research showed that uh not only is a universal remote more complicated , it's more cost , more costly . <EOS> and your re uh research showed that you know most of the people don't even use it . <EOS> i think uh you said fifty percent of the people only use half the or ten percent of the buttons . <EOS> so if we remove the universal remote then that solves that problem . <EOS> um no teletext . um <EOS>
oh . <EOS> maybe the holder , if we were to have a holder , it could be shaped like a fruit . <EOS> could be , <EOS> it could be an ape or a fruit bowl . <EOS> hey we could have a variety of options here . <EOS> nice . <EOS> could look like a fruit bowl . <EOS>
yeah , yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> it's also different . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay . no , colours are clear , <EOS> shape is clear , <EOS> material is clear . <EOS> everybody think they can can <EOS> okay , <EOS> what's the standard colour ? <EOS>
or three , <EOS> because of one on each side and one on top . <EOS> i mean it's fine 'cause it comes out the same as twenty nine . <EOS> well less than twenty nine even . <EOS> okay , fine . yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay <EOS> and we're gonna <EOS> button supplements the buttons are no <EOS> uh okay . <EOS>
so you you count one degree , two degrees , no . <EOS> yeah , yeah , yeah . you can do it . <EOS> i don't think so . <EOS> yeah , it's a bit difficult . <EOS> i think so i think so you can do it . <EOS> i think so , you can just change . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> and you want <EOS> okay <EOS> for <EOS> coming back to one point <EOS> y you want to let the user to programming the keys ? some of them ? <EOS> two thirty five supposed to finish . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> good morning everybody . <EOS> oh , everybody is not ready . <EOS> good morning . <EOS> uh almost . <EOS> ready . <EOS> alright . <EOS> okay , let's go . <EOS> so , we're here today to to have our first kick-off meeting about uh this new project we're going to tak to talk about in a few minutes . <EOS>
and finally of course it has to be useful as a remote control <EOS> but it seems that it's not so important that it's useful as a remote control . <EOS> next slide please . <EOS> mm . <EOS> uh and now in a more uh general uh uh broad way of seeing th uh the thing . <EOS> if we look back and not uh look at only remote controls i think it's important to see that the trends are quite the same in many areas <EOS> so <EOS> currently the the trends that we see in l in l big cities like paris and milan , well , it seems that this year things should have uh a fruit and vegetable uh way of of look or feel <EOS> or <EOS> so . <EOS> and i think of course uh i it applies to everything . <EOS> that's the thing with trends . <EOS> it it can travel f from clothe to furniture same idea . <EOS> fruit and vegetable . think fruit and vegetable . <EOS> and uh if we co we compare to last year , now it has to be spongy , <EOS> yeah . <EOS> well <EOS> this so so i think uh uh i <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> and the whole thing <EOS> okay . <EOS> right . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> there's <EOS> okay . <EOS> mm 'kay . <EOS> okay , very cool . <EOS> it's not it's not quite a a face plate , <EOS> it's more like a pseudo-face plate <EOS> because it's simple enough <EOS> that in the factory it could we could very easily put a different one on it , <EOS> it locks into place such that , you know , it's pretty permanent <EOS> but at the same time , if we wanna go the other way it's just a matter of a couple of adjustments <EOS> and we could go the face plate way <EOS> if you know what i mean . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> with a keywords and yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> couple of words . <EOS> mm-hmm mm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> um . <EOS> and then we can have channel they can say , okay i want eight , <EOS> because we don't know like users have different programmes , <EOS> i mean they don't really follow same channels strict uh <EOS> so we just want channel number , <EOS> we don't want like b_b_c_ or c_n_n_ or something else <EOS> because <EOS>
yeah , <EOS> i think in the colours and in the uh the kind of material . <EOS> if if it's something like rubber made or i think it it's also going to be good . <EOS> yeah . mm . <EOS> mm . mm-hmm . <EOS> so mm-hmm . <EOS> okay , so <EOS> we will have uh next meeting in thirty minutes again . <EOS> um now you have to go straight on this individual action <EOS> which i which are for rama uh wil design , <EOS> um mark the user interface design , <EOS> and uh sammy uh the product evaluation . <EOS> uh you will work together uh on a new on on a prototype using modelling clay . <EOS>
definitely a single , <EOS> maybe a double . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> 'kay , <EOS> so shall we quickly <EOS> shall we go for single curve , just to compromise ? <EOS> we'll go for single curve , yeah . <EOS> single curve . <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay , <EOS> curved or double curved ? so it's single curved . <EOS>
yeah , that's right . <EOS> having a charger rather than putting the battery cells always . <EOS> people don't like it to have to buy the batteries when they run out . <EOS> we just make a small charger <EOS> and put it <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , yeah . <EOS>
hmm . <EOS> well , <EOS> i couldn't find a <EOS> the picture of the ipod w only linked to a web browser , <EOS> so i couldn't copy and paste it , <EOS> but it had a similar thing to this thing on the right . <EOS> it has uh scroll wheels without without a display , <EOS> but they they scroll like a computer mouse . <EOS>
yep . <EOS> yep . <EOS> yeah maybe the thumb is more comfortable . <EOS> this for the wheel and then this for the buttons ? <EOS> should have the two sides . <EOS> yeah i think it's okay for both right and left . mm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS>
like fruit . <EOS> i'm thinking fruits in my head , but that's tacky . <EOS> see i'm <EOS> yeah . <EOS> into it . <EOS> and then then we could have curved shapes , <EOS> 'cause wood or titanium , yeah , it's gonna have to be boxy and rectangular <EOS> and i think we might be moving away from that you know so um <EOS> well i'm <EOS> do we really want it in like the shape of a lemon or <EOS> no i don't think we do either . <EOS>
yeah , okay . <EOS> i think uh you also have uh remote controls with a lot of options . <EOS> but we lose about ninety percent of those options . <EOS> so i think you can uh <EOS> uh . we have to give our customers some extras . <EOS>
um two . <EOS> three . <EOS> one . <EOS> okay , <EOS> now we're gonna look at finances . <EOS> um i have an excel sheet that we're actually gonna calculate the cost um , <EOS> so let me exit out of this first . <EOS> okay um <EOS> whoa . <EOS>
don't destroy my giraffe . <EOS> giraffe's gone now . <EOS> okay um <EOS> the case was is made from rubber , i suppose . <EOS> there's one of the <EOS> because when you use a remote control a lot of people uh will uh will uh drop their remote control <EOS> and they break uh <EOS> becau <EOS> the uh titanium was also an option . <EOS> but uh it's a very expensive material . <EOS> uh rubber is , i think , uh the best suitable uh material uh to use uh for our uh <EOS>
okay . <EOS> three different types of batteries . um can either use a hand dynamo , or the kinetic type ones , you know that they use in watches , or else uh a solar powered one . <EOS> okay . <EOS> um . <EOS> now , <EOS> the kinetic one , we've 'cause that's the ones where like you the movement causes it . <EOS> um the bat uh the battery for a a watch wouldn't require a lot of power , would be my one query . <EOS> is a kinetic one going to be able to supply enough power ? <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> one more thing is that i <EOS> okay . <EOS> it might be a little clumsy when when it opens up , right , <EOS> so it opens on the side . so <EOS> they <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> no , yeah , but mm but we have it nicely with the hinges here yeah . <EOS> so it won't be a problem , <EOS> it will be and it will be <EOS> it won't be heavy . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> so that's that , i guess . <EOS> we should now go away and get these things sorted out . <EOS> i guess you two are on plasticine duty or whatever . <EOS> okay , so um . <EOS> okay . <EOS> is that the end ? <EOS> okay . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i know um <EOS> my parents went out and bought um remote controls because um they got fed up of having four or five different remote controls for each things the house . <EOS> so um for them it was just how many devices control . <EOS>
there's no need to have buttons on it to do that , <EOS> maybe to do <EOS> so , <EOS> no . <EOS> it could be one button for a menu or something , if you really need to go and do that . <EOS> yep . <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
'kay . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> okay everybody . welcome to the detailed design meeting . <EOS> um <EOS> let's see . <EOS> our agenda . <EOS> last time we discussed the squishy fruitiness of our remote controls and how we might pursue that . <EOS> um and i think looks like we've come up with some ideas . <EOS> um and we also talked about materials we'd use and what kind of chip would be necessary . <EOS> um so for later in the meeting i've done a a spreadsheet of production costs <EOS> so we'll take a look at that . <EOS> um and see if it's changed at all from when we last discussed it . <EOS>
we have to find cost . <EOS> but you've gotta think who our target market is <EOS> because i i'm not our target market . <EOS> i'm a student , <EOS> but i'm just asking you . <EOS> if <EOS> on the other hand i would think , mm with my project manager salary , i would think yeah i could probably afford this uh would i buy it ? <EOS> maybe . <EOS> if i had a cool new t_v_ and this was r looking really slick and it had the dock and it had the scroll wheel , which i think's a really cool idea , that would sell me on it a little . <EOS> then maybe you know . i do i don't think i'd go over a hundred euro certainly , <EOS> that would be way too much , <EOS> but the i would be happy paying over forty for it , i guess , but not much <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> i it could even encourage healthier habits for television watchers , <EOS> you know they have uh fruits all round them . <EOS> now just make sure they don't eat the remote . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> make them make them think of fruit , yeah . <EOS>
hm . um , according to the frequency of use and the relevance of each buttons , i have made a list of the buttons that we should focus on in order of importance . <EOS> so the most important buttons are those to do with channel selection . <EOS> they're used about a hundred and sixty times per hour . <EOS> and um <EOS> yeah so and and people like to zap a lot apparently , <EOS> so this is the order . <EOS> channel selection , teletext , volume , and power . <EOS> the other ones are the settings , and they're used less than you know zero point eight to zero point five times per hour , <EOS> and this means that i think we can we could have like a a button for all the settings , <EOS> and then , just one , <EOS> and then from there go on to the audio on the screen , either on the remote or on the television . <EOS> um , <EOS> about the screen , and speech recognition , some people are more willing than others to actually pay for that . <EOS> and if we look at the market , f people from well from fifteen to thirty five year old year olds , <EOS> i don't really know how to describe this , <EOS> um ninety one to seventy six percent of people in that age range are willing to pay more for this sort of product , <EOS> while people that are above thirty five years ol um years old go from thirty five percent to eight percent , <EOS> so people that are sixty five for example wouldn't actually pay for this sort of thing . <EOS> um i don't i don't know um what the decision to be made is , <EOS> but i think that the people that actually do buy remotes m more are those like teenagers and young professionals and um , most likely , <EOS> but we should discuss this together . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> thank you very much . <EOS> thank you . <EOS> thank you . <EOS>
hmm . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> because , you know what , i'm being quite serious when i say that that um the things i mentioned are hot . <EOS> but i think the important thing might be to choose one . <EOS> you know , if if what you're telling me is is um some of these things aren't just f aren't feasible , maybe we could something about naming , <EOS> we could call it , you know , blackberry . <EOS>
hmm . <EOS> i wonder if they mean like literally make it , sort of buttons and everything . <EOS> so sh should <EOS> no . <EOS> oh yeah , we can do buttons . <EOS> should we leave now , brian ? <EOS> or we are going to discuss something ? <EOS>
it's it's a kind of setting , i think . <EOS> it should fit in those settings functions . <EOS> because it's not a very current useful function . <EOS> mm . <EOS> settings . <EOS> uh , well i think when they say power button they mean to turn the t_v_ on and off . <EOS>
yeah that's right . <EOS> yeah but <EOS> alright . <EOS> and the next is celebration . <EOS> so . <EOS> so <EOS> so uh coffee machine . <EOS> okay . <EOS> alright then , we finished ? <EOS> yeah free free coffee . <EOS> yeah thank you for your work and <EOS>
couple innovative ideas . <EOS> mm . <EOS> no . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> not every idea necessarily , <EOS> it's still a remote control . <EOS> uh no <EOS> yeah but we did we did break with the specs a little bit i guess , <EOS> but the uh <EOS>
i figured with the spam thing , if you can't beat it , join in . <EOS> that's the kind of spam that everybody likes to receive . <EOS> mm 'kay . <EOS> are you ready ? <EOS> okay , right , well , <EOS> i take it that you are all ready now . <EOS> um alright first off we'll just uh recap from our last meeting . <EOS> um which was we got together just to basically decide on well to talk about what it is that we were actually uh supposed to be doing , <EOS> and who we all are and stuff like that , <EOS> mm get bit more of an idea together of what's going on . <EOS>
mm . right . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> well <EOS> in the publicity of a face plate on a phone is you have it out and around , <EOS> it is sort of emblematic <EOS> whereas you're just sit at home , <EOS> so unless somebody comes over to watch t_v_ <EOS>
it's using speech recognition , yeah . <EOS> okay yeah . <EOS> well . <EOS> gi given that that it works , <EOS> then it's i think one . <EOS> give it a one ? <EOS> yep . <EOS> yeah , one , yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> ease of use ? <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> i think it would be a b <EOS> because it's many buttons and we were speaking about lowering the number . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> on the other side we have more and more channels , and if you want to pass through all the channels to get the channel you want , it's <EOS>
is it zero franc ? <EOS> a special colour ? <EOS> uh special colour , now we leave it to the covers . <EOS> uh <EOS> so <EOS> now we're either going button or l_c_d_s , l_c_d_ display . <EOS> push . <EOS> mm , yes , <EOS> but <EOS> l_c_d_ is . <EOS> it's okay . just say l_c_d_ . <EOS>
yeah , think that's a good idea . <EOS> uh . that sounds pretty good , yeah . <EOS> no . <EOS> is the <EOS> uh you know , <EOS> we we we are really going for the ultimate in ex uh external simplicity here . <EOS> um you know , <EOS> cut cost within the <EOS>
because it's too expensive . <EOS> yeah , probably . <EOS> yeah , only only for television uh <EOS> on the market you can now buy for twenty euros a remote control for everything . <EOS> and we only make it for television , <EOS> so we mi mm we m must made it make it uh very special . <EOS>
sharpness . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> okay what about uh sound settings <EOS> ? uh d can you change any of those at all ? <EOS> audio . <EOS> audio , we have like your basic y your base , your mid-range , your high range . <EOS> um . <EOS> the the balance hmm . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> but , but also it seems that <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> i mean there are markets and markets . <EOS> i think the young people are th uh are uh <EOS> christine here said uh you have a <EOS> uh it is yeah . <EOS> so for our young people uh it will be cool , they can be able to use it . <EOS> th maybe their parents will not but they will configure it . <EOS> i guess . <EOS> i don't know if there is study about that . <EOS>
yeah , yeah <EOS> because it's n uh it's not like a big one with uh one hundred buttons or so , <EOS> three ? okay . <EOS> yeah <EOS> it's a <EOS> actually the user has to put some effort to do use that actually , <EOS> it's not so easy , like this one the normal . <EOS>
one is a communication . <EOS> for men . <EOS> to the in <EOS> okay . <EOS> and , that's it . <EOS> i think we should use a f_p_g_a_ for for the functionalities which is easy to to t <EOS> mm . <EOS> what is f_p_g_a_ ? <EOS> it's field programmable uh something array . <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
yeah <EOS> you can tell what room the mobile is <EOS> what about what if the the volume on the t_v_'s turned up massively and uh you just wanna turn down the volume can't find remote . <EOS> bu <EOS> suppose you have to go to the t_v_ and do it manually . mm . <EOS>
per unit , i guess . <EOS> y oh okay . <EOS> yeah , of course . <EOS> um , so we can start today to have a first idea of what we want to do what are our experiments with remote control , and any idea ? <EOS> so , if you have some experience , good or bad , with remote controls you can share it and say what you f what is your idea . <EOS> anything . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> mm-mm . <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah that makes sense , <EOS> so we'd stick with the simple circuit board <EOS> and then think of the speech recognition as an extra an extra possibility . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> just as a fun way to find it . <EOS>
uh about this . mm-hmm . so basically um <EOS> there's a breakdown of how much they use the different functions on a rem remote control . <EOS> um , power and volume selection are only used a few times within this uh per hour . <EOS> um , channel selection is used a hundred and sixty eight times um <EOS> and then there's things like channel settings , audio settings , which are only used very infrequently . <EOS> um . teletext is used um fourteen times in the hour , <EOS> so it is used but not nearly as much as the channel selection is used . um . <EOS>
right . <EOS> i'm manuel <EOS> and i'm the industrial designer in in this project um . <EOS> in the functional design phase i'm i'll be dealing mostly with the requirements , <EOS> um we'll discuss what the prog what functions the the product has to fulfil and so and so on . <EOS> um i suppose we'll work pretty much together on that one . <EOS> um um in the conceptual design um i'll be pro mostly dealing with properties and materials um of our product . <EOS> and uh the detailed design in the detailed design i'll be concerned with the look and feel of the product itself , <EOS> um so we're pretty much working together obviously on the design front here . okay . <EOS>
group of users , or <EOS> because it says below forty i mean . <EOS> i guess that's that's the tar yeah uh or male and female <EOS> yeah users . <EOS> yeah so i think it's easy but <EOS> but uh it's it's also for children or just uh <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> we well <EOS> we can still look at <EOS> we can talk with the coffee unit <EOS> and you can uh check how much how much they <EOS> yeah yeah <EOS> yeah . <EOS> we exactly yeah <EOS> i if if it's a low vocabulary it's already implemented , <EOS> and w how much it's cost , maybe with a f cheap chip . <EOS>
this is a difficult one , because we we don't yeah , we don't know it about the <EOS> yeah , we shall test it <EOS> but uh <EOS> uh it's it's very easy to use , but uh the second layer is not easy to use . <EOS> it's that's <EOS>
mm . <EOS> aye that's a good idea , yeah . <EOS> and possibility . <EOS> right and these are problems i've had with it . <EOS> um i don't know where the slogan should go , <EOS> or really what the slogan is . <EOS> i think it's um , fashion into electronics . <EOS> and we don't know how flexible the colour scheme is . <EOS> i mean you say you wanted the the corporate colours , <EOS> but they don't say you know if we can use any other colours at all or <EOS>
. <EOS> hello . <EOS> 'kay . <EOS> you all saw the newsflash ? <EOS> or you got the same message ? <EOS> it's <EOS> yeah i i just saw it one minute ago . <EOS> when i uh <EOS> yeah sorry . <EOS> i don't know . <EOS> i didn't see it yet i think . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> less chance of it being lost too , <EOS> it's not like a chocolate brown lozenge that's gonna go down the sofa <EOS> and people might want to put it on their mantelpiece or whatever as a ki if it looks attractive enough as a kind of ornament <EOS> they don't not gonna lose it so much either . <EOS> it's easier to bit nice to handle . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> 'kay . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> hmm hmm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so i'll be coming to you um frequently as the industrial expert to tell me how hard it's gonna be to add a feature or how expensive it's gonna be or if your time , if it takes five years to develop this it's just something we can't do . <EOS> so in the beginning just have a big puddle of things that we anybody can th throw anything in <EOS> and then just weed things out that can't be done for one reason or another , <EOS> and then the things that seem the most attractive that to uh to a customer we'll try to then prioritise those . <EOS> so that was um what i meant there , <EOS> and as i said on the slide there consulting the industrial engineer about that <EOS>
yeah that is true . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> we would have to look carefully into the design though . <EOS> costs . <EOS> 'cause we would have to make one w uh control which would fit in with a wooden cover and a plastic cover . the more original one , or the more standard one . <EOS>
yeah , that's right . <EOS> but it <EOS> everywhere in the r <EOS> but does it make any difference for the energy you use ? <EOS> you got still one led . <EOS> no i don't think so , <EOS> but <EOS> yeah , <EOS> i it it will look different , <EOS> and i think we need to find something else . <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
yeah . but it's for the next team . <EOS> we don't have to do that . <EOS> yeah , but it you can't possibly do that in such a short time , i think . <EOS> that's for . <EOS> yeah , this this is just the idea phase , <EOS> the <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> well it was yellow . <EOS> um . <EOS> yeah , the company strategy , okay . <EOS> um there was lot of discussing , that was good . <EOS> um i feel i got my say . <EOS> um so i'd give the company strategy a two . <EOS>
mm . yeah . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> you can start it you know . <EOS> yes , <EOS> a good idea mael . <EOS> i think for us it's just like a normal whiteboard , <EOS> but they'll be recording what we write down . <EOS> so , <EOS> i <EOS>
well <EOS> i think i find a lot of them really complicated to use with all the different buttons <EOS> and uh it's handiest when you have one that works both the d_v_d_ player or whatever and the t_v_ as well . <EOS> um , but that it's easy to if you can switch back and forth instead of having to press a bunch of different buttons <EOS> and <EOS> so i think it's is best when they're clearly labelled <EOS> and you can see which buttons you're supposed to use , <EOS> you know . <EOS>
uh . <EOS> yeah , that's the only thing though . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so then basically it has to have some way to get to get to a mode on the television where you're doing , um <EOS> mm . <EOS> you can get to you know , you can <EOS> like maybe it'll be that central button <EOS> that , like , then you hit that and then you can it brings up like the menu on the t_v_ <EOS> and you can just scroll around , like , to do the timer , to do the <EOS> yeah , yeah . <EOS>
of course yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> we will use uh infrared protocol uh using yeah infrared <EOS> and uh <EOS> and of course we need to adapt to that protocol that already exists <EOS> and <EOS> but we what we can do is uh uh adapting the the chips inside uh to the best uh chips and uh infrared bubbles . <EOS>
yeah <EOS> yeah . <EOS> uh uh uh <EOS> okay , <EOS> if we if we're going down that route , then we need some sort of display . <EOS> do we need some sort of display ? <EOS> we actually use the television , okay . okay , okay , okay . <EOS>
yep . <EOS> check here . <EOS> yeah , got small writing . <EOS> yeah i've been using up the pages . <EOS> i don't wanna waste it . <EOS> i've finished the meeting now . <EOS> another questionnaire . <EOS> oh , everybody needs k questionnaire . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> uh working components . <EOS> oh , you didn't get that . <EOS> i will send new . <EOS> uh i'll put it in shared documents , again . <EOS> no . <EOS> okay , thank you . <EOS> um yeah , project , project documents . <EOS>
like how often do you hit nine ? <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> it's just people are used to seeing that , <EOS> so if we didn't have them then they might think it's <EOS> but , <EOS> well possibly <EOS> but the the other thing is that with um the current expansion of uh channels uh in the process of taking place , certainly the button up and down , <EOS> but uh i mean how many channels do we have to um actual television channels do we have to uh prepare for ? <EOS> i would have thought that uh it's forever expanding <EOS> and at the moment we've got although you've onl you've got the five standard , you've got the b_b_c_ have come up with a further six <EOS> and uh there's uh i don't know exactly how many channels there are on uh when you take into account uh sky and various other um various others . <EOS> so i would've thought that we wouldn't , you know , rather <EOS> okay , if the time of flicking from one to other , <EOS> but presumably it'll take a second <EOS> 'cause you have to be able to stop it . <EOS> maybe you could have a fast forward on the on the channels <EOS> that w <EOS> and then you could dispense with more otherwise . <EOS> y you'd want you'd want to get fairly quickly to the channel that you wanted . <EOS>
no it's not in there because i had the computer problem and i i i cou i couldn't create it . <EOS> i couldn't create it in the powerpoint , <EOS> and i think i've got this really strange cable . <EOS> so what i had , basically going from the powerpoint format , is that <EOS> uh yeah yeah i like this a lot . <EOS>
oops . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> if you don't put it <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> that <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> it should be fine . <EOS> as long as there's not a big pause between the t hitting the two buttons . <EOS>
the touchscreen , yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> then an l_c_d_ uh would be handy . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> here are the basic functions in here , the selecting dev devices . <EOS> yeah , and touch screens for all our stuff , yeah . <EOS> i do agree with that . <EOS>
usually it's already on t_v_ or something like that . <EOS> yes . <EOS> yeah but since we want to control all the televisions , and and it would probably be worth to to set the timing on the remote , <EOS> no ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> because if if the t_v_ turns on itself , it well you know , if the time the timer should be there . <EOS>
mm , does actually , yeah , yeah . <EOS> cool . <EOS> mm different to feel , <EOS> yeah , yeah . <EOS> yeah , yeah . <EOS> and the <EOS> you know , <EOS> that that solves one of the problems of b of battery life , <EOS> 'cause that would well that would clobber the battery life , <EOS> so no , <EOS> i mean given the nature of the buttons we're having , it's actually uh uh unnecessary i think . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> so this is a television remote control ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yes , it's a television remote control . <EOS> right . <EOS> i believe i should be taking minutes on this right now . <EOS> so , alright . <EOS> okay . <EOS> um , yeah . <EOS> um , the way that we're going to go about this is , um , we'll have a time where we can , um come up with new ideas alone , and , and work on the project <EOS> and then , um , after we've brainstormed and , and thought about , we can come together in a meeting and , and discuss what , what um , what kind of functional design we want to use . <EOS> same with conceptual design and detailed design . <EOS> so , um , <EOS> making sure that it , it's usable , <EOS> that as a , um <EOS> and that it's , it's feasible to create , <EOS> and uh , to come up with a concept of it want , what we want it to look like . <EOS> um , tool training . <EOS> is , is everyone , um <EOS> okay . <EOS> great . great . <EOS> um <EOS>
um so we're gonna try out our white board . <EOS> if we'll all draw our favourite animal , to sum up the characteristics of that animal . <EOS> so you want us to draw it and then talk about it ? or just draw it ? <EOS> okay . <EOS>
our marketing expert uh gave us some i uh information from interviews with a hundred different remote users . <EOS> um with some statistics that backed basically what we were thinking before . <EOS> people thought their remotes were ugly , um <EOS> um <EOS> that remotes zap a lot . <EOS> um they only use uh a finite amount of buttons . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> in here and then we can discuss it with the next uh in the project uh <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> we could just start with the assumption that's only for t_v_ and video . <EOS> and um reserve the possibility to add other features . <EOS> so we have a basic starting point <EOS> and you can always extend that <EOS> so make sure it's extendible . yeah . <EOS>
yeah . okay . <EOS> yeah . okay . <EOS> our animals will forever be there . <EOS> un unless you feel you need it t to <EOS> okay okay . <EOS> we'll <EOS> i don't feel any <EOS> right um <EOS> right so one point one ? <EOS> we'll just go in a circle . <EOS>
okay , that's all . <EOS> oh , but you have a catch there , <EOS> um assume that um if you want to go to if you are watching channel two and if you want to go to channel ninety nine , then . <EOS> well , then y you you go to the main menu <EOS> and uh you have uh go to channel <EOS> and then uh you can <EOS>
well , we're gonna go with i think we've decided that it's gonna be a rubber case so <EOS> yeah , but is it a double curved one or not ? <EOS> if it's not a double curved , then we've got the choice for the push-buttons , <EOS> if it's a double curve , we've gotta go for rubber push-buttons . <EOS> if that makes sense . <EOS>
i think we should um <EOS> this is one of the modern remote controls of the moment . <EOS> i think we should go more to the ipod and m_p_ three players . mobile phones . <EOS> more modern . y yes . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> just modern modern but still uh basic . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> together ? <EOS> yeah , it's let's do it together . <EOS> okay . <EOS> i'll give comments . <EOS> yeah , we just made a word file with the basic elements . <EOS> uh the look-and-feel model . <EOS> uh well the form , the case um as drawn there . <EOS> simply a square with uh round corners . <EOS> so that's basically it . <EOS> uh the material should be hard plastic . <EOS>
i dunno . <EOS> just normal discussion , i think . not <EOS> yeah . <EOS> one leader or something . <EOS> one leader to check the time , etcetera . <EOS> yeah . and make notes . <EOS> yeah , i know . <EOS> so more like a secretary . <EOS>
yeah i think they're actually trying to find ideas for a ideal remote . <EOS> they're using our ideas . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , two years' time this will be on the market . <EOS> ex exactly that product <EOS> um thum <EOS> we'll go , yeah , we designed that and no-one will believe us . <EOS> but um <EOS>
shapes . <EOS> yeah okay , <EOS> but then we have to think of something totally new . <EOS> not in depth . <EOS> yeah , but yeah , if if we want to make it kind of , yeah , new . <EOS> i've uh i had a lot of picture of old ones . <EOS> and all curves have already been done . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> but okay , <EOS> i'm not , i'm not really sure if uh that would really appeal to everyone though , <EOS> maybe just to fashion gurus , <EOS> like maybe just like a little bit n a little fruit picture somewhere in the corner , <EOS> but i don't know about <EOS> uh i dunno how ergonomic a , an orange is . <EOS>
hmm ? <EOS> well <EOS> not main documents this time . <EOS> oh uh yes . <EOS> i have it open myself i guess . <EOS> um well <EOS> the detailed design meeting huh ? <EOS> we're finally getting somewhere hopefully . <EOS> um what are we going to do ? <EOS> i've opened it already . <EOS> um i'm still going to take some minutes , <EOS> and if i'm right , you two are going to give a prototype presentation ? <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> so <EOS> that's possible . <EOS> uh but with three d_ uh curved uh remote controls , we must use rubber buttons . <EOS> so we can't use the flat buttons . <EOS> mm . so <EOS> we need uh two d_ . <EOS> yeah , i think . <EOS>
but not with rabbits . <EOS> not with rabbits , no no . <EOS> and vets , i like vets as well . <EOS> and yeah um and i like cocktails , especially pink ones . <EOS> okay ? <EOS> cool . <EOS> mm . <EOS> cool . <EOS> excellent , <EOS> to match the rabbit . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> to you . um as you can see here . <EOS> perfect . <EOS> so <EOS> first uh just to mention i will take notes uh of this meeting <EOS> and uh i will try to work them out <EOS> and give them to you . <EOS> i've also made notes of the previous meeting <EOS> and um i was about to send them you <EOS> but then uh i had to go to this uh meeting <EOS> so you will get them too uh <EOS>
look-and-feel and <EOS> yeah . <EOS> good luck . <EOS> so i <EOS> uh make new page and uh be creative . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> alright so that's uh <EOS> yeah . <EOS> alright . <EOS> but we have to do it at this moment , after th this meeting ? <EOS>
ah . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> that's not at the moment a requirement , <EOS> it's something we're looking at , <EOS> what preference <EOS> so it may come round to market research at some point to see what people would like . <EOS> yes . yes . <EOS> and we've talked about um there being an alarm or something , a beeping for being lost , um . <EOS>
hmm . <EOS> and so <EOS> my personal preferences <EOS> i i just think we need sorta big uh energy source that won't die out , <EOS> uh perhaps some sort of rechargeable battery <EOS> or a battery dock you could place it in , <EOS> so it'd constantly be charged , <EOS> so you wouldn't have to uh be worrying about it running out of batteries and not changing channels for you . <EOS> uh a wide range uh sender-receiver , <EOS> so that you can hit the buttons from basically anywhere in the room , and the channel'll still be changed . <EOS> uh also definitely a user-friendly interface <EOS> um and i think we've all sort of mentioned adding a a locating device on it , <EOS> so when it does get stuck under the couch cushions , as they inevitably do , you can find them easily . <EOS> and that's pretty much it . <EOS>
yeah , okay , so capsicum or pepper . yeah . <EOS> uh pepper . <EOS> pepper . <EOS> but um they do d <EOS> and it's al it also suits with the double curve for easy of <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i don't know , it seems a little bit kind of bulky to me , like <EOS>
right . <EOS> and you have a mute button and then the numbers and the eject , and the power button . <EOS> so that gives you two different kinds , a more complex and more simple version . <EOS> okay . <EOS> ready . <EOS> okay . who would like to um follow that one up ? <EOS>
bigger and the base . <EOS> that just seems so clunky and <EOS> yeah . <EOS> 'kay so <EOS> yeah , <EOS> because i mean if even looking at cellphones right now , those trends the smaller the hotter it is , <EOS> yeah <EOS> smaller and smaller , yeah , yeah , yeah . <EOS>
yes , <EOS> i mean the only thing is if if you're watching television in a in a a darkened room um you need to be able to uh <EOS> mm . <EOS> i suppose . <EOS> fi find the button buttons easily . <EOS> easily , yeah yeah . <EOS>
yes . <EOS> so <EOS> we're here to design , come up with a nice product . <EOS> yeah , so <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yes uh , <EOS> but uh that that we can that we can talk about the production later , okay , depends on the the quantity , okay . <EOS> so we don't need to have our own uh fabric factory or something , <EOS> so we can have a tie-up with who the do the fabric , okay , for the different uh electronics items , <EOS> then we can have a business tie-up and to get to cut the cost , okay , to sell more . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> and our colour i think is great . <EOS> the colours are bright and warm and we really do great job there . <EOS> and given um the constraints that we had i think we got it as soft as possible . <EOS> and then functionality um i think you did a really good job on functionality , <EOS> obviously we could have ad added different functions but then we'd disturb something else <EOS> so i would say that we got to a five out of seven on on functionality . <EOS> so i think that basically we've got a great product and we can get off and running with it . <EOS>
yeah , <EOS> maybe ten <EOS> i do yeah , colours <EOS> and al shapes also . yeah . <EOS> yes , exactly . <EOS> yes . <EOS> yes . <EOS> yeah of course yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah okay , friendly shape , that would help . <EOS>
this sample sensor . <EOS> our budget's twelve point five . <EOS> uh okay . <EOS> yeah , the sample sensor will have to go , <EOS> 'cause that's the most expensive thing on there . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> so that has implications though for the . <EOS> uh it does not have for voice recognition , <EOS> but it does have for the feedback speaker . <EOS> when you say when you press one it says one or it says hello . <EOS>
w <EOS> just to to incorporate the voice activation in it is is sorta the trick . <EOS> once you've got the whole voice chip in there , then it's pretty much the the world the the sky is your limit , <EOS> but to actually the <EOS> the big step is to actually get the voice activation chips in there and working . <EOS>
cool . <EOS> i'm two . <EOS> i'm four . <EOS> alright . <EOS> excellent . <EOS> it was lovely meeting you all . <EOS> 'kay <EOS> just make sure you keep checking the company web site and the emails . <EOS> 'kay . <EOS> let me see if i can do that right now . <EOS>
ooh . <EOS> um so these are all options that the user interface guy can uh has at his disposal to put together a user interface . <EOS> okay . <EOS> for electronics , we have these very technical um descriptions here . <EOS> a simple chip , which is the least expensive , <EOS> but i have no numbers to give you , <EOS> a regular chip , which is like the medium porridge the medium expense uh <EOS>
like how much ? <EOS> uh i think uh w when the selling price is twenty five , uh uh you got two million , two million remotes . <EOS> but our marketing range is uh , market range is international . <EOS> so we have uh virtually the whole world we can sell uh <EOS>
okay . <EOS> um . <EOS> i guess in many ways everybody . <EOS> everybody who has a t_v_ . <EOS> mm , t_v_ , yeah . <EOS> t_v_ television we was . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> and i think today there are probably not many people who don't have a t_v_ . <EOS> there are a few but in general not . <EOS>
you have enough surface ? <EOS> you <EOS> yeah because now we are having rechargeable batteries <EOS> so that that is . <EOS> okay . <EOS> what will be the autonomy ? roughly ? <EOS> mm . <EOS> the what sorry ? <EOS> the autonomy . <EOS> autonomy . <EOS> what do you mean ? <EOS>
okay . <EOS> cool . <EOS>
ugh . <EOS> seems to be a fairly uh standard universal remote control . it has fast-forward , stop , play , all relating to movies . <EOS> it also has seems to have channel up and channel down , <EOS> which is which is more what you'd expect from a , you know , like a sky or cable remote control <EOS> where you've got hundreds of channels instead of a merely terrestrial one . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> we are actu we are the <EOS> flashy . <EOS> okay . <EOS> well i think we do <EOS> if it's really uh , if you can if you can get the ipod look , then it's beautiful , i think . <EOS> yes . <EOS> and and what ki what kind of what kind of basic colours uh were you thought uh of ? <EOS> the basic colours are black or green or yellow ? <EOS> or you haven't thought about <EOS>
okay . <EOS> i don't mind . <EOS> i dunno . <EOS> um . <EOS> ah uh . <EOS> let's see . <EOS> good job i got pockets today . <EOS> your microphone's just <EOS> but now you you uh you'll move out from the microphone and the camera . <EOS> i take it that <EOS>
distinction . yeah . <EOS> yeah , and the and the rubber , it it will look cheap always , <EOS> you know , with the <EOS> yeah . <EOS> the colour <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay but the the colours , you you can make it uh make the colours with leds uh beneath the the buttons . <EOS> if you press a button and you can disable the the colour leds for for people that don't like it . <EOS>
hmm . <EOS> um and a couple of other th maybe comp uh consolidate some of the usage an and see what we can do with that . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> y um al always bearing in mind that right now we are of course well within the budget <EOS> and that we still you know we probably can't , with this particular item , we probably can't just uh add a whole lot of more things . <EOS> uh um we need uh you know we need to leave space money-wise for the voice recogniser . <EOS>
yeah but should be comfortable . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i mean how do how do <EOS> i'm not really <EOS> like when i use an ipod , i end up just kind of using my index finger to like control it . so <EOS>
mm hmm hmm hmm . <EOS> yeah <EOS> mm . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah <EOS> the i the idea the the conceptual idea is that simplicity and powerful . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> simplicity meaning that we have few buttons , <EOS> powerful is that all the controls with the one you saw we saw earlier in the meetings with lots of buttons n <EOS> but here you only have few buttons <EOS> but you retain the mm the same powerful functionalities . <EOS> but in addition with simplicity . <EOS> so that's the best idea , <EOS> the cond that <EOS> that's our uh an innovation um uh i in this uh design here . <EOS> okay now we come to other important features that i did not tell you . <EOS> the first one is the speech recogniser , <EOS> again it's detachable or add-on . <EOS> and then we also have security feature <EOS> for example this here oop <EOS> it's very robust , <EOS> it doesn't break <EOS> and the material , what's the material again ? <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> often lost s was that , <EOS> yeah . <EOS> lost , yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> but if we add speech recognition as well as glow in the dark then both these factors will help their locating the remote control , <EOS> like if they come and speak something at the remote control uh replies to something something and it glows in the dark . <EOS> both these factors uh both these points will help them to locate the where they have kept this remote control , <EOS> and this will definitely enhance our uh market sales , <EOS> so we should take it into consideration also . <EOS>
um . maybe um <EOS> why <EOS> uh anna can you c do you have a presentations ? <EOS> you don't have presentation ? <EOS> no , i don't . <EOS> i wasn't . no . <EOS> uh you want a table to to uh <EOS> i c i can talk about it <EOS> but i have no slides or anything . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> um right , okay . <EOS> let me just scoot on ahead here . <EOS> okay . <EOS> um well d does anybody have anything to add to uh to the finance issue at all ? <EOS> do we have any other background information on like how that compares to other <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah <EOS> and the use of the rubber . <EOS> use of the rubber , the use of the l_e_d_ . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> for the anti-r_s_i_ . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> the l_e_d_ use isn't particularly innovative <EOS> and we don't have any scroll buttons , it's all pushbuttons , <EOS> there's no l_c_d_ control , <EOS> so if we're thinking about the rest of the market , it's sort of probably halfway . <EOS> in some aspects it is , like we said . <EOS>
mm 'kay . <EOS> do we have any ballpark figures for that yet ? no . <EOS> uh i don't have any figures right now . <EOS> we uh we have to wait until we get to a more specific design phase for that . <EOS> um but and i think a significant part of the cost could be the actual the actual casing itself and and you know the the b the buttons and things like that , i think . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> uh th most of them ar <EOS> i don't know <EOS> we're have to come up with a new idea on how to make it a lot easier to use , <EOS> 'cause a lot of times uh spend uh half a day through the instruction book trying to figure out how to use it . <EOS>
yes , that's true . yeah . <EOS> so uh , you know , <EOS> but that's okay . <EOS> that's why we're all here at the table , <EOS> so that if we think of it and our research indicates certain things and um w we it's complementary . <EOS>
you said seven ? <EOS> 'cause it's five five seven seven so <EOS> okay . <EOS> uh , okay , definitely easy to use . <EOS> definitely seven . <EOS> seven . <EOS> seven . <EOS> seven . <EOS> and you ? <EOS> five . <EOS> outl you are not lik outlier . <EOS> seven <EOS>
alright . <EOS> let's remember that . <EOS> um so raj told us that uh consumers are willing to spend more for fancy products , <EOS> and um he also mentioned that uh the current products don't always match users' operating behaviour . <EOS> um , a lot of the buttons aren't used , <EOS> and uh <EOS> he mentioned that they're not fun to use . <EOS> and uh a novel feature which uh we just brought up was this this automatic speech recognition feature or noise detection feature for when you lose the remote , <EOS> there could be a little microphone on it , <EOS> and any noise over a certain threshold um it'll pick up as a a distress signal um from you and it'll beep back and say you know oh here i am or something of this sort . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> okay . let's move on . <EOS> uh uh <EOS> yeah . <EOS> before before st before ending the meeting i'd like to to draw some sketch about the pro future prot prototype . <EOS> go for it . <EOS> and uh going to the last slide . <EOS>
you mean the loo the look , the outside ? <EOS> okay . <EOS> the look , how it look like . yeah , the the look is is bad for them <EOS> so uh <EOS> it's your job , david , maybe . <EOS> then eighty percent of users would spend more money um actually if if the remote controls were not so ugly . <EOS> so this is where we could have uh yeah , good market , i guess , if people are ready to pay more . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> right . well <EOS> when the majority of people are only using the most primary functions on a daily basis , <EOS> although i'm not saying we should completely rule out major functions , <EOS> they should be secondary , at least if not functionally then visually , <EOS> like those shouldn't be <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . mm-hmm . <EOS> can he programme his remote control or is it basic with that too ? <EOS> right . <EOS> i don't think they tape things , <EOS> i don't think they use <EOS> yeah , my grandad's actually better than me at using teletext , so <EOS> .
ah . <EOS> covers or something so . <EOS> anyway those are <EOS> that's all i have , <EOS> but uh hopefully we can we can revisit those ideas when we get into <EOS> uh craig do you wanna <EOS> yep . <EOS> uh plug yours in then ? <EOS> is it working ? <EOS>
so speech recognition is most important as far as you're concerned ? <EOS> yeah , but w <EOS> this could be uh one feature which could be sellable . <EOS> yeah h that could that could that could be our star feature . <EOS> that that be really good , yeah , i agree with that . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> yes yes . <EOS> maybe we could think of the the cases like changing with the fashions <EOS> like the nokia phones where you could take the casing off the outside . <EOS> but whether that would be too much to incorporate in production , <EOS> whether that would just increase the costs , <EOS> make it more complicated . <EOS>
um generally , generally uh this remote control uh uh should be should be something , in my opinion , uh the first feature is just to be easy to use . <EOS> so , the more frequent buttons should be larger , <EOS> they should be placed in a good position uh uh inside the remote control . <EOS> and uh s uh i can conclude like this , that we shouldn't need to learn how to use it . <EOS> it should be <EOS> we shouldn't need to es open a a t book and uh start reading and uh learning how to use this uh this uh remote control . <EOS> okay . so what i found out that uh as i said uh i think it's better to put uh more frequent uh uh uh ke uh buttons which are used more in the middle of the remote control , and they should be bigger in size . <EOS> uh the shape of remote control should be in a way which can which should be taken easily in hand . <EOS> it should not be completely like uh a cube . <EOS> it should be it should have round edge , so uh then it's easier . <EOS> and maybe uh just like some toys , some joystick which is easier to take inside the hand . <EOS> and uh also f uh uh m because because customers doesn't like to buy lots of battery , it should not uh consume lots of energy . <EOS>
my name , my job . <EOS> questionnaire with seven point scale from one to seven , from true to false , <EOS> like question , is remote big enough , we can say it's true or it's false by steps . <EOS> right . <EOS> one means absolutely not true , <EOS> seven means true . <EOS>
for each person , yeah . <EOS> 'kay , we can <EOS> so there are <EOS> so we have three <EOS> f yeah . <EOS> we have functional design , conceptual design , and detail design . <EOS> so there are three kinds of designs , that's all . <EOS> okay , alright . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> okay and if we go to the next slide , <EOS> here you can find these are the latest fashion updates , <EOS> and so this in paris and milan they have detected this trends that the this year it's going to be an year of fruit and vegetable , <EOS> so people are really interested to see if they have an remote in the shape of the fruit or a vegetable , or whatever they like . <EOS>
so , <EOS> let's go back to what the basic function of a remote control is . <EOS> it's for sending a message , um typically um via infrared . <EOS> and the the basic components we've got to build in for our twelve euros fifty are um an energy source , the user interface <EOS> and <EOS> which will um in incorporate um an integrated circuit <EOS> that actually composes the message um based on what the which buttons the user presses , <EOS> we turn that into a message , <EOS> um and then we need a sending mechanism to send it to the receiver . <EOS> now <EOS> i would have hoped <EOS> i think that's my only slide actually , <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i would have have hoped to um do you a pretty powerpoint slide of um my first cut design , <EOS> but unfortunately the technology defeated me , <EOS> so if you'll bear with me i'll do it on the whiteboard . <EOS> so <EOS> we want an energy source <EOS> which is there . <EOS> and we've got to think about what that might be . <EOS> uh we obviously don't want wires on this thing . <EOS> uh typically it would be a battery , <EOS> but i'm open to suggestions . <EOS> um and <EOS>
okay . <EOS> well <EOS> that's that's my findings . <EOS> so uh <EOS> my personal opinion is that we should go more modern look . m_p_ three player . <EOS> and uh well um <EOS> if we want to put in speech rec recognition or something , we i don't think we should put it on top then . <EOS> i think that , if we're gonna put in more technology , that you need to be able to uh switch it open . <EOS>
you mean like hierarchical structure . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> and inside this this thing you can move , maybe switch . <EOS> if you want to see a movie you click on the movie button so you have all the movie channels and after you've you plus plus plus . <EOS> i it just an idea . <EOS> i don't know what you think about that but . <EOS>
it's it's chew proof . <EOS> it's made edible 'cause kids eat it , <EOS> and if it's wasn't edible then <EOS> yeah . <EOS> well , normal babies . <EOS> actually that makes sense , <EOS> because i remember like , peopl i dunno if my mom ever did it but i remember other people's moms making like home-made play-doh where you just like make the colouring and make some sort of sort of dough . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm . <EOS> not the user , <EOS> the man mana t_v_ manager mode . <EOS> ah , i dunno . <EOS> okay . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> so we have five minutes left . um . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> uh . <EOS> so i think s the settings we th we are agreeing are agreed that they're required . <EOS> it's just how to a <EOS>
you need a screen with music because you're looking for a specific song , <EOS> like you know that band or whatever . <EOS> with t_v_ channels it's , you know , one two three . so <EOS> but like if you think about it <EOS> yeah but if <EOS> so is it just okay . <EOS> so , b you you're gonna have to switch to like d_v_d_ and like other things like that , aren't you ? <EOS> are we <EOS>
would we even technically be possible to include video recorder functions on it ? <EOS> i don't know that yet . <EOS> um or should we just stick to just stick to having television television related buttons on it ? <EOS> mm . <EOS> it's a good question . um . <EOS> i'll look into that . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yellow ? t_v_ remote control ? <EOS> min <EOS> maybe you can change the colour , <EOS> but the image of the society has to be recognised . <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i think if you have you know th like a yellow ribbon here is the double r_ . or should be . <EOS> yeah , so . <EOS> doesn't need to be completely yellow , <EOS> but just mm . <EOS>
how much would you <EOS> you don't answer to this uh questionnaire ? <EOS> oh <EOS> yes <EOS> i mm i dunno mm , <EOS> i think six , it's a good uh <EOS> so it will have five point five average . <EOS> five point five average . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> wa can . <EOS> okay . <EOS> i <EOS> sorry . <EOS>
ah yeah that wouldn't make sense . <EOS> it's cool . i'm impressed . <EOS> don't have no one to handle that . <EOS> mm that's <EOS> oh that's <EOS> oh i like it . <EOS> i mean you guys gave me more than i was asking for , so i'm happy <EOS> because we've got some really marketable features in this . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> um yeah i think i think it's <EOS> i think it's good . <EOS> i mean my personal views on on leadership is that effective effective leadership sort of um gives people a certain room for freedom and delegation , <EOS> but then to come back with something that they take great ownership and <EOS>
. <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm , mm-hmm . <EOS> uh-huh . <EOS> right . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay <EOS> that's uh <EOS> again i don't think that's ever been done before , <EOS> it's uh the sort of the sort of thing that would get people uh thinking yes that's something that i haven't got and uh <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> i mean it's people say that it's the look , they want the fancy looking thing <EOS> but i'm <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i'm not convinced on whether having changeable covers would be something that people would buy into . <EOS> i think with the mobiles , it's the , you know it's a communication device , <EOS> people see you with it all about and <EOS>
mm . <EOS> design ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> design yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> i mean everything speaks for itself i guess . <EOS> mean you press a button um the it tru goes , it sends a signal to a chip , <EOS> which uh translates it into infrared signal of certin spatial frequencies . <EOS> and uh or temporal fr frequencies actually . <EOS> and then uh through a uh transformer , it the signal gets boosted and then sent to the to the receiver on the t_v_ <EOS> and the t_v_ will translate it into a function . <EOS> um <EOS>
uh-huh mm . <EOS> in most families , don't isn't the remote is a remote . <EOS> y yeah , <EOS> but i think i think what this would allow is perhaps a person in the family who had the most opinion about it <EOS> we all need a remote , <EOS> but the person who is really perhaps active in personalising , i'm thinking the teenager , the someone fifteen to thirty five would go out and get this additional thing the same way as you mentioned that people would get the cell phone covers . <EOS>
we can think about t_v_ with you know where you can change you know the aspects o like for the cell phones , you know . <EOS> fifteen years <EOS> customable t_v_ . <EOS> yeah , you customise it every ti so every ti if people change , you just change the appearance , and y y you can keep <EOS>
then uh i will try with the technical team to to build a prototype <EOS> and to see uh with uh h how this little box would uh look look like . <EOS> and how an and we can uh start troubleshooting first uh com communication problems or things like that . <EOS> and when we are ready with this first prototype i i think we can add some software functionalities on a programmable chip like browsing by content or um things like that . <EOS> okay so can you go down uh <EOS>
pardon me ? <EOS> this is the menu yes , yes . <EOS> a the the these <EOS> these two are th to increase or decrease the volumes , <EOS> and these two are to uh scroll the programme channels . <EOS> okay . <EOS> f f okay . <EOS> right , very good . <EOS>
um so actually i think <EOS> yeah um f <EOS> you guys wanna give a prototype presentation of <EOS> okay <EOS> well um . <EOS> so our design looks something like this . <EOS> this being the wheel that you use to uh change channels or volume or whatever . <EOS> this is a button , serves as the power button if you hold it down , and if you just tap on it i think it brings up the menu . <EOS> and uh the base of the remote control , which has a squishy spongy rubbery feel , is interchangeable . <EOS> so you can change the colour , according to your to suit your living room or whatever . <EOS> and it comes <EOS> yeah , i can change the vegetable . <EOS> this one's broccoli . <EOS> so this snaps off and you can put on whichever one you want . <EOS> this is not to scale 'cause it would have the battery inside it . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah , 'cause i think you program um this one yourself , like to say like whatever you want to your question . <EOS> yeah , yeah . <EOS> yeah and ours is quite a cheap device , <EOS> so i don't know how much we'll be able to put into it . <EOS>
well , as you can see , the quality of the work today is um <EOS> mm . <EOS> i think it's outstandingly good . <EOS> okay , now i'm gonna have to change what is was originally gonna be <EOS> because that looks like a beak now , so . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> yep . <EOS> yep . <EOS> so <EOS> and that uh will uh <EOS> we have some uh forty minutes uh to complete this uh . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> so um <EOS> who has the fir <EOS> do you ha anna do you have your presentation ready ? <EOS>
yes . <EOS> yep . <EOS> ta-da . <EOS> right . <EOS> alright . <EOS> over to you . <EOS> well . <EOS> ooh , <EOS> two . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> well you see , <EOS> each made one , <EOS> we didn't have enough yellow dough . <EOS> ah . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> you wouldn't wanna have to have splinters in your hand while you're using your <EOS> it's really good if your dog gets ahold of it , they can use it for teething . <EOS> they do that anyway with the rubber and plastic , <EOS> so , and chew 'em up . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> no stepping on the table <EOS> and then looking at the internet page . <EOS> and i was working and working and work <EOS> okay , well um <EOS> but after all we can say uh we are satisfied , <EOS> but it it could've been uh better . <EOS> when we get uh when we have <EOS> we would have gotten uh more information . <EOS>
but i'll have a bash at it . <EOS> uh . <EOS> ooh ooh <EOS> i lost it there . <EOS> i think i've just knocked the microphone . um . <EOS> so you're just doing the face . <EOS> we'll g then we'll go for a a s small small bear . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> i like i like the colourful buttons as well . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> and the mouse one , i thought it was a good idea , <EOS> because people use mo mice mouses now with the scrolling thing . um . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i mean we are marketing to sort of twenty five to thirty five , <EOS> so most people <EOS>
um . we should probably start wrapping up , <EOS> um we've got some initial ideas that we can all look into . <EOS> um , and come up with some new ones for the next meeting , <EOS> which will be in another thirty minutes . um . <EOS> so . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> the industrial designer , <EOS> what does that stand for , i_d_ , <EOS> yeah <EOS> um is going to be looking more into the working design . <EOS> so i guess you'd be looking at lots of the things we discussed about screen and um that sort of thing . <EOS> the <EOS>
so the case . <EOS> so we are all already nineteen . <EOS> wooden . <EOS> okay , <EOS> just keep on going , just to have an idea . <EOS> the solar cell is too expensive . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> is yes a wooden pl i and that's <EOS> there's no wood , so plastic just only , i think . <EOS>
yeah they do , <EOS> they <EOS> yeah they've got dual things , but they're the batteries are smaller i think . <EOS> mm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> another question is like <EOS> sorry . <EOS> w w which one would last the longest , <EOS> because we don't want customers to be like you know charging like a mobile phone every day . <EOS>
i think <EOS> oh give us the slideshow and something on your screen ? <EOS> mm . <EOS> i'm not sure . <EOS> you could maybe minimise that screen <EOS> and then <EOS> have something yeah . yeah . <EOS> oh well . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> have them both up at the same time i think . <EOS>
so maybe we'll loose a few option uh options , <EOS> but i think i this is more important . um <EOS> especially the important buttons , um if you want to switch channel , change your volume , uh use teletext , it uh it has to work at once <EOS> and more advanced options may be put it s somewhere away on the remote , behind uh a little uh little thing or a touch screen . <EOS>
the line is a bit off . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> so it's maybe a bit unnatural also . <EOS> yep . <EOS> alright . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> you can point to where you want the line to be . <EOS> but <EOS> the project uh because of the deadlines you didn't had the time to uh have , you didn't have time to uh to make a very uh qualitati qualitative uh presentation . <EOS>
no <EOS> you're not connected to me anymore . <EOS> one one thing to cons <EOS> one thing to consider is that in some ways you want um by having a fairly standard case it means they can all fit together on top of each other <EOS> therefore for storage purposes in shops and the like and it makes it easier that you can if you can store them up on top of each other . <EOS> whereas if you do um fancy things with it , you then gotta put it in a ca a a packaging box that that does that . <EOS> and the cost of packaging could be quite important vis-a-vis the total cost of the product . <EOS>
yeah , batteries . <EOS> yes , rechargeable batteries , i think's best . <EOS> okay . <EOS> not a separate <EOS> okay . <EOS> and uh a chip , that's this one . <EOS> no , <EOS> just rechargeable batteries . <EOS> then uh i received some possibilities . <EOS> um for the energy source we can use batteries <EOS> or a kinetic uh like with the pulse watch . <EOS> so <EOS> it operates on your wrist kinda . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> i think we needn't <EOS> what if um the it was just patterns on like <EOS> we we chose the shape or the sh shape could be whatever we wanted and then it would just be like a design on the rubber . <EOS> huh ? <EOS> oh okay . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> yeah , up down . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> okay , um <EOS> finishing the meeting now . <EOS> um our next meeting starts in thirty minutes , <EOS> um you each have things to do , look and feel design , user interface design , product evaluation , <EOS> and you two are going to work together on a prototype using modelling clay . <EOS> you'll get specific instructions from your personal coach . <EOS>
yeah , yeah . <EOS> yeah , . <EOS> okay . so <EOS> okay . so let's go for the the lunch break , <EOS> okay , thank you . <EOS> and we will meet after . <EOS> okay , thank you . <EOS> okay . thank you . <EOS>
right . <EOS> i think one of the things that we can put right on the box is , never buy another battery . <EOS> you know , something like that . <EOS> okay . <EOS> yep . <EOS> 'kay . thanks guys . <EOS> yep . <EOS> no that's not what i want , i want <EOS> oh look it here . <EOS>
hmm . <EOS> okay . <EOS> it'd probably be lighting up the key too , <EOS> right ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> 'kay . <EOS> so you can put it in the dark . <EOS> the buttons . <EOS> yeah , and that's good . <EOS> we should make it glow in the dark . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> um , i haven't been able to <EOS> um , do you have trouble whistling ? <EOS> really ? <EOS> ooh . <EOS> i don't , but i i know a lot of people do right . <EOS> yeah <EOS> it just <EOS> i mean it has to be a certain kind of whistle too , right ? <EOS>
oh yeah . <EOS> dog . <EOS> okay . <EOS> transfer . it's a dog in a village . <EOS> good . <EOS> okay . <EOS> so <EOS> what are you sug going to do now ? <EOS> i think it's done . <EOS> yeah , i think <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
is rubber . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah i hadn't i hadn't really thought of that to be honest . <EOS> uh <EOS> i just had another idea , <EOS> i don't know if it helps with that , <EOS> but just to do with the r_s_i_ . <EOS> is it possible , just as an option , when we open it up , people can use their fingers to press the button , or we have inside like a small pointer thing when people want to . <EOS> mm . <EOS>
one , you have . <EOS> uh wood ? <EOS> but it's yeah , <EOS> a a rubber uh <EOS> rather four buttons . <EOS> oh no , interface . <EOS> uh do we need special colour ? <EOS> y maybe , two ? <EOS> we have two special colours . <EOS> push button . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah , if <EOS> or it would be better . <EOS> plastic is free . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so , do we need special colour ? <EOS> yeah , that's one of the requirement . <EOS> because we have red . <EOS> yeah , red and yellow . <EOS> fancy . <EOS>
the sample speaker is two d wait , f s four points . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> but it's t <EOS> yes , four points . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> but it is uh it it is a new feature , <EOS> it is something special . <EOS> and then you can keep the curve . <EOS> or can't you ? <EOS>
nee . <EOS> hard to lose . oh right . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> this this is hard to lose . <EOS> it is hard to lose . yeah , <EOS> so then this is it is almost true , <EOS> so a two . <EOS> this <EOS> i think yeah , i think also . <EOS>
yeah okay . yeah . <EOS> yep , true . <EOS> then a two . <EOS> oh . okay . <EOS> this is a a power indicator . so you can see how far it's charged up . <EOS> okay . <EOS> and and you need n uh a button to call it , to let it beep . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> or what if it looks like a pen ? <EOS> doesn't matter , yeah . <EOS> i'm just jus i talking about some something to make this thing unique . <EOS> it <EOS> that's the thing , i'm gonna keep thumping on . <EOS> i'll sell whatever you guys design . <EOS> i don't have a problem selling a product , <EOS> that's not the issue . <EOS> i give you ideas , <EOS> you guys create the product . <EOS> once you have the finished product i'll find a way to sell it . <EOS> don't worry about it . <EOS> i just give you these things now , because these are my thoughts and feelings . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> so basically not point or click press any particular device , he just has to click on that particular icon to simplify . <EOS> and on the top m repetitive buttons which are like volume or channel changing and all could be on the pointing device , <EOS> that means the use of button . <EOS> so he need not use a pointer to keep changing the channel if a person is frequent surfer . <EOS>
yeah , totally , <EOS> i mean that was fairly tight anyway , <EOS> i mean especially with that last-minute alteration . <EOS> back it , this is just had to be changed <EOS> . and yeah , so cool . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
yes . <EOS> yes . <EOS> the one that i don't want to have in the next room ? <EOS> well , just discuss i yeah , <EOS> for instance , i mean <EOS> no , no , <EOS> i was thinking just ask people around you what they think about this . <EOS> and i think , yeah , it will be nice to to come with maybe a sketch of of these . <EOS> if you can do slides , it's even better , <EOS> but uh don't be that formal . <EOS> and uh we'll try to at least build up one coherent proposal , <EOS> and we'll merge it with the other one when the other one uh is available . <EOS>
like that we know the battery's working . <EOS> yeah , so you don't have to stare at that infra-red , <EOS> 'cause you know when the battery starts dying in your remote currently , you have to actually stare at that bulb and go , okay , when i push this button , is it working ? <EOS> we can skip that whole thing . <EOS> yep . <EOS>
okay <EOS> okay <EOS> okay . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah , m maybe the banana could be like a bit uh fatter than than the c c common one . <EOS> but <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , it should remember banana , but it's not doesn't have to b to be uh uh really the size and exactly the shape of a banana . <EOS>
um , do you have any idea so far , <EOS> like when we're saying that we'd need an advanced chip for an l_c_d_ , <EOS> does that in shoot the cost up by a drastic amount ? or ? <EOS> need an advanced chip for the l_c_d_ . <EOS> is that did i <EOS>
yep . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah yeah that's right . <EOS> uh we can ha have build a more complex design if if they want it , <EOS> but but uh what i'm trying to say here is that the um we have different sets of buttons for different kinds of people . <EOS> so in terms of easy to use i think it's very user customisable . <EOS> user customisation is very important <EOS> yeah . yeah <EOS> so <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> so how do you switch <EOS> menu . <EOS> you know actually our our new project requirements , i'm not sure if they meant o onl use only for television as in not for d_v_d_ or just not internet type things . <EOS> so i'll i'll check that and update you on the next <EOS> but we'll hold off on that 'cause <EOS>
yeah you're right . <EOS> okay , so push buttons for the traditional users so that they don't feel they are alienated , <EOS> just <EOS> and a scroll button with push technology for channel selection , volume control and teletext browsing . <EOS> these are the three scroll buttons which are already available with us in the company <EOS> and we we can go ahead with that . <EOS>
but <EOS> so you are <EOS> ah . <EOS> ah , a big jump . <EOS> yeah then yeah that's right . <EOS> a mouse or <EOS> well , not a mouse <EOS> but uh something that that says more clearly that uh right , left , up , down , <EOS> well , the to have the ability to to to write something to the navigator , maybe directly , or <EOS>
uh possibly . <EOS> do we really need t to provide more information on what r_s_i_ is ? <EOS> like <EOS> uh yeah , that's what my web site said , <EOS> i <EOS> oh . <EOS> channel , volume , power . <EOS> don't know . <EOS> i think that's a pretty good guess though . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> draw . draw . alright . <EOS> okay and in the format menu you can select colour and line width , etcetera etcetera . <EOS> okay ? <EOS> 'kay . <EOS> uh okay . <EOS> each of you can uh take some practice <EOS> and you should draw an animal .
alright , okay . <EOS> right . <EOS> that's groovy . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> well i like the feel of it , i like the feel of it . <EOS> uh can i have <EOS> yeah , sure . <EOS> um that one is <EOS> oh no , it's delicate . <EOS>
yeah , <EOS> i've seen some people just going like that with their thumb , yeah . <EOS> yeah . or your thumb or something . so <EOS> yeah <EOS> i use it like that . <EOS> w when we had the wheely remote control , we it was on the top i think , if you held it like that . <EOS>
we put fashion into electronics . <EOS> w <EOS> it's my understanding that if you were going to do a skin you'd need to have some way for people to download or import skins into the remote control . <EOS> yeah <EOS> i think perhaps <EOS> good idea <EOS> but yeah <EOS> i think that that one m might just be um <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> oh yeah we have to f uh include that in our design as well . <EOS> i don't see any power cables here so <EOS> let's see . <EOS> yeah . yes . <EOS> what the hell's that ? <EOS> i think uh it's the sensors . <EOS> okay . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> okay , <EOS> then teletext is used less . <EOS> mm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> then teletext is useless for them i think , <EOS> yeah . <EOS> because they they have other means of finding their information . yeah . <EOS> but yeah . nope . <EOS>
you should <EOS> if you want to react uh about this wonderful drawing uh i'll let you uh comment . <EOS> it's an abstract drawing of an orangutan . <EOS> okay it's an abstract drawing . <EOS> yes . <EOS> i think it's nice and original . <EOS> you should write y the name i think . <EOS>
up . <EOS> yeah , okay . <EOS> yeah so um taking that away , our uh the the the rubber but rubber buttons are the more reliable <EOS> it's the the ones that would al would allow us to to market our product as being you know less prone to damage <EOS> and more resistant to things like spillage of liquids over it <EOS> or you know mistreat misuses
okay . <EOS> no you know <EOS> it's a conceptual question , <EOS> 'cause now i see th this the picture in front of my eyes <EOS> like a user taking his remote control <EOS> and shouting into it , volume up , volume up , <EOS> and and he's coming you know , he's really annoyed with this , down , up , down . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> like the shape of it almost like a mouse , <EOS> with a <EOS> yeah , <EOS> or yeah uh th th the i mean thi this is what the <EOS> we have to come up with is the the actual shape <EOS> that people can ins instantly pick it up and and know know uh know what it's going to do . <EOS>
it's one way . <EOS> no . <EOS> but then you have to have a template for every channel , for a hundred channels , <EOS> you have to be able to to recognize <EOS> it's not a lot one hundred templates , <EOS> it's not <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> well , i f i think it's probably more than , than our can handle because it's designed for a coffee machine , you know , to say hello in the morning . <EOS>
oh yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> it's a very good point . <EOS> it is a very good point . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i think we d i think we decided that w we're actually going down both routes . <EOS> that um the we n <EOS> we need the the manual controls <EOS> and that they should be of that form , <EOS> but that uh yeah . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> the television lights . <EOS> yeah well i i suppose that i suppose that uh that this remote control won't be in the in the room like this , where there is light only when when there are people , but . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> at least when there is t_v_ you can get light from the t_v_ . <EOS> i dunno . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> right . <EOS> 'cause you also have to know which way around to point this thing . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> because it doesn't have a cord , like joysticks do . <EOS> you know , all <EOS> that dif batteries <EOS> right , <EOS> and batteries go weak as well , <EOS> so um <EOS> after a while you have to point it towards the uh towards the equipment you wanna control with it , <EOS> right ? <EOS> so , have to m show which is the front , which is the back . <EOS>
well . uh , <EOS> we have assembled our prototype , um . <EOS> what's to be said about it ? <EOS> um , we took into account a lot of the things <EOS> that we went over in the last meeting , um . <EOS> some of the most important things to consider are that we decided not to go for the touch screen <EOS> which you can see <EOS> and opted for some very large buttons for the primary functions , um . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> and who watches t_v_ . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> um , i think it'll be the mid range to the high end market , in terms of people . <EOS> 'cause twenty five euros for a remote , how much is that lo locally in pounds ? <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> well i mean we really got into talking about like personal practicalit <EOS> like it wasn't necessarily what was like <EOS> we would never have thought of fruit or sponginess you know ? <EOS> so it's <EOS> yeah . <EOS> if i hadn't been told that fruit was <EOS>
no . <EOS> well it doesn't , but it uh <EOS> no . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> and l_c_ display . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so , as we can see , that's way too expensive down here . <EOS> wh wh what's our criteria ? <EOS>
okay . <EOS> so so <EOS> do note the grade we have five , six for me , <EOS> five . <EOS> and what what's your choice ? <EOS> how much would you give on the fancy aspect , on the fashionable aspect ? <EOS> five . <EOS> oh sorry . <EOS> six <EOS> uh s you can <EOS> how much what ? <EOS>
of the technical function , <EOS> so uh <EOS> so i think it's you , huh ? <EOS> uh it's <EOS> no ? <EOS> that's me . <EOS> techni function of <EOS> what effect <EOS> no , <EOS> user requiremen <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> wait a second . <EOS> argh . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> can't we have different colours in the remotes , <EOS> so somebody can choose different col <EOS> like does it have to be of a certain ? <EOS> well , see the thing is is we've gotta keep the company image . <EOS> it's gotta say <EOS> people have gotta look at this remote control and instantly recognise that it's a real reaction i product . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> if we'd had that sheet at the beginning should've been like , okay , so we can have that lot , let's just throw it together and do what we can . <EOS> yeah , that or not , yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah , yeah , yeah . <EOS>
if it is fancy or not . <EOS> okay . <EOS> is it better like that ? <EOS> looks okay , <EOS> let's say it's a pineapple now . <EOS> i mean <EOS> so we can we can say t <EOS> the colour , is the colour acceptable ? <EOS> no , the colour is okay , that's fine . <EOS> i mean it's <EOS> but i would say there is more too much red . <EOS>
any questions ? <EOS> what we're gonna be discussing at the next meeting ? <EOS> do we know that ? <EOS> i haven't gotten an agenda yet , <EOS> um i'll put that together . <EOS> i'm sure as we'll each get our own instruction <EOS> and then um because what we gonna do is first our individual actions <EOS> and then we'll come back together . <EOS> so i'm sure we'll all have more concrete things to contribute next time <EOS>
maybe the wheel can be uh like uh like this . <EOS> o um if you draw it like this , you get a <EOS> what the fuck is it ? <EOS> okay . mm <EOS> doesn't work . <EOS> you see what i mean ? <EOS> if i draw here <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> we have to sell a t_v_ with the remote control too . <EOS> yeah , we don't <EOS> yeah because are you just wondering what controller okay . <EOS> yeah , i think so . <EOS> j j just the remote control . <EOS> yeah , not the t_v_s . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> even though it is for just a t_v_ remote it's uh very advanced . <EOS> but it is just a t_v_ remote . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i'd go for a three or four on that one , so <EOS> okay , <EOS> let's go for a three point five . <EOS>
and to prove that we weren't wasteful we didn't waste a single bit of play-doh , <EOS> we used every bit . <EOS> nice . <EOS> all four of those little containers . <EOS> including the s the multi-coloured wave pattern . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> i guess <EOS> my one my one criticism is that we didn't have enough colours to work with , <EOS> we only had four , <EOS> wasn't enough . <EOS>
if you hear some click <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah but imagine you y <EOS> yeah i'm i'm no i'm not definitely convinced it's it's the best way to if you wanna jump from , i dunno , one to twenty ? <EOS> oh yeah , that's difficult . that's dif that's difficult . <EOS>
mm . yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . yeah . <EOS> mm . <EOS> have the power , wherever , somewhere . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i mean that was just an idea that i had . <EOS> i mean i've uh yeah . <EOS> oh no <EOS> that <EOS> well <EOS> there's the sim my <EOS> my idea was something a b probably you know a bit fatter than this but sort of tha that sorta shape <EOS> so that you can just sort of ho hold it . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yep . <EOS> there's um on and off , um volume and channel , and skip to certain channels with the numbers . <EOS> right okay . <EOS> um <EOS> well , one one way i would look at this um would be that we a approach the different controls in terms of um like control types , <EOS> so that for the user it's very clear what they want to do where they go . <EOS> uh and also think maybe a little bit about sorta w w what would just wanna be acc easily accessible . <EOS> for example if we had audio controls , those could be something people set up very rarely . <EOS> maybe they're un they're they're they're in a little area but covered up um , <EOS> things like channel and volume um are used all the time , <EOS> so we just have them right out on top , <EOS> um very just very sort of self-explanatory . <EOS> um so maybe we need to think about having three or more groupings of controls , <EOS> you know like one which are just the the habitual ones that should be right within your natural grip . <EOS> and others that are uh also available <EOS> and then others that are concealed . <EOS> something like that . <EOS>
okay , well <EOS> i think we're ready to begin . <EOS> right , <EOS> my name's adam duguid , <EOS> we're here because of real reaction , <EOS> um , we have in the group <EOS> oh , <EOS> ebenezer ademesoye . <EOS> would you like me to spell that ? <EOS> s <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> and what i keep throwing out there i just keep throwing out ideas to try to make this thing look or act or in some way identify itself as unique or different . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> but you guys are the ones that have to c ultimately create the product within cost . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> mm . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm <EOS> yeah like <EOS> i would say that for programming uh keys , you said , uh it could be uh easily uh done within the the package of twel twelve euros , <EOS> but for the a_s_r_ system , uh i'm not sure if it's feasible to have this <EOS> or
uh . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> i th think it's not the most spongy thing . <EOS> i think it's a three . <EOS> yeah , it's a three , <EOS> because you want to make it uh rather flexible but not too flexible , <EOS> because it has a l_c_d_ screen . <EOS>
oh <EOS> really ? <EOS> okay . <EOS> i think . <EOS> i don't know . <EOS> otherwise it's just saying i'm the secretary <EOS> and i'm therefore i'm taking the minutes , <EOS> s so just to go <EOS> um just real briefly to go over minutes from last meeting , <EOS> uh , i will open them slowly , no ? <EOS> wait for it , wait for it . <EOS>
yes . <EOS> mm mm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> sure that fits the <EOS> yes <EOS> and of course it will be a we we get a <EOS> if it works we can get uh after-sales <EOS> i mean that would would be very good <EOS> i mean those covers could go for for three , five euro . <EOS>
okay it's your turn to <EOS> okay , okay . <EOS> so i think my favourite animal would be a c a cat . <EOS> oh . <EOS> that's its head . <EOS> um i probably like cats the most because they're cuddly and furry and uh playful . <EOS> okay . <EOS>
do you want this and we can all <EOS> no . <EOS> i guess we're supposed to discuss um the prod the process of the project and how satisfied <EOS> oh , oh it's alright . <EOS> uh . yeah . <EOS> um <EOS> it's alright yeah ? <EOS> did you feel there was a lot of room for creativity in the sort of <EOS>
yeah . yeah , <EOS> or if it had a <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah yeah yeah yeah . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> i mean <EOS> well that's why it's always in the couch . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , in in the couch . <EOS> i dunno , <EOS> it seems like though that that would be hard , 'cause you not you're not gonna be lazy anyway and <EOS>
hmm . <EOS> w we need we need we need s some more buttons if it would to work on some other stuff , but <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm , <EOS> but you follow what i'm s i'm s <EOS> we we w yeah <EOS> we could get another version of it that actually works . <EOS> but uh <EOS>
well , <EOS> but in order to pre-set a cha <EOS> oh <EOS> i guess you can just hold it down when you get to one when you're scrolling through . <EOS> yeah , yeah , <EOS> you can just <EOS> and you need some kind of , i dunno , sort of up down kind of button , <EOS> but the volume control could double for that , for example . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> yes , the moustache . <EOS> so <EOS> that's that's definitely a cat . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> uh yeah . <EOS> and i th they like to sleep , <EOS> that's why you said you they are like this . <EOS> it's quite , you know relaxed situation . <EOS> yes . <EOS>
um okay , so um <EOS> so shall we make the decision uh to include speech recognition <EOS> if we can . <EOS> if we can . <EOS> i i think one thing we should try not to avoid is not to say we have to use speech recognition right now , <EOS> because um , based on what you've go y everybody's saying , right , you want something simple . <EOS> you want basic stuff and you want something that's easy to use . <EOS> speech recognition might not be the simplest thing for somebody to use . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> i was thinking if it was like this <EOS> 'cause the way you were describing the the ipod and the thi the roll thingy <EOS> it's like it has to be s <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> it's almost like your thumb is farther up , <EOS> so if if you could squish it lower then <EOS>
not helping . <EOS> oh well i guess it depends on the stiffness a little of it . <EOS> yeah <EOS> and it depends on if it's sliding , <EOS> but i think it's pretty ergonomic . <EOS> you can feel it . <EOS> mm . feels good . <EOS> i take it that this is gonna be slightly lighter in the final design as well . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> you feel like you're caged within whatever y <EOS> it's like a balloon in a cage , it can only go so big and not hit the side . <EOS> the constraints do come in very fast . <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah within the constraints <EOS> the <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> so it is a possibility , um . <EOS> but we are supposed to use the um company colour scheme , aren't we ? <EOS> we haven't really seen that yet <EOS> yes oh that's true <EOS> uh that might no <EOS>
okay . <EOS> uh , right <EOS> i'm responsible for working design , <EOS> uh , this is basically the inside going on of the the uh remote control . <EOS> so we have the energy source , <EOS> we have the user interface , <EOS> this this is what i've seen . <EOS> uh the sender will push the button , <EOS> the chip will respond , <EOS> uh and then the dig digital signal is sent to the t_v_ . <EOS> so uh uh , <EOS> if you go to next slide , <EOS> you'll see you'll see uh what do we need on the user interface . <EOS> do we need uh many buttons , <EOS> or do we need l many light bulbs <EOS> that could be easier to uh to realise which appliances are on or not . <EOS> um , , or would that take too much power , <EOS> would we need more um components in there to supply the power ? <EOS> um , the joystick is another thing , <EOS> if we were gonna add that , um , there'd be more components to deal with that . <EOS> um , so uh <EOS> we need to <EOS> i dunno exactly what <EOS>
mm . <EOS> i guess . just looking at examples , y you just don't ever see the logo on a button , it's always on the actual casing . <EOS> right . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> there's nothing saying that we have to put the logo on the front of the actual <EOS>
and then i th i i personally thought the front side of the shape should be something for the youngsters like like <EOS> oh <EOS> y <EOS> this or something . <EOS> it's it's a bit like a banana . <EOS> and the colour should be yellow , or something . <EOS> and for the elderly people just plain old . <EOS> because we decided to have two kind of remotes , two designs , <EOS> or was it two colours ? <EOS> different colours , yeah . <EOS> we should decide whether it's going to be with round shapes . <EOS> i think like my colleague , you said , is that's e better , or for the elderly people something like like the ipod or something , with round squares . <EOS> simple but <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> brilliant . <EOS> mm . <EOS> okay . <EOS> mm . <EOS> did we talk about the voice recognition uh option ? <EOS> and <EOS> oh no , we haven't talked about that yet have we ? <EOS> so uh so uh yeah <EOS> on the back here you all noticed this area here which is actually the voice recognition uh uh console <EOS> and uh i think it's nicely designed into the into the overall look . <EOS> um , but basically the voice recognition uh incorporates um the latest designs that our research team has been able to cufw uh come up with . <EOS> basically uh quite similar to the coffee maker um design that we were talking about earlier <EOS> and um , i think that uh has given a proven um ease of use and what not . <EOS> and uh allows features like the remote actually talking back to the user um , so . <EOS>
plastic , <EOS> okay . <EOS> for the inside . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm , <EOS> so we decided on a rubber casing for the plastic shell , a variety of designs , <EOS> okay . <EOS> plast right . <EOS> oh i think so , i think so . <EOS>
yeah . for s such a phone ? i mean <EOS> well <EOS> they make it for mobiles , <EOS> it can't be that much more complicated . <EOS> but why do you want to cover that actually ? <EOS> in that uh w in the mod <EOS> well <EOS> just with the with the flexible plastic uh <EOS>
especially you might need something like that for training the speech recognition and yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> trendy , fancy , feels good , <EOS> uh with a display , wood , designer wood , designer colours <EOS> , we might've <EOS> you know , maybe what you could do is when somebody orders the device id you could send them like um a uh uh b some sort of a foam rubber um ball , <EOS> and then they would squeeze it , and it would take the shape of their hand . <EOS>
uh <EOS> and <EOS> mm . mm . <EOS> uh , and <EOS> and uh just before starting the detailed discussion , maybe we <EOS> you are the marketing guy ? or <EOS> th <EOS> so you are the marketing . <EOS> and you are in the u use user interface uh design . <EOS> so just yeah <EOS> i wanted to to be sure . <EOS> and i i'm the the industrial designer <EOS> okay . <EOS> because i i don't know you very well , actually , but yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> mael . <EOS> happy to meet you . <EOS> okay . <EOS> it's very uh <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> let's do speech . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> for speech recognition . <EOS> okay , <EOS> so we only do this when we have enough money left . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i <EOS> with uh teletext if it wasn't ver very important , <EOS> it was but <EOS> you also now have colours . <EOS> i don't know if we should implement that . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> when you press the red button , you go to page one hundred two , <EOS> and when you press the <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> fruity . <EOS> fruity loops . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> just all kind of colour . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> maroon . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay , so <EOS> and and do we have to have a normal black one , or uh <EOS> is it <EOS>
mm . <EOS> for technology . <EOS> yeah , i am sort of pret uh <EOS> just the fruit does me in , <EOS> i mean uh it might <EOS> it might be trendy to some , but i'm just not swallowing the fruit , <EOS> so um <EOS> uh also uh i would have liked to have seen the l_c_d_ screen in it . <EOS> um so yeah i'd say about four as well . <EOS>
um , that kind of books . <EOS> badgers are cool in that one too . <EOS> no , that's good . <EOS> you don't really have to , i mean , if you like 'em <EOS> okay . <EOS> and i'm last . <EOS> 'kay . look at my sad sad giraffe . <EOS> no , no , no , <EOS> it ends up looking like some kind of a dinosaur , <EOS> but whatever . <EOS> i don't know even much about giraffes , but i just love the way they look . <EOS> they're just such odd creatures , you know . <EOS> i i like that they're so unique and individual , i guess . <EOS> i don't know much about their behaviour or anything , though . <EOS> only seen a couple in zoos . <EOS> yeah , but you can appreciate the way they look . <EOS>
this is our agenda . <EOS> uh we have our opening acquaintance , tool training , project plan description closing . <EOS> uh maybe i can sit down , <EOS> then i can take some notes <EOS> or <EOS> let's see . <EOS> sure . <EOS> maybe you can take the minutes once in a while . <EOS> i dunno it's not a lot of work , <EOS> but just uh if you hear something uh you can write down , just write it down . <EOS> uh as you can see uh it's the opening , aquaintance tool training . <EOS> aquaintance is a point we've done a bit . <EOS>
it's there but it's <EOS> yeah . <EOS> not only possibly even materials , like the type of plastic used , but everything including size and shape of buttons , positioning of buttons , the actual shape of the hand-held device , colours , the ergonomics , the way it fits in your <EOS>
yeah . i dunno . <EOS> why ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so <EOS> it's actually a pretty trendy colour at the moment . <EOS> it's it's trendy okay . <EOS> but <EOS> yeah . <EOS> my couch is in that colour . <EOS> mm . <EOS> ooh . . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> this function should be very uh accessible . <EOS> yeah , okay . <EOS> this is the main function okay . <EOS> very accessible yes . <EOS> that's right . <EOS> so then we asked some questions to them <EOS> and um we asked this question if they prefer an l_c_d_ screen or on their remultific function remotes control <EOS> and if they mm pay more for speech recognition in remote control <EOS> and you can go <EOS> we have here the results of <EOS>
mm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> so but le let us see first the new requirement . <EOS> so we don't have to <EOS> so this this uh is uh is um in the <EOS> this is in the same direction as we were speaking <EOS> so we don't have to make a very complex remote controls to access teletext and stuff like that <EOS>
battery . <EOS> okay so <EOS> uh first of all energy source , we picked battery . <EOS> um and how many batteries do we think this will probably take ? <EOS> probably <EOS> some e either two or four . <EOS> two . <EOS> two ? <EOS> like it . <EOS>
that's all you've got at the moment , <EOS> or did you have anything more ? <EOS> um no , that's it , <EOS> yeah . <EOS> that's it ? <EOS> alright . <EOS> so , finance . <EOS> and we'll see if we can unscrew this first . <EOS> cool , there we go . <EOS>
yes . <EOS> i'll go first . okay . i'll go first yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> well . <EOS> you can go first , okay . <EOS> well , <EOS> shall i go first with the users ? <EOS> well <EOS> everybody already has his presentation , <EOS> so you can adjust it . <EOS>
'kay . <EOS> right ? <EOS> um that's not um <EOS> i'd say a bit smaller would probably be nice . <EOS> you wanna play with that over there . <EOS> there you go . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> it's you know it's flimsy 'cause it's made out of heavy play-doh , <EOS> but <EOS>
so then we have sample sensor and sample speaker , then uh we have the wood material , then special colour and push button . <EOS> so it's uh <EOS> actually , our budget was uh twelve point five euro , <EOS> but uh it's coming to nine point nine five euro , <EOS> so we are under uh below the budget , <EOS> okay , so still we are saving some money . <EOS> i think it's a good figure . <EOS>
possibly . <EOS> oh yeah , <EOS> still have 'em . <EOS> yeah . totally . <EOS> yeah ? <EOS> i think so . <EOS> yep . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> you don't . <EOS> no i , no i dunno , i d i i dunno , <EOS> i don't i i was just i <EOS>
um i had some things sent to me . not very much . <EOS> to look at similar devices . <EOS> um defined in some them . <EOS> and then the personal preferences that i will suggest . <EOS> um we discussed a universal one . <EOS> um like <EOS> it's just been brought up again then . <EOS> but i think a universal remote control is actually quite a difficult object to design , and po possibly within maybe the budget that we do it , <EOS> um because you'd need to know all the spef specifications of a all the like electronic companies . <EOS>
right . <EOS> i don't know what the position is . <EOS> does it have ears ? <EOS> uh no . <EOS> no . <EOS> no . oh okay . <EOS> can you erase ears <EOS> or <EOS> yeah ? <EOS> no . <EOS> the little holes maybe . <EOS> yeah yeah yeah . <EOS> there's a a gum , <EOS> gum to . <EOS>
. <EOS> send me , yeah <EOS> yeah , okay . <EOS> so are we headed towards like a b a big yellow and black remote as far as <EOS> maybe that's our next meeting that we discuss that . <EOS> is it yellow and black or is it yellow and blue ? <EOS> i i kind of thought it was blue writing on a yellow background , <EOS> but i might be just going a bit <EOS>
okay so m so <EOS> then the the idea of uh having a remote is generally you have uh different keys and uh different structures , different forms , <EOS> and uh they could be like buttons or like <EOS> and um they could be of uh a varying sizes if you want to to uh basically emphasize a particular key more than the other , <EOS> and uh maybe like you can have different colours <EOS> for example having the r red for the on off switching on and off the button . <EOS> so this this is the general trend to ha the method they do . <EOS> so what i have found was that uh currently uh the they are mostly that the t_v_ , v_c_r_ , music system operated ones actually , <EOS> and they are very specific to each other , <EOS> but there are some common keys <EOS> for example if you want to follow the v_c_r_ and if you want to follow the uh g uh s some uh soundtrack on the w w see they have the common thing actually you can have <EOS> and uh <EOS>
mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> oh yeah . <EOS> mm . <EOS> hmm , hmm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> like the one that like slides back <EOS> and the buttons are concealed underneath . <EOS> uh . should we actually bite the bullet here ? <EOS> if people really don't use those buttons to any extent at all um remove them altogether . <EOS> we we could actually have we could actually have a remote control with um <EOS>
hmm . <EOS> one five five two is thirteen , over four for now . <EOS> i think that's um <EOS> next ? <EOS> um three . <EOS> six . <EOS> six . <EOS> i wasn't cheating i swear . <EOS> really ? <EOS> two . <EOS> uh-oh . <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
meter adjusting . <EOS> okay . <EOS> oh , there . <EOS> yeah . actually mm some of my points might overlap with what william's just mention , <EOS> but basically my method was like uh whatever brainstorming we did in the last meeting , just a couple of valuable points and started developing on that <EOS> and there might be some missing loops in this thing which i think we'll uh take a feedback from the marketing <EOS> because
yeah . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so , no loose <EOS> maybe we could um <EOS> mm . <EOS> that's why i was thinking , bluetooth , <EOS> 'cause if you like put up bluetooth , and it's like a bluetooth remote control , everybody's gonna like , oh , <EOS> 'cause bluetooth is the in thing nowadays , like it really is , <EOS> like people <EOS> and um when it comes to marketing like that's what people go for , <EOS> they don't really care whether , you know , at the end of the day whether it works properly or not . <EOS>
i agree . <EOS> yeah , but it's not happen yet . yeah . <EOS> well for me <EOS> well you have digital t_v_ still already . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> unless you have a <EOS> yeah . <EOS> well there there is a for example on digital t_v_ systems you have you can press a button and you can buy things in adverts , <EOS> and you can uh you can view through a catalogue for example . <EOS> a a family member of mine has got a system where you just um you can <EOS>
okay , <EOS> now we're gonna dig into the to the serious stuff . <EOS> it's pretty abstract . <EOS> uh the selling price for the remote will be uh twenty five euro , <EOS> and the production cost uh may not be more than uh twenty and a half euro . <EOS> so uh <EOS> from my point of view , i don't think it's uh gonna be very uh very high tech , high definition , uh ultra modern uh kinda remote , for twelve uh fift uh twelve and a half euro . <EOS>
does have a lid or closes , <EOS> so you don't accidentally press a button or record button for something . <EOS> okay , <EOS> like a lock f like a lock functs function on it like you have on your telephones , <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> but make it like really snazzy and cool people will want it . <EOS> so make it <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
but i don't know . <EOS> okay . <EOS> well . <EOS> you know . <EOS> i'm the industrial designer . <EOS> oh , okay , okay . <EOS> not the other one . <EOS> so . <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay . so <EOS> and the marketing expert will <EOS>
two double a_s , for this size . <EOS> but like , you know , if we get more complicated then it's gonna v be have to be bigger to just accommodate the chip size . <EOS> right . <EOS> honestly , i think the customer would be kind of irritated by the fact that it has a base <EOS> if we did do a nice small , compact <EOS>
yeah , w we had so much information , that we get through email and just <EOS> uh . <EOS> uh i think we we got wrong information at the wrong time . <EOS> i think that was the m biggest problem . <EOS> like uh the prices . <EOS> if we knew that before , we could have uh had discussion really uh s really quicker . <EOS>
excuse me . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> you know , innovative thought with . <EOS> in in reality i think here the the different elements of leadership such as the the original b briefing and then the personal coach and the and then you know having having you with your the meeting agenda is actually quite a quite a quite a con confining framework to work within . <EOS> and so it is leadership almost to the point of sort of disempowering the the the team member , so <EOS>
ah , okay i see . <EOS> it's pretty cool . <EOS> is that <EOS> could that be easy to for the scroll wheel to be rotated if it lands on it ? <EOS> yeah that might be a possible a mi uh possible problem , but if you drop it <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> and i don't really think that you need nine numbers . <EOS> i mean how often do you use seven , eight and nine ? <EOS> i think just one to six and then channel up and down should be enough . <EOS> well b uh w <EOS> well th the on the <EOS> well uh for for general television purposes obviously you have channels one to five at this point in time , <EOS> and we'd have to have some room for uh future such channels . <EOS> but but <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> so <EOS> we'll say we'll say uh false . <EOS> easy to use . <EOS> very . <EOS> yes . <EOS> one , <EOS> is that inappropriate ? <EOS> okay . <EOS> oh , pardon me . um <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> trendy . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> ye <EOS> no , <EOS> yeah , <EOS> a user can use any kind of sender <EOS> but they should have this prompt volume and then <EOS> yeah <EOS> volume and decrease or increase , <EOS> so we try to only recognise those words <EOS> and and because we can't really say user to say same wording <EOS> then it become more mechanical and yeah . <EOS>
oh yeah , i can know it . <EOS> it's a <EOS> it's uh very hard to draw . <EOS> okay , that makes it easier . <EOS> i think i know . <EOS> no , wrong . <EOS> mm . <EOS> i think i know what you're trying to draw , but it's wrong already . <EOS>
titanium , the really strong metal , titanium ? is it not also it's expensive ? <EOS> yeah , <EOS> and light . <EOS> uh , i think so as well , yeah . <EOS> they make mountain bikes out of that , <EOS> don't they . <EOS> so it's really light as well . <EOS>
no . <EOS> uh you're going to have a presentation . all of you . <EOS> um and we've got forty minutes for the whole uh prese for the whole uh presentations . <EOS> so uh i suggest we take about seven minutes per presentation , <EOS> and then we can have a little discussion about the new project requirements <EOS> uh which have been sent to me . <EOS> and then the decision on the control functions uh which we wanna include and those which we don't wanna include . <EOS> so <EOS> we've got forty minutes for all of it . <EOS> so <EOS> i suggest um let's start with the first presentation . <EOS> um who wants to be first ? <EOS>
so <EOS> we have to <EOS> uh for <EOS> no . <EOS> hmm . yeah . <EOS> yeah <EOS> so <EOS> are we confident enough on creating trends ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> well , <EOS> that's <EOS> you t can try to convince us . <EOS> well , <EOS> we can make it smell like fruit . <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
okay great s so <EOS> let me just start this . <EOS> okay great . <EOS> so um uh s move on . <EOS> uh-huh oh where'd it all go ? <EOS> it's not good . <EOS> okay lemme just see where i can find it . <EOS> oh no . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> the electronic components <EOS> uh all of the electronic components have all those uh things like a chip and d diode transistors an <EOS> yeah , di um can y uh <EOS> you can see the t_a_ double one eight three five labelled uh chip um . <EOS>
yeah , fair enough . <EOS> uh unless you're really high tech and it sort of just recharges itself if it's n by , you know , magnetic waves or whatever , <EOS> if if it <EOS> it could have like uh know like a cordless phone in your house it s got like a base that sits there all the time . <EOS>
rather than having three different things that people have to do . <EOS> . <EOS> okay . <EOS> there we go . <EOS> oh look , we're way under budget <EOS> and we'll make huge profits <EOS> and we'll all get bonuses . <EOS> yeah , well we could admit to the single curve , couldn't we ? <EOS>
if you're going with the fruit and veg thing , looks like a banana . <EOS> i d i don't thi i don't think that it would be a a structural weakness , <EOS> i mean if you have a firm s sub-structure , you can then incorporate articulation into that . <EOS> if you then have a sort of outer skin of mm flexible , spongy rubber then you have something that is you know very much you know <EOS>
artistic skills , nil . <EOS> fine . <EOS> um . <EOS> oh , thanks . <EOS> bless you . <EOS> i draw like i'm in grade five . <EOS> oh do i . <EOS> 'kay , about one more minute . <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> and who would like to start us off ? <EOS>
um . t yeah . <EOS> uh . well <EOS> for a curved , well i was thinking to f for to sit in your the palm of your hand . <EOS> uh maybe like this , with the uh joy pad here . joystick here . and maybe um an okay button around here , <EOS> so that the thumb can uh use it quite easily . <EOS> um i don't exactly <EOS> double curved . it probably means this is probably double curved . <EOS> uh whereas a single curved would be like that . <EOS> i guess . or not necessarily . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> about . yeah . you have the basic idea . <EOS> i've a basic idea . <EOS> and you two uh are going to do this . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so we're gonna work here ? on this sketchboard ? <EOS> alright . <EOS> thanks . <EOS>
yes . <EOS> now having used a remote control for years does anybody already have like an idea like things you didn't like with it , things you would like to change , things you would like to improve with this thing <EOS> ye any first ideas ? <EOS> would you like it to be smaller , bigger , <EOS> have more have more buttons on it or maybe clearly better marked buttons , you know , things like that ? <EOS>
yeah , <EOS> we are addicts . <EOS> that's scary <EOS> yeah ? <EOS> it is scary . <EOS> mm . <EOS> well <EOS> just around that eight or or nine people that are <EOS> i know , <EOS> imagine we went the first ten y fifteen years of our lives without the internet . <EOS> it's only in the last ten that we're like where's the internet ? <EOS> i mean , you know , <EOS> it just in the past five we've gone from twenty eight eight modems to broadband all the time . <EOS>
yeah , <EOS> which might <EOS> throw some light on that . <EOS> th <EOS> yeah , <EOS> th those are <EOS> felt like had a lot of charts . <EOS> um actually we're , you know , we are almost a half hour out of the forty minutes , <EOS> so we have to get close to finishing . <EOS>
but um <EOS> i i don't know how important that is to keep it exactly the colours of the real reaction company . <EOS> it's just what i'd understood we'd be doing . <EOS> that's before i heard about all this hot tips about the future , fruit-wise . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> but yeah , <EOS> i'm trying to streamline mine a little bit . <EOS>
yeah , <EOS> but <EOS> look fancy . this is a question that should be asked to the if you ask the people , maybe the the marketing people . yeah . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> this is something we sh <EOS> because maybe a colourful is fancy for some people , <EOS> but maybe simple and uh uniform colourful is fancy for some for other peoples , so . <EOS>
it's part of the introduction , <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> um , yeah . <EOS> i don't know really how it works . <EOS> but maybe you can show us first ? <EOS> okay , okay . <EOS> yeah , okay . <EOS> drawing goes with uh this thing . <EOS> do not touch your hand on uh this little uh thingy here . <EOS> that's uh important . <EOS> so hold it uh like this . <EOS>
perfectly yeah yeah of course uh-huh . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> and the functionality of the you mean the social target group who we wants to target ? <EOS> yes i mean well yes w who are we going to uh to well to sell this , the customers , indeed yes . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> mm i mean you c you can easily remove the frame . <EOS> i think one thing important for instance in this remote control if you remember when people use it they're they never find a good button in the right place . <EOS> yeah , yeah . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> uh okay , so good news from me uh uh for me from hamed , <EOS> but bad news from bob obviously , because spongy design , i don't like it as <EOS> okay , so could you please , fabien , open it . <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
okay , <EOS> well done . <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> for the next time you have to uh put it exactly on the square , so your laptop . <EOS> i will . <EOS> oh paul . <EOS> it didn't say that . <EOS> no , <EOS> sorry . <EOS>
oh <EOS> no <EOS> i i interrupted you , <EOS> sorry . <EOS> or <EOS> no no , no <EOS> uh b i was in the middle of in the middle of your report there . <EOS> oh <EOS> okay . <EOS> um well , <EOS> i was just kinda wrapping up there . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> i was thinking um , yeah , maybe such things are relevant . <EOS> we could make things much more f i think the the <EOS> eighty percent of people would spend more on uh a remote uh that looks better , <EOS>
for the functional requirements and especially for the for the user requirements . <EOS> i prepare a marketing report <EOS> and we have to find the weaknesses and and the the improvements we could do to the current remote controls . <EOS> and also i di i did a study with for the incorporation of new technologies <EOS> it seems that the remote controls have been have remained the same for the last five , ten years . <EOS> there is no no significant difference between the the b the first new controls and <EOS>
mm . <EOS> i like it , i like it . <EOS> not like a skin , but like a holder almost if you could do like um , leather options or wood options or something <EOS> hmm . <EOS> i should have mentioned this um . <EOS> as far as the rubber that we can use we can use a rubber as part of the case , <EOS> it has a consistency of those stress balls . <EOS>
yeah , <EOS> there's good news ? <EOS> oh . <EOS> uh <EOS> we have budget problems . <EOS> mm . <EOS> oh . <EOS> i'm afraid you're all sacked . <EOS> oops . <EOS> i don't even have this on . <EOS> cutbacks . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> okay , have you got a presentation to make ? <EOS> no . okay <EOS> so it's just your your show . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yes . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> okay . <EOS> right . so <EOS> we're ready to close that <EOS> and go back to our that one . <EOS> right . <EOS> we're up to the point of the <EOS> go back . <EOS> um the three presentations . <EOS> so we're going to pull the plug on me <EOS> and turn to sarah . <EOS> is that okay ? <EOS>
but uh <EOS> yeah beautiful's is also a matter of taste . <EOS> hmm ? <EOS> um basic colours , <EOS> um yeah . well you didn't say . <EOS> maybe um company colours ? <EOS> ho how do we make uh <EOS> it's black . <EOS> black and yellow . <EOS> can <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> so i took uh that part of the webpage . <EOS> and it says uh fashion-watchers of uh uh pari uh france and uh italy , yeah , uh have detected the following trends . <EOS> this trends i th uh trend i think it's not um that meaningful for us , maybe . <EOS> but it's about uh clothes and shoes . <EOS> but the uh the next uh aspect also in contrast to last year , the feel of material is expe uh uh is expected to be spongy . <EOS> but spongy , what what does spongy says ? <EOS> spongy . <EOS>
hmm . <EOS> yeah , i don't really think that's gonna work , <EOS> but <EOS> okay , so <EOS> two ? um <EOS> yeah . <EOS> excess buttons . <EOS> no . <EOS> are there excess buttons ? <EOS> no . <EOS> no . <EOS> that is false . <EOS> um good , well designed buttons , intuitive buttons . <EOS>
anybody <EOS> mm . <EOS> clay covered banana . <EOS> it's <EOS> this as well , <EOS> sorry , <EOS> we forgot to mention <EOS> it'll be made out of kind of a rubbery latex , new material that we've got . <EOS> i've got . <EOS> o okay , <EOS> hold on . <EOS>
okay , yep . <EOS> so <EOS> we have the three birds , <EOS> we have the design , <EOS> that <EOS> we have the the fancy bit , <EOS> right , <EOS> the voice recognition's fancy , <EOS> it's cool , <EOS> it's different , <EOS> it's radical , <EOS> so , <EOS> and then we have an extra bit <EOS> i don't remember <EOS> so <EOS> i'm pretty sure people will buy the remote , <EOS> but is it practical to have a voice recognition system in a remote control , <EOS> i think is a big question . <EOS> um , will people will people be willing to wait for the the period that it'll take to train the remote , <EOS> 'cause i think it will the remote will uh get better over time with the same user user , <EOS> but for the first week or for the first two weeks are you willing to wait , <EOS> are you willing to have a bad remote control . <EOS> and uh what if you have visitors come round , <EOS> they stay the night , <EOS> they wanna use the t_v_ , they can't use the remote <EOS> because they speak differently to you . <EOS> um , how do you account for regional accents and stuff like that . <EOS> uh , will people return the remote control , <EOS> i think a lot of young people will buy the remote control , if they have the money , <EOS> you know , so , <EOS> do our audience have the money , <EOS> but would they return it after a while <EOS> because it's not as fast as pressing a button , <EOS> it's not a practical . <EOS> so . <EOS> these are things i think we should consider . <EOS> i think it's cool , <EOS>
right . <EOS> um . <EOS> i think they'll be phasing v_h_s_ out shortly . <EOS> yeah , tivo . <EOS> tivo . <EOS> but it's still there , so <EOS> okay . <EOS> if po if we're gonna do it <EOS> it needs to be compatible 'cause universal remote controls are never universal . <EOS>
so , we're now going to l have the lunch break . <EOS> mm great . <EOS> then we will work again for thirty minutes individual work , <EOS> and um we will uh meet again for the next meeting , <EOS> and uh in this one want to to be more focused on the individual actions the um on the components <EOS> so uh <EOS> you will focus on the component concept um <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah sure , <EOS> look . <EOS> we have different colours . <EOS> so <EOS> the shapes is something between the square shapes with round colo corners and a round shapes ? <EOS> d <EOS> no i don't think , <EOS> i think it's more round than square . <EOS>
no uh we we have uh yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> and button supplements . <EOS> um <EOS> mm no . <EOS> . <EOS> no . <EOS> we don't have <EOS> we're not using any of that . <EOS> no . no ? <EOS> yeah , but what do we ha we have l_c_ display , but but the wh but the s spinning wheel <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> this is fashionable <EOS> with <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so i mean <EOS> the the the basic shape i is is what we uh <EOS> i mean given that we've got you know one one on off button presumably , two buttons for uh channel change and one slider and basically nothing else , <EOS> um w we need to decide on the just the basic shape of the thing . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> use to find it needs to be something that you don't lose , you were saying whistling , <EOS> maybe on the t_v_ you could put like a pack on the t_v_ or something <EOS> so you can't see the remote , you go and press the button on top of the t_v_ and it beeps <EOS> and you're like oh okay it's over there , something like that , <EOS> but that's that sounds a lot cheaper to me . <EOS>
we're marketing to guys as much as we are to women . <EOS> um . <EOS> they don't look at themselves ? <EOS> just a thought . <EOS> well it's a remote control , <EOS> you were sitting watching t_v_ are you gonna want to sort of open it and say oh shit i should go and have a shower and do my hair before i put the t_ <EOS>
yeah . yeah . <EOS> yeah , th you have the vocal commands . <EOS> uh it's k <EOS> on off , yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> on off . <EOS> yeah , but it has to be on to recognise fas <EOS> most of the time you have the <EOS> yeah it's a sleeping remote control . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> it says a <EOS> yeah , the blue one uh spongy . <EOS> mm , i see , yes okay . good . <EOS> okay so <EOS> the average of that is three six nine divided by five , so five just add it . <EOS> you know . <EOS> three , six , seven . <EOS>
yeah , <EOS> why don't you just c , i think just clip on clip <EOS> do you have a belt ? <EOS> clip . <EOS> mm . <EOS> or put 'em in your pocket , yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay . so my favourite animal <EOS> yeah , <EOS> what's your favourite animal ? <EOS>
okay , <EOS> that's good point . <EOS> so <EOS> in the information that you've been supplied , how feasible would you say that the idea of using an l_c_d_ looks ? <EOS> um i think we can do it if uh we use conventional batteries and not have solar cells or kinetic . <EOS> um and then maybe use single curved uh case . <EOS> because we might need it to be curved for the uh thumb to use the joyst joystick easily . <EOS> um and then you'll need the advanced chip obviously for the l_c_d_ . <EOS>
uh we could possibly put an l_ a sort of a l_c_d_ menu in , <EOS> but that again is probably an expense that <EOS> but just thinking um people probably <EOS> i mean you don't have <EOS> you only have to probably tune in the t_v_ once , <EOS> but you have to be able to tune it that once . <EOS> so and if finally the t_v_ breaks , you get a new one , you're gonna have to be able to tune it . <EOS> you can't really avoid that . <EOS> except the new digital markets which do it by themselves . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> i guess i should save this i suppose , huh ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> oops . <EOS> uh-huh huh huh . <EOS> on the desktop . <EOS> i just tried that . <EOS> my documents , computer . <EOS> my compu ah oh here it is , yes . <EOS>
yeah , <EOS> have some have some . <EOS> mm . <EOS> i cou . <EOS> okay . <EOS> so , evaluation . <EOS> we're gonna do it all together <EOS> so we evaluate each criteria . <EOS> i've got the criterias . <EOS> and we have to do it on a scale of one to seven , <EOS> one being true , so it's it's more like it's fits the criteria , <EOS> and seven being as in it doesn't fit the criteria . <EOS> and the criterias are , <EOS> and i'll draw this up on the board <EOS> so we have a box <EOS> . <EOS> and this is false , <EOS> this is just like to keep you informed . <EOS> so seven's here and one's here and then you've got in the middle . <EOS> so the first criteria . <EOS> do you all get what we're doing ? <EOS> okay , cool . <EOS> okay , first criteria , look and feel . <EOS> so the does remote look and feel fashionable to what we talked about ? <EOS> as it is it colour-wise and is it spongy ? <EOS> so what mark should we give for that ? <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> that was great . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> amount of buttons . <EOS> like the amount of buttons , <EOS> 'cause people like a lot le like <EOS> contains only the necessary buttons . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so it's a one ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
oh <EOS> not <EOS> well <EOS> . <EOS> so , 'kay . <EOS> twenty minutes ? <EOS> would you ? <EOS> by the <EOS> perhaps you can save this one , <EOS> and then copy or something . <EOS> add it copy page . <EOS> select all . <EOS> no , <EOS> but you c <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
oh , so y you want our um powerpoint presentations in there , hey ? <EOS> yeah , <EOS> that would be great . <EOS> okay . <EOS> oh so so we'll just put them i there , <EOS> we we yeah , w we won't even okay . <EOS> oh yeah , put them in there . yeah , <EOS> then you don't have to email them . <EOS>
mm . standard deliver . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> no but <EOS> well <EOS> but <EOS> but then you have to to find your other remote control if you want to search . <EOS> that's not <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> th it it's i think that's not <EOS>
mm . <EOS> it's low weight . you have to see yeah yeah the the components we put inside is very low weight . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so the the cost is actually a bit more , <EOS> it's uh it's it's sixteen francs . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> to express them mm mm <EOS> no . <EOS> mm . i guess it was a fairly small group , <EOS> so all of us got to express our opinions , yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> . <EOS> new ideas found . <EOS> not quite sure what about . <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
uh where , l_c_ <EOS> because of the budget , yeah . yep . <EOS> okay <EOS> w we now we can just uh <EOS> so <EOS> are we basically back to the original one now , back to the first version ? <EOS> which turns out to be on budget exactly , pretty much .
mm . <EOS> let's change millenniums . <EOS> so <EOS> maybe you can use in the end and <EOS> yeah . <EOS> doesn't make sense . <EOS> this is very ugly . <EOS> really ? <EOS> i thought you like it . <EOS> ah okay <EOS> just press the button , please uh . <EOS>
inspired by the latest interior and clothing fashion . <EOS> w we could . <EOS> what colour were we gonna make it ? <EOS> put a leopard print on it . <EOS> well <EOS> i i i would sa i would say give a s give a selection of colours . <EOS> um we went with yellow we went with yellow for the prototype <EOS> 'cause we had yellow . <EOS> if i were buying one , i'd go for purple . <EOS> leopard print would be cool . <EOS>
mm-hmm . yeah . <EOS> ye ye yeah . <EOS> children proof . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> so she likes uh buttons which make click , <EOS> so it has to click . <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah , pret <EOS> so they have to be waterproof maybe ? <EOS> 'cause they eat she ate it . <EOS>
yeah okay . <EOS> but uh the position of course can be different . <EOS> it's s <EOS> we have to look uh what's easy to use , and how it's easier to use . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so we can uh switch these to <EOS> i dunno if it l will look good , if you put those on t on the bottom half . <EOS>
they're more expensive though , too . <EOS> mm . <EOS> that's a good point . <EOS> thoughts anybody ? <EOS> as long as we sell it with it . <EOS> well , how about a initial , you get one battery when you buy it , <EOS> 'cause i'm pretty sure we can get them pretty cheap on bulk . <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
okay . 'kay <EOS> sounds like we've had a good little discussion for our first ideas . <EOS> mind if we move on ? <EOS> ps <EOS> mm okay . <EOS> um now our next meeting starts in thirty minutes . <EOS> i believe we've actually been only working on this this one for about twenty , <EOS> so we can continue discussing more new ideas if you'd like um , <EOS>
good luck . <EOS> uh this is going to be <EOS> they're not just like a big round body <EOS> and then some really skinny legs <EOS> and then just some horns . <EOS> yeah , that'll do . <EOS> okay , so let let me draw the body first . <EOS>
come on . <EOS> okay , yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> yep . <EOS> okay . <EOS> no more chit-chat . <EOS> oh you gotta finish <EOS> che-che-che-che . <EOS> over there ? <EOS> in your own room ? <EOS> i'm gonna be so lonely . <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
uh yeah . <EOS> i was just wondering if that's the um if fifty percent is normal <EOS> mark-up ? <EOS> b <EOS> yeah . <EOS> um i would think would be more like sixty percent . <EOS> but um let me <EOS> i have two thoughts . <EOS> one hundred , fifty percent . <EOS>
these , yeah . <EOS> we j we stay where we are . <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah , i i i think it's uh uh , yeah . <EOS> no the the the chances might be that there are more people to put in that space . <EOS> yeah i yeah , <EOS> that's one of the the problems . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> um , do we have any functions that um we'd want on it ? <EOS> i mean so far i've got um on and off , um switch the channel up and down , and put the volume up and down . <EOS> um they're just the the very basics you could use for a t_v_ . <EOS>
um yeah . uh <EOS> we can make it um <EOS> mm ? <EOS> that's the top . <EOS> so uh <EOS> this top . <EOS> this down . <EOS> um maybe it's possible to uh make this side like <EOS> um let's see . um <EOS> but now it's <EOS> do you have it upside down <EOS> or <EOS> do you have it <EOS> this that's top ? okay . <EOS>
format ? <EOS> performance ? <EOS> and then you have the the current colour , <EOS> you can change . <EOS> so no red or green . <EOS> and a pen ? <EOS> and uh line uh width . <EOS> i had five . <EOS> tim had <EOS> uh tim , what kinda line width did you have ? <EOS>
marketing expert . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> um , you know . basically , what i did was i went through all the like user requirements and things that we've done and we've worked on and like made a list of them . <EOS> um you know , so that we can evaluate each one and like <EOS> so it was about going back to the start and saying oh yeah , we did manage to do that , or oh no , we really forgot about that . <EOS> okay ? <EOS> cool , <EOS> so these are what they are . <EOS> oh <EOS>
um and uh <EOS> we we , know , we must resist any efforts to uh to try and water that down um . <EOS> and interchangeable case ? <EOS> i i interchangeable case seems to be um um important to the concept . <EOS> um it it should be cheap , you know , if if we avoid any , you know , electrical connections . <EOS> and uh i you know , <EOS> i if we can come up with some way of of allowing people to actually personalise it uh to whatever they want , then uh i mean uh uh this is totally new . <EOS> we d we don't know whether <EOS>
right <EOS> . mm-hmm . <EOS> right . the alternative is to have a an on-screen display on your television that you control through your remote control . uh <EOS> a bit like a bit like how they have these um digital boxes <EOS> where you you press the buttons <EOS> and it comes up with your this thing of watch lo what's on each channel . <EOS> i mean that that's also a good idea . <EOS> it's <EOS> it can it does have it's problems as well , <EOS> if you've got a small t_v_ and you're sitting on the other side of a room , it's hard to read the little text that comes up . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> um a way to find out uh what people use is maybe just to use uh questionnaires on the internet <EOS> or just ask some random people , elderly people what they use , what they want on a remote control <EOS> yeah . <EOS> to find out . <EOS> but there is already in a one done . <EOS> of functions i could think of . uh volume , channels , the the basic according to . just one two three etcetera . uh text service options . um basic on-off . <EOS> and i found an uh <EOS> could i think of favourites ? <EOS> i always look up the same um pages on text <EOS> and always have to click the number . <EOS> but if you could make a new option , that you just have to press one button <EOS> and you get on your <EOS>
and i'm a marketing person . <EOS> i wanna figure out how to sell them . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> and your name is ? <EOS> my name is eileen . <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah . uh i'm jeanne-oui . <EOS> um uh my role is industrial designer <EOS> and my responsibilities are uh uh um deal with the technical-functional designs <EOS> and specifications of user interface and dealing with user interface design . <EOS>
yeah , a simple pushbuttons . <EOS> okay . <EOS> simple push button . <EOS> did everyone get this on the speech recognition ? <EOS> the um <EOS> it was basically what we said before , <EOS> the idea that you record in a set message , <EOS> and then it picks up that message um and replies to you . <EOS> so it is basically the concept we discussed before . <EOS> um but then we don't know for sure whether it would require a more complicated circuit board . <EOS> i'm guessing it would , <EOS> but got like the definite information . <EOS> maybe we should go on what we're certain of rather than <EOS>
uh , making a profit of fifty million euros . <EOS> so , it's go gonna have to be be pretty damn trendy . <EOS> alright <EOS> so twenty five . <EOS> mm 'kay . <EOS> so yeah , <EOS> i've <EOS> the only the only remote controls i've used usually come with the television , <EOS> and they're fairly basic . <EOS> so uh <EOS>
because uh maybe your hand is in the way , if you have the display here . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> it's more logical to have it on top as well <EOS> because , like on your mobile phone , it's always above . <EOS> i think i <EOS>
i don't know whether that's possible uh in the given time <EOS> but a as far as possible . <EOS> mm . <EOS> so uh <EOS> you two will be together w working on a o on two prototypes <EOS> okay . yep . <EOS> exactly . <EOS> mm . <EOS>
tasks . <EOS> and they are small . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> o on the right i tried to play with the problem is that uh if i have hundred channels i have uh i have to choo press the other button to choose the hundred channels and i have to compose the number <EOS> so it's very lousy . <EOS> so you so you move to the next the next one . <EOS>
so <EOS> so that mean w w we need an in an extra internet connection to use the remote control , if you want to browse , in addition to the t_v_ , or uh or it should be a special t_v_ connected to <EOS> but <EOS> yeah . <EOS> well i i think if we're gonna i think we would definitely need the internet connection <EOS> because even with y i don't think you could even get teletext information from the t_v_ onto the remote control , especially if we don't control the t_v_ . <EOS> i dunno . <EOS> we need to find that out . <EOS>
uh uh four . <EOS> three if we're being generous , i feel . <EOS> three . i think we can do three . <EOS> three . <EOS> th the special colour doesn't would i think make a difference . <EOS> it makes it stand out <EOS> from <EOS> you know <EOS> it's lost in a big pile of crap , it stands out from the rest of the crap . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> uh-huh . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> th okay , the basic thing is there's a user interface <EOS> where people punch a button or talk into it or smile to it or blink their eyes , whatever . <EOS> you know , and that um picks up an input from a user , <EOS> um uh a logic <EOS> a series of logic has to decide what the user is telling the device , <EOS> and the device has to r you know , based on you push button a_ , so i will do something with button a_ . <EOS> so maybe button a_ is the power button , okay . <EOS> um and then it needs to be able to send the signal out to the device itself <EOS> which is the receiver here . <EOS> um and i think that's about it in terms of my design um . <EOS> it's fairly general , <EOS> um and i guess the purpose of this is also not to restrict you in in the way you're thinking , <EOS> like um voice recognition , right , <EOS> um , <EOS> if it's something which is important then we just add more power <EOS> rather than having a thing that we don't have enough power . <EOS> so it's not really a constraint in that sense , <EOS> but i mean these are functionally , you know , the base , <EOS> what the technology has to do . <EOS> um so i guess the rest of it <EOS> i think we should <EOS> maybe you you wanna go back to what the functions are ? <EOS> i think that's more relevant to a discussion ? <EOS>
so , <EOS> without th further ado , whoever wants to go first is free to . <EOS> alright nathan , <EOS> take it away . <EOS> i'll go first . <EOS> go ahead . <EOS> it is nathan right ? <EOS> i'm not calling you the wrong name over and over again ? <EOS> good . <EOS>
so <EOS> i know . <EOS> but maybe <EOS> well <EOS> we don't have to make it red . <EOS> maybe integrate it in the design as well . <EOS> you have to <EOS> the whole the whole uh remote control becomes uh green if you press the buttons . <EOS> uh that's cool . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> havi having said that though , if you wanna get one of those the the ones on the market at the moment they're s they're about twenty pounds anyway . <EOS> so , it'd still be <EOS> yeah , <EOS> we had to buy one . <EOS> right . <EOS>
yeah , <EOS> one other little thing . <EOS> thought it might be handy to put a battery status display on it . <EOS> so you can see <EOS> that's a <EOS> battery stays . <EOS> okay , yeah . <EOS> how much is left in the battery . <EOS> but they'll also really drag up the production costs , <EOS> so think we'll have to see about that too . <EOS>
cel celebration yes , yes . <EOS> ah . <EOS> so i i thank you all very much . <EOS> um , i think this was very good <EOS> and um <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i think we did come up with a new product that's uh feasible . <EOS> feasible from the production point of view and feasible from a marketing point of view . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> 'kay there's the mic . <EOS> so it can be sort of held and w <EOS> we really need really gonna need to hold it , if it's gonna be voice recognition . <EOS> that's cool . <EOS> um n well we can <EOS> whoops . <EOS> oops . <EOS> um . <EOS>
which w <EOS> here you see one that's very round . <EOS> oh yeah , okay . <EOS> so <EOS> i think that can be all kind of shapes . <EOS> but maybe you can just round up the corners a bit . <EOS> of the remote control ? <EOS> that's all . <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
i mean there's al there's also remote controls i remember that that worked uh , this hasn't been done in a while i think , but th as a as a watch . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> there is remote control watches um , <EOS> but i think they're a sorta eighties thing , <EOS> so it might not be easy to market in it <EOS> uh but the the technologies came along and it might be cheaper to make now . <EOS> those things may have been inexpensive for all i know . <EOS>
uh . <EOS> 'kay . <EOS> can you maybe fix the other <EOS> yeah . <EOS> if you press like this not like this <EOS> then you <EOS> mm . <EOS> no <EOS> that's the <EOS> ink's dried . <EOS> no . <EOS> c can you get the batteries ? <EOS> no no <EOS> the battery has fallen down , <EOS> that's i <EOS>
don't t_v_ , yeah . <EOS> now , talking about the target group which is in a sense everybody , <EOS> but i think within the target group we have subgroups . <EOS> we have <EOS> we have earlier it was mentioned about um for example elderly people who have limited function with their fingers and hands , <EOS> so i think that's uh one group that's certainly important . <EOS> um then we have just the nervous people who can never press a little button on anything um unless it's really very clear . <EOS> and uh i don't know how much we want to cater to children's use . <EOS> i mean that's a question um whether that's important that children can really use it or not . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> um <EOS> i think <EOS> yeah , it did . <EOS> it had all the basic buttons that they needed as well as the uh new technology that people said they wanted . <EOS> um so . <EOS> does it work ? <EOS> yeah . so . <EOS>
uh <EOS> because uh that is really innovative , <EOS> and for now and another innovation we have is simplicity <EOS> and simplicity , few buttons , we've uh a lot of functionalities . <EOS> with lot of functionalities . <EOS> so that is uh that is uh for both th <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> the information uh was sometimes uh a little bit too late <EOS> or <EOS> little bit uh lo yeah . too late <EOS> it it it took a lot of time before you got your ema <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> you just sit there for ten minutes . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> where is that email ? <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> um so the que the questions i've given you c could you write that down ? <EOS> true is one and and false is seven . <EOS> and we'll just go through each point together , hopefully . <EOS> um . <EOS> i think if each of us gives an opinion then they can be mixed somehow . <EOS> i dunno how it works exactly , i haven't been told . <EOS>
you know , <EOS> just like right inside there . <EOS> okay cool . <EOS> you have this space here , <EOS> and then you have this thing on the side as well , or at the bottom . <EOS> okay . <EOS> 'cause slogans are usually quite small , right , <EOS> they're not like huge <EOS> so they're s <EOS>
so <EOS> there we go . <EOS> w what's the default colour ? <EOS> white or black ? <EOS> black's probably the normal colour you'd say , <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i quite like that colour that you're fetching there , <EOS> it's uh definitely for <EOS> make it glow in the dark even better . <EOS> so <EOS>
oh okay , <EOS> yeah . <EOS> uh and then uh if you press the op options button , now we have an example of and then you should get the other options with what what you could do <EOS> oh yeah , . <EOS> and that you could do with something like this this . <EOS>
yeah <EOS> so <EOS> yeah . <EOS> on top . <EOS> so <EOS> yeah . <EOS> oh <EOS> maybe you should just s start on a blank page . <EOS> . so <EOS> then we get <EOS> yeah . <EOS> here's <EOS> that's the curve . <EOS> five minutes . <EOS>
so <EOS> that's leads us to our little discussion . <EOS> we've got about five or ten minutes left for discussion . <EOS> so <EOS> i'm gonna sit down , i think . <EOS> it's easier . <EOS> i've got a message . <EOS> five minutes . <EOS> okay , <EOS> that's uh good timing . <EOS>
no . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yes <EOS> but then when when he is used to it , i i it is quite easy . <EOS> is quite easy yeah . <EOS> initially there there is a lot of effort , yeah . <EOS> so so i think th three is good . yeah . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> okay . <EOS> um well we've got five minutes before the end of the meeting . <EOS> so uh we have to uh start winding up . <EOS> um is there <EOS> next meeting in thirty minutes . <EOS> 'kay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> so um <EOS> right , so we've got i_d_ the <EOS> come on , <EOS> where's my <EOS>
what do you have in short cut ? <EOS> go up . <EOS> participant two . <EOS> yeah go up . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> again . <EOS> no . <EOS> go back . <EOS> you have no <EOS> uh maybe messenger ami . <EOS> messenger . <EOS> over . <EOS> okay . <EOS>
right . <EOS> we don't have the money to do it towards t f technology <EOS> so we should we should aim at design . <EOS> yeah . yeah . <EOS> okay . have to do you have to do it in the box ? <EOS> okay well , so so that's up to you then <EOS> to to make this box in something that's absolutely extraordinary . <EOS>
woah . <EOS> why adjustable ? <EOS> all all buttons ? <EOS> yeah ? or not . <EOS> no uh <EOS> okay . <EOS> that's how we are going to make it uh more trendy . <EOS> or is it uh too expensive ? <EOS> but maybe i mean they have to they have to have some colour right ? <EOS> and if the background is very dark blue <EOS>
okay , well , so <EOS> we have s mm uh broad audience . <EOS> isn't that isn't true anymore . <EOS> but um we have elderly people , <EOS> so we need to keep it simple . <EOS> uh the way i want to keep it simple is to use the sen uh standard . so standardised uh methods like uh on all uh remote controls . <EOS> not too full , <EOS> like uh jens already said , only ten percent is being used . <EOS>
so um there's a pretty wide range of uh remote controls these days <EOS> and and uh this remote control on the right here is is one of the more extravagant , <EOS> but it's not really <EOS> it's by no means uh mm you know on it's own in being so expensive . <EOS> there are a lot of expensive remote controls out there . <EOS> so <EOS> yeah it doe <EOS> it's <EOS> well basically all the functions uh are controlled through through the l_c_d_ screen <EOS> except for the really really kind of main functions , which have a couple of of their own buttons . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> ca l we are just <EOS> when we just want to uh to cut the number of buttons we have to make seven to to fit in in twelve twelve fifty . <EOS> but <EOS> so is it possible ? <EOS> but that's seven basic buttons right , seven buttons without any adds-on , without special colours or form or material .
you know yourself . <EOS> so just to summarise the most important things which came out of the remote control market investigation . <EOS> the most important thing was that the thing sort of look and felt fancy rather than just functional . <EOS> and second , there should be some technological innovation . <EOS> and then third and l less important than the other two , there should be an ease of use as well . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> we don't have charger . <EOS> so if you uh sum up uh everything wi with the l_c_d_ , which costs two dollar , you have two plus four plus four plus two plus two . <EOS> i think we can use excel . <EOS> it's about <EOS> so the total cost if you if you want all the fuct functionalities will be about uh fifteen dollars . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> well <EOS> we can try to make it special . <EOS> so <EOS> do you have any ideas how it has to look for for usability <EOS> or user <EOS> well <EOS> well <EOS> i th i thought about um making it the same uh style as the television , <EOS> we don't have uh the same television uh all the time , <EOS> so uh that's no matter . <EOS> um if we uh control the v_c_r_ and the d_v_d_ player player with it uh it has to be clear , <EOS> because uh kids and uh elderly are gonna use it , <EOS> so uh <EOS> it's not only for the uh technical persons . <EOS> um i think it must be a very good control , <EOS> so you can uh uh uh act uh use it from uh everywhere in your room , <EOS> the the infrared uh thing must be from very good quality . <EOS>
yeah <EOS> also thinking , <EOS> i think both uh if we had a budget of twenty twenty uh euros , it will be okay , <EOS> sorry . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> but uh . <EOS> well <EOS> maybe we need specific costings then . <EOS> actually <EOS> do maybe two designs <EOS> and then cost them out <EOS> and see which one is gonna fit in our budget better . <EOS>
it's actually important to note that the television , uh you know if there's an earthquake or anything like that , that i it actually is edible inside . <EOS> fact , <EOS> i dunno if you noticed , <EOS> but i wrote the uh the company's name on the telephone screen , <EOS> i thought that was kinda nice . <EOS> this was actually an apple on the inside . <EOS> this <EOS>
or can move between positions in the in the number . <EOS> that's right . <EOS> and what about people who want to use digits ? <EOS> butto real buttons ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> wow . <EOS> yeah . so there was there was a constraint that the surface area which we have on this banana on one side because of the shape . <EOS>
right . <EOS> that's what we have there . <EOS> that's plastic . <EOS> plastic covered with rubber . <EOS> we might uh add some more underneath here . <EOS> maybe give it , give it a form . <EOS> i mean you're supposed to hold it like that , <EOS> but um just if you grab it , take it from somewhere , <EOS> so yeah , <EOS> you have some rub yeah . <EOS> exactly , <EOS> use both . <EOS> might as well think about <EOS>
so <EOS> yeah yeah . sure sure . <EOS> so maybe we can jump to your presentations , right now . <EOS> okay so let's keep in mind about tha that that this last point about l_c_d_ and speech uh reco <EOS> yep . okay . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i think even even if it was within budget do a speech reco rec system it might be a bit difficult <EOS> because if you think if you're watching t_v_ you're gonna have a lot of this uh background noise from the t_v_ which might interfere with the <EOS>
um i've had word down from head office that something that we should be centred well , something we should take into account is um we've gotta keep the corporate image within this remote control unit . <EOS> it's gotta d look like it's in the r_ and r_ . <EOS>
yeah , well . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah <EOS> but that that's uh but uh <EOS> no <EOS> the the the overall uh the overall concept is uh <EOS> yeah yeah , <EOS> no no , <EOS> i mean that's these uh <EOS> yeah , <EOS> just kind of <EOS> or just make it little . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> um okay , <EOS> d <EOS> we're all clear where we go from here . <EOS> yep . <EOS> yep , <EOS> sounds good . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> okay , so <EOS> thank you very much indeed <EOS> and i'll s see you all again in thirty minutes . <EOS>
but <EOS> right . right . <EOS> okay so <EOS> right , <EOS> so in function one of the priorities might be to combine as many uses <EOS> yeah . <EOS> right , so do you think that should be like a main design aim of our remote control d you know , <EOS> do your your satellite and your regular telly and your v_c_r_ and everything ? <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> alright <EOS> let's just go over the agenda real quick for this meeting . <EOS> see if i can't get things uh moving along here a little bit better . <EOS> um i'll go over what we went over last time , <EOS> which shouldn't take long . <EOS>
um . <EOS> uh no , i think that's us our discussion over <EOS> unless anybody's got questions or confusions , <EOS> 'cause i'm confused . <EOS> no i'm good . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> excuse me . <EOS> huh ? <EOS> okay . <EOS> um uh we'll probably get questionnaire in a minute , <EOS> it's a <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> rechargeable . <EOS> mm . <EOS> . what's chip on print ? <EOS> what's <EOS> um . <EOS> hmm ? <EOS> sorry , never mind . <EOS> uh th the uh <EOS> the electronics um , basically the more features we add um <EOS> oops , this one . <EOS> so the more features we add the fancier chips we need to buy and put in , <EOS> which adds to the cost as you can expect . <EOS> um . <EOS>
you still want me the presentation . <EOS> and uh also as uh i understood , and uh i think it was a part of uh bob , uh uh presentation , people prefer to have uh to have uh the remote control with less button . <EOS> so for the electronic part , working and interfacing , with button , we should we should try to t try to design a remote control having uh some some simpler buttons <EOS> or some rolling buttons to just to just to search between different options , <EOS> and showing o something on t_v_ and putting less lesser stuff on the uh on the remote control . <EOS>
uh i think so , <EOS> we we we talked about the the individual roles that we each had as well . <EOS> did i miss something ? <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i'm afraid i incorporated that when i said who was present , <EOS> but yes , we did , <EOS> and we did a little bit of uh team building of uh of making the pictures , <EOS> but i didn't think those were appropriate to the minutes necessarily . <EOS> so um <EOS> as a group i think we've are they're accepting the minutes . <EOS>
yeah , <EOS> i dunno . <EOS> that i thi <EOS> i thought that would be under yours . <EOS> or or is white and black , then two more or <EOS> uh . i guess it's three , <EOS> three <EOS> three . <EOS> we'll just say three . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> maybe the r_r_ will be in colour as well , <EOS> so yeah . <EOS> interface , <EOS> we're doing push buttons . <EOS> and how many buttons do we have ? <EOS>
so in the living room <EOS> but that that's an open question <EOS> whether it's a it's a it's a it <EOS> at the origin it was supposed to be a f pure reading room for relaxing , uh reading the newspapers , et cetera , et cetera . <EOS> uh there has been a very long discussion about that . <EOS> i stinct uh this discussion is still vivid , that some of the people , i bel belong to these people , would like to have a mixed room where you can have a reading room for sure , but also meeting room if necessary . <EOS> or , as uh susan said , a room an emergency room where you can put uh some visitors in a decent environment for for for for work , <EOS> because you don't have any other place to do it . <EOS> but that's that's really an open discussion <EOS> and that d i think no decision , no final decision has been taken about that . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> i think we could've done even better with a little bit more information , <EOS> like what's a single-curved case , <EOS> how many colours , <EOS> what do colours count <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> things , <EOS> but given given what we had i think that we did we did really well . <EOS> um i think we worked together pretty well . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> what uh what uh do you want to discuss ? <EOS> uh <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> we should get started . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yep . <EOS> uh i'm taking notes . um <EOS> okay . <EOS> great . <EOS> we each have a specific task , <EOS> as i saw in my mail . <EOS> i didn't know if you received the same mail . <EOS> yeah ? <EOS> okay so the um uh <EOS> this industrati industrial designer should produce a working design . <EOS> am i correct ? <EOS>
i think if we we do both the obviously production costs are going to go way up <EOS> um but it does put it into it'd become the rolls royce of remote controls basically . <EOS> it would be very nice . <EOS> pretty much . <EOS> i mean we we have to r reflect back on what our market research did say . <EOS>
and menu maybe . <EOS> oh yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> so like if we had that <EOS> yeah . <EOS> but s yeah uh . <EOS> but d_v_d_ players usually have their own remote . <EOS> that's true , yeah . <EOS> so , i know i'm not c really clear on what <EOS>
yes . <EOS> oops . <EOS> yes . <EOS> okay . <EOS> um and after the meeting there'll be things to be done <EOS> and as you can see it says we get to get lunch , um and then some more individual work and then putting minutes away and individual actions . <EOS> um but uh now <EOS> for the minutes of the first meeting . <EOS> and go to that one . <EOS> um as you can see it was this earlier today . <EOS> um kate , steph , sarah and myself in our four capacities were present . <EOS> i opened the meeting , <EOS> the product was developed uh and reviewed , <EOS> and we talked about the financial end of it . <EOS> um and it had some implications , um the four million sales target and new ideas of not too many buttons , bright colours and some of the influence of the japanese . <EOS> and we closed early <EOS> so you could then proceed with your research and getting your reports together for tod this meeting <EOS> anybody have any questions on those minutes ? <EOS> are they complete , <EOS> did they discuss everything that we covered last time ? <EOS> 'kay . <EOS>
but it's it's it's <EOS> something to bear in mind is that if we put a display on the remote control the c uh communication is one way , <EOS> so you can't have the televisions and information back to the remote control , at least i don't think you can . <EOS> um i'm not sure . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> that's the design of the the the layout of the uh electronic design , <EOS> but um obviously there'll be more details once we've decided what we're putting on the user interface . <EOS> so , <EOS> that'll be decided , i guess . <EOS> okay . <EOS>
make it make it a two . <EOS> one two three . <EOS> or make it uh a fucking two . <EOS> you can see the remote control is r_ and r_ . <EOS> right . <EOS> yeah , there's r_ and r_ in front . <EOS> uh it's not the colour , <EOS> so maybe you should make two , <EOS> but it has r_ and r_ . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> i support an apple . <EOS> and the mm the material is expected to be spongy . <EOS> uh i don't know which material can be spongy , <EOS> and if you <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i think it's innovative to use the mm the wheel because i think no one else has . <EOS> has it ? <EOS>
this one ? <EOS> six hundred . no , <EOS> i yeah . <EOS> no <EOS> that uh is one thousand twenty four . <EOS> i think eight hundred six hundred is better . <EOS> this one ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> if it browse . <EOS> nah , name . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> i i am really into the idea of kinetic batteries now after reading about them . <EOS> that was <EOS> etcetera . <EOS> oh , <EOS> i'm so excited . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> i didn't even know they existed . <EOS> i i knew you can get watches that had them , like really quite expensive watches <EOS> that just never need a battery , <EOS> 'cause you're always moving your wrist . <EOS>
w we might have uh we might have lost that granola market again <EOS> that we're <EOS> um yeah , <EOS> i was just <EOS> go on . <EOS> i know . <EOS> well <EOS> they don't own tellys anyway <EOS> do they ? <EOS> i guess that's true . <EOS>
adjusting . <EOS> here we are . <EOS> the cable might be a little loose or something . <EOS> oh , you got it . <EOS> oh . is it on ? <EOS> okay right here we are . <EOS> we're here . <EOS> okay , um . <EOS> in order to see what the functional requirements were to be found , um <EOS>
y <EOS> oh really ? <EOS> just start summarising now . <EOS> you can reply to the same message . <EOS> i haven't got message . <EOS> see summary , there . if you just reply to that one . <EOS> we haven't got the five minute left thing yet . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> okay <EOS> you're the designer , of course you wanna give it a one . <EOS> um and then how about how we doing on colour ? <EOS> colour uh i <EOS> colour , i gave it a one . <EOS> i really like all those nice bright , warm colours . <EOS>
yeah i suppose , <EOS> where you you keep the remote hidden under the sofa most of the time . <EOS> i if it <EOS> it's uh in in the house , isn't it , <EOS> i suppose . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i think <EOS> so don't change case . <EOS> change case colour . <EOS> and we're sort of saying no to that . <EOS>
but i think that , you know , switching from one country to to another will be a problem , <EOS> so although y y <EOS> well , <EOS> if you do language adaptation , there should be no problem . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> i dunno . <EOS> yeah <EOS> but i i <EOS>
no <EOS> you just tap i think . <EOS> yeah , you tap . <EOS> touch screen , <EOS> yeah <EOS> then it's turn turn off , turn on . <EOS> just tap it . <EOS> tap the thing . okay . <EOS> and then the television is on also , <EOS> or just the remote ? <EOS> sure .
you can start . <EOS> you have uh powerpoint ? <EOS> ah yeah maybe there . <EOS> okay . <EOS> who are you ? <EOS> um at three i think . <EOS> no ? <EOS> mm . <EOS> ouch . <EOS> and <EOS> okay . <EOS> we have a technical problem uh . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> uh the powerstick . <EOS> powerstick , yeah . <EOS> what else ? <EOS> what else ? <EOS> uh . <EOS> maybe a spanish name would work well . <EOS> especially if we're selling into the u_s_ market becasue there's a lot of spanish speakers there . <EOS>
yep . <EOS> right . <EOS> first of all the functional design objectives . <EOS> uh we need to keep in mind the user requirement specification , what needs and desires are to be fulfilled , the functions design , what effects the apparatus should have , and the working design , how the apparatus actually works to fulfil its function . <EOS>
well , it's a bit difficult to say , <EOS> because um in fact we have some constraints in terms of furniture . <EOS> uh they are here . <EOS> so um well , your your person your your question actually is answered maybe by the third item . <EOS> so each person should get um , well , it's a sort of desk , <EOS> it's made of two pieces <EOS> and it looks like a corner . <EOS> with , of course , a chair . <EOS> uh a filing cabinet that goes under the desk uh <EOS> and , well , we can put hanging shelves over the the desks . <EOS> so i'm not really sure it's possible to get three um three desks in a two person office . <EOS> but um we could try . <EOS> what's what should be said here , <EOS> i don't know if , well , you <EOS> i i will maybe distribute now documents if you don't have them . <EOS> maybe it's easier . <EOS> do you need something , martin ? <EOS> um , i can keep this for you . <EOS> uh so it's it's <EOS> yeah , <EOS> you have a copy , susan . <EOS> you too david , i think . <EOS> so in fact there are more places than people , <EOS> so we won't be that constrained . <EOS> uh as you know some of us and some of you here actually , martin and david are part-time . <EOS> so it it's for the moment quite comfortable . <EOS> normally we should even get an extra uh an extra place for , you know , temporary people coming to work on uh on projects . <EOS> uh yeah , i uh yeah , <EOS> i counted so we have um fifteen pers physical persons <EOS> and about uh sixteen , i think , uh persons oh , actually , eighteen persons in the offices . <EOS>
oh yes i see him , good yes . <EOS> okay . <EOS> . <EOS> no . <EOS> so <EOS> 'kay . <EOS> okay it should've gone through to you . <EOS> okay mm yes i have it . <EOS> mm-hmm . okay so this is just a presentation on uh the trends that we're gonna use to make the product stand out from the rest of the products out there at the moment . <EOS> um can i just put this on ? <EOS> so <EOS> we have to work out a way what we can do with our product to make it stand out and make it so people wanna buy it . <EOS> um . this is to do this i will not remove my microphone . <EOS> we basically used um some focus group surveys <EOS> which i went through with you last time , the main results of that , <EOS> and um some research on the current design um and fashion trends that are out there at the moment um , <EOS> and as part of this <EOS>
uh f i think first of all we have to see uh it is possible to introduce kinetic energy in our budget , i think . <EOS> yes <EOS> w <EOS> there there are four options . <EOS> we could use the basic normal battery . <EOS> uh a hand dynamo . <EOS> but i don't think that's really an option . <EOS> you don't wanna swing before you can watch television . <EOS> uh solar cells . <EOS> but not every room is very light <EOS> so it's not a very good option . <EOS> or the kinetic energy . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> it's been a little bit difficult to um make sure that it's hand-holdable , <EOS> and that the user can use it , you know , it's not too big . <EOS> uh but we think that this you know , this size will be okay <EOS> and we will have to fit the battery case in there somehow . <EOS>
the without without the charger <EOS> it's about uh well two dollars to produce uh the microphone and speech recognition systems . <EOS> with the charger ? <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> two dollars for the uh for the add-on modules , <EOS> and finally three dollars for the charger . <EOS>
we're <EOS> maybe we can <EOS> yeah , i would say mayb maybe a couple of colours like uh like a black with with yellow and somewhere , <EOS> like maybe the r_r_ can be yellow , or something like that . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . okay . okey-dokey . <EOS> yeah , i don't have any other questions on this . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> okay , <EOS> one question ? <EOS> oh . <EOS> she didn't know who . <EOS> okay , <EOS> no , <EOS> no problem . <EOS> no problem . okay . <EOS> okay <EOS> we're still going . <EOS> okay , well <EOS> i expect everything will be much clearer with the instructions we will receive uh shortly . <EOS> okay well uh <EOS> see you all in about thirty minutes , then . <EOS> thank you very much . <EOS>
so maybe we can start with uh industrial design . <EOS> so this is the presentation . <EOS> uh , i_d_ you want ? <EOS> maybe i can switch slide uh on your request . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i only v have three slides , so . <EOS> i just look at the mm um just this . on some web pages to find some documentation <EOS> and i think a remote control is , as i s mentioned previously , <EOS>
and too expensive . <EOS> ah . <EOS> mm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> i thought it could be only a screen which would change depending on uh uh the use or even the user . <EOS> so ma i prefer to have the off button at the top right , <EOS> so i would have my own design of the remote control <EOS> because it's in fact just a a full touch screen remote control , <EOS> if you if you like . <EOS>
session ? yeah . <EOS> because then we have a <EOS> after that we are going to the conceptual uh <EOS> yeah . <EOS> y you do some individual work , <EOS> we have meeting , <EOS> individual work , meeting . <EOS> and at the end of the day we have a final meeting . <EOS> and then i have to prepare uh i have to defend our design , <EOS> so make it good . <EOS> i depend on you . <EOS>
that's that's right , yeah , yeah . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> like they have for mobile phones <EOS> that are just fruits and animal prints and colours . <EOS> yeah , okay . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so uh i so uh okay . um right , <EOS> sorry . <EOS> um we hadn't finished your <EOS>
no , i think it's after after five minutes or something a timer <EOS> i i think , no ? <EOS> yes . <EOS> well i i uh <EOS> but if you're watching t_v_ for two hours , you don't want your t_v_ to turn off after five five minute <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> i hope we can do this . <EOS> something <EOS> there are a lot of options depending uh on what kind of television you got . <EOS> 'cause if you don't got a wide screen television you don't need the uh the screen settings <EOS> uh for uh <EOS>
um i worried about the materials , <EOS> it is <EOS> uh the entire thing is covered in a rubber coating <EOS> so it's very durable uh , <EOS> it's not gonna break like some types of plastic that's dropped . <EOS> um , and of course as you can see <EOS> and if you touch it it does have that nice squishy feel . <EOS>
tech <EOS> like , you want to to change the chair or you want to move to the armchair from the sofa or something , and then the volume changes . <EOS> or you want to go to the kitchen . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> it's easy to do , <EOS> you just control the <EOS>
mm , object tracking . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> and um well <EOS> first thing uh i was uh uh i got an email from uh from my superior again <EOS> that we really should stay within the budget of the uh twelve euro and fifty cents . <EOS> it's uh well he said to me well uh
because um it gets brittle , cracks <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> um <EOS> we want <EOS> we expect these um uh these remote controls to be around for several hundred years . <EOS> so . <EOS> good ex good expression . <EOS> whic <EOS> wow , <EOS> good expression . <EOS> well after us . <EOS>
um so <EOS> we are putting together a new remote control . <EOS> um we want it to be something original . <EOS> um of course we're a not only a electronics company but a <EOS> fashion um conscious electronics company , <EOS> so we want it to be trendy um <EOS> and we want it to be easy to use . <EOS> um we've got the functional design , conceptual design and detailed design <EOS> um which basically is is the three of you um . <EOS> and w uh well um <EOS> functional design um . <EOS>
hmm . <EOS> and as for w w would it be helpful if um i described the components a bit , <EOS> because i think it would give you um maybe bring this discussion back to earth of what we can actually physically do . <EOS> yeah , maybe . <EOS> or <EOS>
jus just the price . <EOS> otherwise i don't care what i put there because it's the chip which i buy or which we buy . <EOS> so um i have to inform you i receive an email from the management bon board today and they have new requirements for the for the remote control . um <EOS>
um , oh we just <EOS> yeah , i agree . <EOS> b_ button and the f_ button , they don't do anything . <EOS> yeah , yeah yeah . yeah . <EOS> you <EOS> what if um may be a little fancy <EOS> but what if it had like a little screen , so it has less buttons but it still has all the functions . <EOS> like the way a mobile phone does . <EOS>
got it . <EOS> yeah . th that looks like it . <EOS> 'kay . <EOS> so basic remote operation runs as follows , <EOS> press button makes connection with the power source and the rest of the circuit , <EOS> chip senses the connection , <EOS> chip produces a morse code infra-red signal , specific to that button . <EOS> so you press the button , it produces uh a signal that's encoded specifically for that button . <EOS> transistors amplify that signal and it goes to the t_v_'s centre , which interprets the signal response accordingly , changes channel etcetera . <EOS> so that being said <EOS> next slide , please . <EOS> findings oh which were the required materials for the basic internal construction , <EOS> so all the really simplistic functions that we just discussed , <EOS> we need rubber for buttons , aluminium for battery y contacts , integrated circuit which consists of a diode , transistor , resonator , resistors , and a capacitator , <EOS> all those basic things that make a circuit function . <EOS> um fibreglass and thin copper wire to create the actual circuit board itself . <EOS> an l_e_d_ , which is a light emitting diode , <EOS> um contact discs for the buttons , plastic for the casing , and a power-source , <EOS> whatever power-source we've actually determined we want . <EOS> next slide , please . <EOS> thank you . <EOS> uh personal preferences , <EOS> uh to save money for the components , the remote should be mass-produced and basic materials should be bought en masse . <EOS> um if we find another company who can produce the required chips , casing , l_e_d_ , any additional materials we decide we require at a less expensive rate than we ourselves are producing , we should go for it . <EOS> next slide , please . <EOS> um just talking to the um manufacturing division . <EOS> they suggested power options , solar cells , hand dynamo , and kinetic power , <EOS> so you shake it and it increases the power . <EOS> um i'm not sure how the hand dynamo works , <EOS> they have yet to get back to me on that . <EOS> so next slide , please . <EOS> suggested casing options . <EOS> okay . <EOS> we can offer options for casing such as straight , curved , double-curved , you know , <EOS> very specific to the customer . <EOS> options for materials , plastic , rubber , titanium , wood . <EOS> i don't think anyone's gonna go for a wood one , because splinters <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> yep . <EOS> to r because th th th the the selling price is already prite fik uh uh quite fixed on twenty five euros <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> so we just have to offer as much as as well value for the for the customer uh he can have for twenty five euro . <EOS>
so . so <EOS> the the main components you see here are the cheapest i have found <EOS> and yeah th you have always a compromise with uh reliability and uh i if it's expensive , <EOS> but uh this one was not <EOS> this one also really uh reliable <EOS> um so
mm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> 'kay . <EOS> uh , what do we think a <EOS> so , <EOS> we're looking for <EOS> 'kay . <EOS> we're <EOS> what do we think a good size would be for this ? <EOS>
um , i don't know if it's a gimmick or not , <EOS> but have any of you ever seen those odd little key rings <EOS> where if you whistle , it will beep and you tell you where it is . <EOS> i had one of those , <EOS> and my brother , and my dad , could have beat me up <EOS> because it it went off all the time accidentally . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yep . <EOS> mm there's a risk of that . <EOS> but anyway that's uh <EOS> okay so we can talk about finance now . <EOS> so i have a little spreadsheet for us <EOS> where <EOS> i i was wondering , you <EOS> when you talked about the fifteen point eight euros , i was wondering how you came up with that figure ? <EOS>
no . <EOS> it's it's <EOS> no , but this is disadvant disadvantage . <EOS> yeah , i think it's a disadvantage . <EOS> it's advantage . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> and mayb maybe we can have the switching mode to pass from you know voice controller to <EOS> yeah , <EOS> but one other question . <EOS> how how much will it cost ? <EOS>
you know , some slider or <EOS> not just two discrete buttons for volume , <EOS> but something which <EOS> okay . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> okay , n <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> is that because the of the discrete volume levels , <EOS> or is that <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> good , good . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so three three there's three buttons on a slider . <EOS> three buttons , channel up channel up down and <EOS> y yes , yes . <EOS> well , <EOS> if you g if you if you got a channel up down , we can have a slider in that as well . <EOS> because if it if you no <EOS> if you notice on the thing it it kind of like has got kind of if you you know it s kind of like sticks , <EOS> if you know what i mean , <EOS> up like one unit , <EOS> if you see what i mean . <EOS> so it kinda goes up one , <EOS> then y like you can keep rolling it up , <EOS> but it's like like like like a cog or something . <EOS> so you kinda take it up one at a time . <EOS>
just just carry on . <EOS> um there are the decisions we have to turn to , <EOS> but we'll come back to them in a minute <EOS> after i take us to the minutes of the previous meeting . <EOS> right um <EOS> as we remember , i opened the meeting , <EOS> the four of us were present , <EOS> the meeting the first meeting's minutes were reviewed <EOS> and approved . <EOS> um sarah , you presented a marketing research report <EOS> um which pretty much rep represented that fifteen to thirty five year olds uh it has to be hand-held , power , channel , volume , number keys , possibly a speech recognition . <EOS> and then steph did a second presentation <EOS> um that those functions plus streamlining them with big user-friendly keys that were easy to use . <EOS> i think all of us agreed with those things . <EOS> kate presented a working design of going after going over the basics on the whiteboard <EOS> um that it should be a simple mass-produced device , because of the twelve and a half pence cost . <EOS> um but we did talk about possibly using rechargeable batteries <EOS> and having a docking place as a selling point . <EOS> um and the new requirements that it for be for t_v_ only <EOS> um and that it include the l so slogan and colour of the uh corporate design be included . um the corporate image . <EOS> so <EOS> we agreed that the target market would be fifteen to thirty five with more money than sense , that were decision makers . <EOS> alternatively it would be a manufacturer to enclose it with the t_v_ , <EOS> but it still should meet those parameters . <EOS> um and that the function we agreed was volume , power , numbers , enter , channels , a way to move between channels , easy to use and hand-held . <EOS> um at that point we agreed that sarah would look at the current cost of competition , what what do the current ones sell for . <EOS> um and steph was gonna look at ec ergonomics . <EOS> kate was gonna look at cost and feasibility of the various possibilities that we discussed . <EOS> and i was to type up these minutes <EOS> and work on the final report . <EOS> is this a fair presentation of what our last meeting was ? <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> i don't know what the rest of my notes mean because they were made for me . <EOS> but if someone <EOS> components concept . question mark . <EOS> energy . question mark . <EOS> was that you ? <EOS> okay . <EOS> oh right right . yeah . <EOS> um , so what d but what do we know about <EOS>
yeah , <EOS> there's that box in uh o of it . <EOS> a pi <EOS> there's that box in the t_v_ , <EOS> so with the set box you you can connect internet with your t_v_ . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> ok <EOS> hm-mm . <EOS> it's it's not so uh popular now . <EOS>
oh i thought we all were . <EOS> yeah , i have one too , okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> . <EOS> s <EOS> yep . <EOS> . <EOS> whoops <EOS> i forgot to put the thing on <EOS> right . i just wanna <EOS> 'cause basically i can't re i've really crap at remembering everyone's name <EOS> so i just wanna rather than going uh miss marketing and miss this and miss that wanted to know your names again . <EOS> just gonna leave this up here <EOS> 'cause i'll you know . so <EOS>
but i've got some pictures here of some leading ones . <EOS> i don't know how to get to them , <EOS> do i press f_ five is it ? escape ? <EOS> uh if you if you escape then you can see your bar . <EOS> oh okay , cool . <EOS> i haven't got my glasses on so i hope it's this one . <EOS> these are two leading um remote controls at the moment . <EOS> you know they're grey , <EOS> they've <EOS> i mean this one's got loads of buttons , <EOS> it's hard to tell from here what they actually do , <EOS> and they don't look very exciting at all . <EOS> um , personally i prefer this one just because it's looks easier use , <EOS> it's a bit more sleek with more of this silver stuff , <EOS> um , but there you go , that's what we're up against , <EOS> and i think we can do much better than that . <EOS>
alright . <EOS> but , <EOS> i don't even know how to play this . <EOS> no . <EOS> press the little presentation . <EOS> it's the um <EOS> it looks like a y_ kind of over there above draw . <EOS> there , that one , <EOS> there you go . <EOS>
right . <EOS> right . <EOS> bu but but the survey did say that f things like voice recognition are more popular with them , <EOS> so if you want to put in something stylish , then uh th it'll certainly be more popular with this i ye with the younger people as compared to older people , <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
i think it's a three . <EOS> a three ? <EOS> and why is that ? <EOS> okay , so <EOS> we have two , two , three . <EOS> i personally think , because i d i don't think i maybe it's easy to use , <EOS> it has to be easy to find right away . <EOS> i i think if you have the button at the right , i don't think you can find the option button that easy . <EOS>
um it's come to my attention the following . <EOS> teletext has become outdated due to the populat popularity of the internet . <EOS> remote control should only be used for the t_v_ . um mm . <EOS> due for uh time to market and possibly also cost issues . um also key is the corporate image should stay recognisable , <EOS> um f uh your colour and slogan of course is down at the bottom there . <EOS> um . now . <EOS> just to say quickly uh i would have thought that only being used for a television the macro facility may now not be required . <EOS> um or at l its functionality would have been of limited use . <EOS> so <EOS> to the point in my opinion anyway that it might not be worth pursuing . <EOS> um if anybody disagrees we can uh definitely say so . <EOS> um and hopefully we'll just crack on and we'll get everything going . <EOS>
yeah <EOS> but i think people want to use a remote with with their fingers <EOS> because th they're used to that <EOS> and <EOS> yeah the fingers , yeah . <EOS> yeah o yeah , if they think it's handy to use a pen . <EOS> yeah <EOS> i think this uh this is a good size for the screen . <EOS> i don't know how how large the actual remote should be <EOS> but a little bit like this , or something . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . depends . <EOS> uh . <EOS> i think the the the volume was usually uh above each other , <EOS> because you go higher and down . <EOS> and the the pay the the <EOS> the program is next to each other , <EOS> because you would go further and back . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so . <EOS> and if you have a touch screen in it , it's definitely too too fragile uh fragile . <EOS> yeah , too fragile . <EOS> yeah <EOS> and a lots uh uh lots of kids use it <EOS> and touchscreen is not uh kids uh <EOS>
okay , <EOS> i have some uh points from marketing point of view . <EOS> um just the standard thing li things like uh intuitive , uh small , fairly cheap . <EOS> uh it's pretty cheap , twenty five euros . <EOS> uh brand independent . um i think , it doesn't have to matter uh which brand your t_v_ or other thing is . um <EOS>
they want everything , but simply . <EOS> okay . <EOS> mm 'kay yes . exactly . <EOS> so we can go to next . <EOS> okay . <EOS> so in milan and paris recently the trends have been showing that clothing , shoes and furniture are basically just covered with fruits and vegetable patterns . <EOS> so i don't know if we want to go with that <EOS> um and also the spongy feel is in in contrast to last year . <EOS> i don't know really , <EOS> i mean i guess the spongy could relate to the buttons if we want to <EOS> rather than like a hard clicky button that you find on like some mobiles and stuff , you'd want like a softer touch . <EOS> i mean do you guys know what i mean . <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
okay this is <EOS> this is an open question for you . <EOS> well this is still is is very bad . <EOS> so , this is the end of this discussion . <EOS> next meeting uh here are the task you have to work on . <EOS> um so you have to work on the component uh concept . <EOS> uh you have to work on user interface , <EOS> and you have to go through a trend watching . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> for controlling the programmes the different channels . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> we have also included two buttons for increasing or decreasing the volume . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> and we have also included two buttons for scrolling up and scrolling down the programme channels . <EOS> mm . <EOS>
yeah . the thing with i see would there not be a <EOS> we'd have to maybe sacrifice the face plates for a touch screen ? <EOS> um i'm not sure that's sincerely correct , <EOS> i think if you kind of take the example of a mobile phone that uh trying to pass a portion of the device is not interchangeable whereas the surrounding portions are interchangeable . <EOS> we could have the casing , the the face plates . <EOS>
yeah , i think that pretty much is it . yeah . mm-hmm . <EOS> okay , <EOS> then we i'm looking for three presentations . <EOS> and uh i don't know whether the order matters much uh , <EOS> i don't i don't think so , <EOS> so whoever w wants <EOS> yeah , okay . <EOS>
is that at least identifiable ? <EOS> snake . <EOS> well , <EOS> snake ? <EOS> it's w <EOS> well . <EOS> it's a whale , yes . <EOS> thanks . <EOS> um and , yeah , <EOS> the reason i like whales is 'cause uh they're well , first of all they're quite intelligent <EOS> um and also they're they're kind of mysterious , <EOS> like we don't really know much about them <EOS> or or understand how they work , <EOS> how they form groups . <EOS> and i just find them interesting animals . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> okay , <EOS> good . <EOS> then we the same . <EOS> thank you . <EOS> that was it . <EOS> okay . <EOS> that's it . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> thanks . <EOS> cool . <EOS> okay . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> uh yeah . <EOS> yeah yeah that that would be fairly simple , <EOS> i mean you'd you'd actually have two separate you'd have two separate circuit boards but they'd be joined by wires or like some cabling between them , <EOS> 'cause in the in the actual flip bit you'd have some linking . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> i think uh n one thing that was lacking uh was that we did not know what the various things cost to begin with . <EOS> um we kap kept a adding things randomly . <EOS> so , had we known <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
okay yeah . <EOS> d <EOS> yeah , alright . yeah . <EOS> and do we use a a uh what's it called ? like a imac , if you can look through it . <EOS> or just a normal remote control . <EOS> maybe just as an option , w like we discussed , like ipod . <EOS> different colours , <EOS> uh maybe use even different fonts . <EOS>
now what is the whole day rating for that ? <EOS> the <EOS> excuse me ? <EOS> whole day's rating . <EOS> what type of battery ? <EOS> oh yeah <EOS> it's just a r uh simple battery a rechargeable uh <EOS> if you uh like it's exist . <EOS> yeah yeah . <EOS>
uh . <EOS> um like the switches , like we use buttons for user interface . <EOS> push-buttons . <EOS> put uh k i guess uh for yeah . <EOS> push-buttons . <EOS> and <EOS> not sure what they mean by supplements . <EOS> and <EOS> yeah . <EOS> well , i think that <EOS>
polymer <EOS> yeah . <EOS> it's fine . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> we got a bit ahead of ourselves , <EOS> i know we're not talking about making televisions at this point or anything like that , but <EOS> hmm . <EOS> fair enough . <EOS> edible televisions , it's a wave of the future . <EOS>
okay . okay . <EOS> that might be a little bit uh expensive . um <EOS> and something like an l_c_d_ screen . <EOS> for what purpose ? <EOS> um uh like i said here um maybe it's easy . <EOS> it's nice as an added feature feature , <EOS> that um , when you're on a certain channel , you can see on the l_c_d_ screen uh what programmes are coming up or <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> uh-huh . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , we'd have t that would mean we'd have to put two products together as well , <EOS> which which again would probably be a bit expensive , but <EOS> that is true , yes . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> there's key rings um that you kind of whistle at or clap at , <EOS> i can't remember , <EOS> and then they whistle back , or something like that . <EOS> that'd probably be really simple , <EOS> they're cheap . <EOS>
inside the remote . i know . <EOS> um i was gonna say a sharp noise , you know a clapping of hand or whatever . <EOS> you'd want to try and av just have the one product <EOS> that if <EOS> yeah . yeah if we if we could have it in the actual remote like everything in one one device . <EOS>
alright , <EOS> something went wrong . <EOS> tap . <EOS> okay , <EOS> but this this new remote we can afford . <EOS> it doesn't work . <EOS> let's forget . <EOS> it should've work . <EOS> okay , so <EOS> you had this list at start ? <EOS> alright . <EOS> when did you receive this list ? <EOS> ah okay . <EOS>
um as you can see the the remote control have parts and those parts look like that <EOS> and um <EOS> you know it's got a little operating procedure that looks something like that . <EOS> and i suppose you all know how it works because we've all used it <EOS> and we wouldn't be in a company designing remote controls if we didn't know what they were so <EOS> uh personal preferences , i think uh programmable options which um just require a small amount of memory , <EOS> uh non volatile memory , <EOS> just um so the user can put in their favourite channels and maybe their preferred volume settings so that when they turn it on it's not blasting . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> oh yeah . <EOS> mm or uh <EOS> 'cause there's certainly you know , the the corporate logo needs to be prominently uh displayed <EOS> so that people s th looked at it and say right , that's a real reaction remote control , i want one of those . <EOS>
hmm . <EOS> no , <EOS> i think th the the top buttons are okay . they sh those should be on top . <EOS> but uh we we can switch those two , <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> maybe <EOS> those two , yeah . <EOS> and uh , yeah , <EOS> you have to make sure it's easy to uh <EOS> yes , <EOS> it has to be big enough <EOS> so you can hold it , <EOS> right . <EOS>
so , then i had a look at new products that are on the market . <EOS> not necessarily remote controls but ones that you'll recognise . <EOS> um this is the voice , there is a voice recognition remote control , which can control mus multiple devices . <EOS> i have a <EOS> there is a picture . <EOS> you surf your favourite channels uh with your voice . <EOS> store up to eighty speech samples , controls four devices , t_v_ , cable , satellite , v_c_r_ , d_v_d_ and audio . <EOS> and you can record your own v verbal labels , that are connected to remote control functions . <EOS> so the technology is there . <EOS> um the one on the left is very similar to what we drew up on the board in the previous meeting , where there has scroll down functions on the side . <EOS> you can sort of just make those out . <EOS> and then on the right is obviously an ipod , <EOS> which is you know possibly one of the simplest things to use out there , <EOS> and really is , <EOS> and all that is is just a a nice big scroll menu that y you sort of go through . <EOS> that is a possibility . <EOS> and nothing's simpler really . <EOS> um then there's things like this , which is a a a kid's remote , <EOS> where the the parents have the facility to control and program what children can watch before . <EOS> so the remote control it o only allows them to access the channels that their parents want them to watch . <EOS> and um it means that th children have a novelty of having their own remote control . <EOS> so i don't know if there's a possibility of having one remote contr you know like we just had two components , <EOS> maybe it can have more components you know , different remotes . <EOS>
put the excel sheet in the <EOS> let's hope . <EOS> we're going to be here at eight o'clock . <EOS> n not in the <EOS> f fifty five euros . <EOS> folder . i think it's <EOS> i think it's still in my own documents folder . <EOS> we're goin still going to be here at eight o'clock . <EOS>
okay ? <EOS> right on time . <EOS> okay , <EOS> so you can <EOS> i guess we'll see you for lunch in a sec ? <EOS> cool . <EOS> okay , see you . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah , okay . <EOS> yeah . yeah . <EOS> well , <EOS> i think that he means that um maybe by some option uh make sure that um remote control and the t_v_ match , <EOS> and then after that you can um use some s insert some passwords <EOS> as being apparent that the children cannot use this uh change the settings of the t_v_ , like colour and then volume <EOS> and uh <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> i if it doesn't affect the price . um but i i think what they're pushing us towards here is in terms of thinking of ways to future-proof our system for future systems that have something else other than teletext maybe . <EOS> i dunno i'm <EOS> right it's just not <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
the sc <EOS> bad estimation . mm . <EOS> we've got a scroll wheel for the volume <EOS> don't we , <EOS> or is it some other thing that's not on there . <EOS> w ho h <EOS> is this a scroll wheel <EOS> or is this a a a sort of button which can be pressed on two sides uh so for higher and lower ? <EOS>
okay . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> oh yeah , yeah . <EOS> right , yeah , yeah , yeah . <EOS> okay , yeah , mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah , 'cause it's it's quite important that you don't lose the the bit to locate the remote control . <EOS> the l <EOS> well that's right , <EOS> but it solves the problem of having different noises . <EOS>
um <EOS> energy source i think we've , i think we've decided batteries , although not exciting , are probably our best bet . <EOS> right . <EOS> and we have five minutes . <EOS> okay when it comes to the chip-on-print , as i said , the the more advanced features you want , um the fancier the chip has to be and the more expensive . <EOS> uh if you want just a normal button version , the chip-on-print is gonna be <EOS>
give it a little bit . <EOS> oh <EOS> there we go . perfect . <EOS> okay . so <EOS> this is me . <EOS> um basically <EOS> i was looking through some marketing reports that we've got <EOS> and we had a usability test <EOS> where we were actually sort like watching a hundred people use t_v_ remotes <EOS> and see what it is that they're using <EOS> and then they filled out a questionnaire <EOS> about what they like and what they don't about their general t_v_ remote control practices . <EOS> um pretty much through testing we were finding out that most of the time , everybody's used to using changing the channel , turning it on , using the volume , <EOS> m <EOS> the majority of the time that's all that's going on , <EOS> the other functions happen , <EOS> for some people they're important , <EOS> but the primary uses are really really basic . <EOS> um and so big complicated remotes like one we saw in the last presentation are really not the general public's use , <EOS> they're not using a lot of it , <EOS> they don't need it , <EOS> they even find it frustrating when there are all those buttons that they don't know what to do with . <EOS> and um we also found out that uh fifty percent of our people , their the worst thing about a remote is how often they lose it . and then they can't find it in the room . <EOS> so i think what we were talking about with a pager or something , will really come into play with a lot of these people . <EOS> um there's also a survey about what they liked about remotes , <EOS> and pretty much they all think they're hideous and not very useful , <EOS> and the younger demographics are all really interested in voice recognition options . <EOS> i don't know if that's something we're ready to look into technically , <EOS> that's up to the design people , <EOS> but it is s something worth thinking about , <EOS> especially since the younger demographic's obviously the one that's gonna keep growing , <EOS> so if that's the direction we're headed in it's something to think about . <EOS> um but basically it really is the primary functions and getting it to look nice , which are <EOS>
or was it just <EOS> okay . <EOS> mm-mm-mm-mm . <EOS> cool . <EOS> mm-mm-mm-mm-mm . <EOS> f_ , what is it ? um . <EOS> function f_ eight . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> no signal . <EOS> oh no , . <EOS>
okay . so not to be focused on . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> um there was a mention just as kind of a warning about button design . <EOS> um just to avoid ambiguity . <EOS> so it gave the example of say your volume buttons for up and down , they might both have a v_ on for volume , <EOS> um let's think how they did this . <EOS>
yes . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> so <EOS> when the more expensive chip you mentioned there is is possible in the in the given budget , uh maybe we should go for for the more expensive chip , <EOS> so all features uh which you mentioned can be implemented based on the same chip . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> oh . <EOS> i've i s i think the easiest thing would be to to have a smaller l_c_d_ , if it's possible . <EOS> mm . <EOS> okay , so five to ten , i i think it's it's feasible . <EOS> i'll make it . <EOS>
exactly . and just be able to s use them all from the same remote , but not at the same time . <EOS> yes . <EOS> yeah <EOS> you can also browse through all the standards you know , where are the limit of standards for all of them and you can just browse through them . <EOS>
yeah yeah . <EOS> so it it's c uh it it <EOS> it is a uh uh easy uh a fancy thing that you you can bring to we can bring to the remote control that will not have any uh <EOS> yeah comp completely pointless for the inter for from the interaction point of v point of view . <EOS>
yeah , <EOS> i mean <EOS> i think so . um <EOS> i mean instru instruction books i feel c i reckon can cover that . <EOS> instruction manuals . <EOS> but i mean they're there's customer service , <EOS> there will be a customer service number thing that you can phone up and speak to <EOS> and that way there's no call out charge , <EOS> there's no extra , <EOS> t the person has to walk to a shop on the high street , um . <EOS>
so <EOS> first maybe just a small recap on how how do we watch trends <EOS> so <EOS> it's not so uh simple <EOS> you might think that it's easy <EOS> but uh it's not so simple . <EOS> anyway these days uh the best uh source of information is the web as you know , <EOS> so have to to go often on the web and look at uh what the others are doing , <EOS> and ask real people who are using real remote controls every day uh or any other tool that is similar to a remote control <EOS> which basically is a small device that people have with them , always , like a phone . <EOS> we can we can use the phone as a as a good uh uh example of where to in be inspired . <EOS> of course those tha d who are watching the trends are also have also to be inspired <EOS> because in fact they're not only watching the trends , <EOS> they're inventing it , they're creating the trend . <EOS> i hope i'm going to try to help you on that . <EOS> this is more risky <EOS> because you're not following the trend , <EOS> you try to invent it , <EOS> which means either you succeed and you make a lot of money or you don't and you're out of business . <EOS> so anyway uh <EOS> next slide please . <EOS>
yeah . yeah . <EOS> yeah , hmm . so , <EOS> is it okay for your presentation ? <EOS> nothing else to to add ? <EOS> yeah , it's done , <EOS> just yeah . if we would if we could remember like , not too many buttons and make it look fancy , i think it would make it . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> right okay . <EOS> so just to well to be thorough then , <EOS> width-wise we're looking at about what three centimetres or something ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay <EOS> and then so height-wise <EOS> hmm . <EOS> how how tall do you envisage it being ? <EOS> about that big ? <EOS> about two centimetres , okay . <EOS>
um then as mo as a lot of people indicated that their um remote got lost in the room , <EOS> it might be <EOS> and i say might be <EOS> because it would um certainly boost the uh production costs a lot . <EOS> but it might be a good idea to make a docking station . <EOS> and this would , could get a button in it <EOS> which would send a signal to the remote <EOS> which would then beep . <EOS> so you'd know where it is in the room . <EOS> and in addition to this it could um recharge the batteries in the remote if you put it in . <EOS>
mm go <EOS> what time is it anyw <EOS> oh yeah <EOS> sorry <EOS> you're right . <EOS> evaluation criteria is next in line . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> evaluation cri okay . <EOS> that's me . <EOS> hello . <EOS> oh there we go . <EOS> okay . <EOS> come on my computer . come on . <EOS> sorry <EOS> my computer's giving me technical difficulties . <EOS> should i press it again ? <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> if it was the very bottom price range or it was like between this and another one we did the same thing then i can imagine it being applying to the the demographic <EOS> yeah . <EOS> that's it's still ye <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm w w w we after this we can can consider uh for instance , making this more attractive to to the demographic <EOS>
say here . <EOS> interface to the microphone . <EOS> then the graphical card uh for the t_f_t_ <EOS> and the third unit is the i_r_ . <EOS> the good news is that we can uh we decided to use the infra-red unit <EOS> because our company has also developed the chip for communication by the infra-red , including all the stuff inside , <EOS> so it will be very cheap for us . <EOS> so infra-red here . <EOS> so the <EOS> once again the overall requirements , <EOS> seven to seven centimetres for the board , <EOS> which has to be <EOS> which can be spongy but has to be this size , <EOS> and the t_f_t_ which is seven inches . <EOS> um i have to check what i wanted to <EOS> uh from my point of view i don't care about the about the material used for the overall des uh ov all the device . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> fi b <EOS> like <EOS> what are they called , those face plate things ? <EOS> isn't there a name for them ? <EOS> are they ? <EOS> i dunno . <EOS> think they're just called face plates ? <EOS> i don't know . <EOS> something , <EOS> uh we'll have to come up with a name , <EOS> patent it . <EOS>
yeah , <EOS> scroll wheels um <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , that's good . <EOS> we can use multiple scroll wheels , w if we want to . <EOS> but i think just the volume is enough . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> uh for channels it's not handy , <EOS> because you scroll too fast . <EOS>
um so basically it's the it's the flip open thing again . <EOS> so now we we have the okay , <EOS> so ma maarika will explain you the user interface there . <EOS> and it flips open on the side , so it opens like that . <EOS> and we have the user interface o in here <EOS> and uh the the l_c_d_ and and the scroll are inside . <EOS> um <EOS>
uh . <EOS> okay . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> uh uh to me in a marketing sense it's not it's not relative . <EOS> we can we can o we can uh accentuate whatever <EOS> whatever product you put in there we can find a way to accentuate it . <EOS>
okay , so <EOS> the f the f the points we had last meeting was the um should be a univ uh universal remote control <EOS> no , <EOS> that's i uh s <EOS> i just got a email from the from the personal coach <EOS> and it should be a t_v_ remote control only . <EOS> so <EOS> have you changed that part ? <EOS> um so yeah , <EOS> it still has to be uh f a r a remote control for kids and elderly . <EOS> it's it's still the same . um <EOS>
under documents in the shared folder . <EOS> okay . <EOS> yes . <EOS> do do we have to say something about that ? <EOS> i i i'm not fully updated about this shared folder uh . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> i guess we'll have a shared folder uh with documents that we can share . <EOS> and uh , yeah . <EOS>
yeah , s yeah , um . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yours is well <EOS> i think you can put anywhere you want , actually . <EOS> yeah <EOS> but the the mic should not <EOS> i thin <EOS> it's not a directional mic , anyway . <EOS> i think it should work like this . <EOS> so i will try to get my presentation running . <EOS>
s upscale technology . <EOS> well . <EOS> yeah , yes . <EOS> ah , we we're do you know , selling a unique product uh . <EOS> that actually makes more sense if we're gonna make it so highly customisable , <EOS> 'cause on the web people can look at the different options they have , see maybe what other people have done , what the range of possibility as , <EOS> whereas if you're in a store , you can't unless you're a highly imaginative person , you may not really know what it is you want , <EOS> whereas on the web , if you have a bunch of pictures , it can sort of trigger ideas and <EOS>
yep . <EOS> close t <EOS> uh do you know where clare de lune coffee shop is , <EOS> and <EOS> yes . <EOS> on university , <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah <EOS> it's actually like literally half a mile from my house . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> pretty cool . <EOS> small world <EOS> as we were discussing before . <EOS>
yeah , <EOS> like a s kind of service centre . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> ser o <EOS> and they can download it for you . <EOS> yeah , maybe something like service cen <EOS> or you could well you could s actually look at the place-holder you talked about earlier , <EOS> and you could probably uh make a connection to uh an telephone line or a internet connection . <EOS>
yeah , it can be a crocodile , it can be a crocodile . <EOS> well it was it was an at first <EOS> firstly it was an attempt at a t_ rex <EOS> and then it sort of changed into a pelican <EOS> but it can be a crocodile now actually . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so <EOS> that's uh basically it . <EOS> maybe this one ? <EOS> then we can save this one in the folders group . <EOS> uh yes , it's here . <EOS> smartboard , there it it . <EOS> so <EOS> if you wanna have a look at it , it's over there in the projects folder . <EOS>
so , after that ? <EOS> f_ eight . <EOS> f oh sorry f_ eight . <EOS> that's the wee blue one . <EOS> blue one f_ eight . <EOS> should do it , good one . <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> uh , me again , rajan the marketing expert . <EOS> uh , as we have decided in the last meeting that i have to find out , <EOS> sorry , yeah sure . <EOS>
mm , well <EOS> my my personal view is uh w when when this one is eight euros we must think how can we improve it . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> and then i mean w w w you must just see it <EOS> we can still spend this four and a half euro <EOS> and
right . <EOS> it's a starting point anyway , <EOS> so . <EOS> no <EOS> we could have a s very simple touch screen , you know , <EOS> there's always the opportunity , <EOS> if it's gonna be about the size of the ipod or whatever , you know , w we yeah , i guess we can play around with it a bit . <EOS> alright , <EOS> let's let's say that okay so the touch screen will be our um our main selling point here . <EOS>
maybe a it'd be s axially symmetric . <EOS> huh . <EOS> like what's what's that , <EOS> i don't even know the name of it , <EOS> some kind of , you know where it's like looks like a little snowman kind of thing . <EOS> i don't know the name of that . <EOS>
yeah <EOS> and probably it would look better as well . <EOS> no , <EOS> it cou certainly opens up the possibility for making it uh , you know , visually very distinctive . <EOS> yeah . yeah . <EOS> um 'cause you know , it does not have to be a oblong box . <EOS>
um one thing i thought of with the remote control is you always lose 'em . <EOS> okay . <EOS> mm . <EOS> so if there's a g a way of finding it quite easily , i thought that'd be quite good quite a good feature . <EOS> ch <EOS> so we should we should set our remote control up to where it has a uh <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> now we can look at this . <EOS> this is <EOS> we're probably not supposed to look at this , but <EOS> the old versions . <EOS> yeah , from the previous group . <EOS> they went for uh for a universal device . <EOS> yeah , but also a different device . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so s yeah . <EOS> yeah <EOS> , they can yeah they can be hide somewhere by a cover or something like this . <EOS> like covering cu . <EOS> yeah , like mobile phone covering . <EOS> not used very often . <EOS>
uh yeah , <EOS> that's that's what we needed basically . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm . mm . okay . <EOS> uh that's needed right now . <EOS> and uh basically you can look to the standards of other <EOS> yeah that's needed , yeah . <EOS> and if we want to get the market , we really need that . <EOS>
okay , <EOS> uh just wondering if i need to include it in the minutes , <EOS> because if you're submitting it anyway then <EOS> okay great . <EOS> i will , yeah . <EOS> it keeps getting too big . <EOS> cool <EOS> . um right , uh well next up then , because we've done finance , is the project evaluation . <EOS>
think we can first <EOS> right it was function f_ eight or something . <EOS> mm . <EOS> this one right there . <EOS> tha <EOS> okay . <EOS> who is gonna do a powerpoint presentation ? <EOS> okay . <EOS> think we all <EOS> huh . <EOS> you will as well ? <EOS>
no , <EOS> f go to findings . <EOS> no , no . <EOS> no no , no no . <EOS> 'cause i had another comment there . <EOS> uh the market trend . this is what we know from the last uh from the questionnaires from the the all the p surveys we've done , <EOS> fancy and feel-good , that's what we've been looking for , <EOS> something that feels good in the hand , that's easy to use . <EOS> looking for next generation of innovation , <EOS> because all the remotes out there now , they're all very similar , they all do the same thing , <EOS> we have to have something completely different . <EOS> okay ? <EOS> easy to use , has always has become has become another major interest that uh , <EOS> with the whiteboard we can see that it's a remote that's easy to use . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> or it's something like isn't hardware the first one ? <EOS> and the second one is for the software . <EOS> yeah to run th to make it run . <EOS> that's it . <EOS> is the is the software par <EOS> alri okay . <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
yeah . you can't lose it . <EOS> it does have an a built in function . <EOS> or if you're you're sixty years old , your demands <EOS> yeah , <EOS> but a har a hard to lose is good . <EOS> so it should this question should be hard to lose . it's difficult to lose it . <EOS>
well i think both are really easy to use <EOS> because there are few button buttons , <EOS> and uh well t p the menu are clear , well-organised , so <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> well with little knowing of the technology you can you can easily use the product <EOS> so i will give a six for the easy to use . <EOS>
innocent . <EOS> and uh just sum up a few of its favourite characteristics . <EOS> um the only thing we have to uh look after is that we use different colours , and different line width . <EOS> uh there's <EOS> i can start from now . i will . <EOS> you can use this pen by holding it like a like a little child . <EOS> because if you hold it like this , the sensors will get blocked <EOS> and then the drawing won't get good . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> which i think is quite tricky . <EOS> um , basically we're trying to get people to buy a remote control <EOS> wouldn't they already have a remote control with their television when they buy one ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> of course they have already one . <EOS> so our our our remote control has to be better . <EOS>
alright . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> so <EOS> these are the two different ones . <EOS> this one um this is the user centred , <EOS> it has uh quite a few mm uh um fewer buttons <EOS> and then this is the engineering centred , <EOS> which has a lot more buttons , <EOS> and probably this is one that people complain about , about having too many buttons <EOS> that you don't use . <EOS> so basically , <EOS> what a remote control is is you it's to send messages to the television set , <EOS> you know , <EOS> turn on , off , switch the channels and the volume and things such as that . <EOS> and so for this product it's gonna be television only , <EOS> and then it has to have the uh logos <EOS>
how it looks , or like what it does ? <EOS> wha what um <EOS> well probably our target group and how it's gonna going to appeal to our target group <EOS> and i dunno the the s <EOS> the buttons and what it does and that sort of thing . so . <EOS>
but they'll notice it after like a year , <EOS> they'll be like hey , i have never changed the battery . <EOS> and if it's made of like latex , that whole idea , that's pretty cool . <EOS> i'll give it a three . <EOS> mm . just the material . <EOS>
hmm . <EOS> spongy . <EOS> spongy . <EOS> spongy , like sponge . <EOS> okay . <EOS> so rubber , kind of . <EOS> uh soft materials . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> it's very uh difficult to to to do it . <EOS> because it's only twelve and a half euros you have to spend on every remote control . <EOS>
like random which we have no other place to put , but we need it somewhere there . <EOS> um even even if it doesn't map very clearly what happens is that people at least have some in their mind . <EOS> it's easy to use , i think <EOS> that's one thing that um <EOS> and i guess from the component point of view it's easy to build as well <EOS> 'cause things are like fixed . <EOS>
well so it's a microphone array . <EOS> no <EOS> it's just a single microphone , <EOS> and you <EOS> i i think uh we we put it here because i think when you when you are browsing your l_c_d_ you will be close to <EOS> well it's better to to to place it here th than here , for instance . <EOS> and here is a little switch that control if you want the the speaker uh recognition system to um to be on or off . <EOS>
very quickly . <EOS> no . <EOS> yeah , well people go to buy another remote control when they broke n broke their , <EOS> and they want to go t for universal one , and they take the fanciest they can have . <EOS> so this is that we z that that we should target . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> uh . <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> right , well , i guess that's us . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> it's not telling <EOS> it's not saying do anything in particular just yet . <EOS> so maybe you should go back to your own offices . <EOS>
thank you very much brian . <EOS> if you want me to help , yeah . <EOS> um , yep . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay , and then what do i press , f_ eight ? <EOS> uh f_ eight . function f_ eight . <EOS> function f_ eight . <EOS>
which ones were yours ? <EOS> uh <EOS> th th th th <EOS> i don't know , <EOS> technical functions . <EOS> they're a bit small , you can we should stretch them , <EOS> because <EOS> techni <EOS> ping . <EOS> ja ja ja ja ja . technical functions . yeah okay . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> they're not used often <EOS> but they are quite important when they're used . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> uh would appear to be essential . <EOS> stand out . <EOS> um . so <EOS> we if we can design something that that looks interesting , <EOS> know , <EOS> or looks different , <EOS> um incorporates the the logo and and the colours <EOS> and um we can still have our interchangeable fascias even if it's the yellow and grey , um <EOS> and uh i dunno , <EOS> buttons or or buttons as an option . <EOS>
and then well if you do that it goes , <EOS> but if you like that makes more sense <EOS> 'cause there's already ones with up and down here , that i've seen . <EOS> so it's like holding <EOS> you can o <EOS> and you <EOS> you <EOS> is there an extra actual button ? <EOS> or are you actually you're just using the mouse to go up and down . <EOS> like <EOS>
it does but it i just don't really <EOS> it said um <EOS> yeah . <EOS> it said <EOS> what effect should the thing ha should it have , <EOS> okay . alright . <EOS> and working design . <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah <EOS> like <EOS> be a medium between you and the telly i think , <EOS> that's uh <EOS>
very specific . <EOS> yeah , so that's the reason you are here for uh the design , okay , <EOS> i hope you made a good design . <EOS> yes , but i'm not everybody . <EOS> i mean the whole point of user evaluation is to see what real people need . <EOS> we have our own motivations in mind , we have our own ideas in mind , <EOS> but that doesn't mean that that's what's gonna sell . <EOS>
and um although mo most people will buy s televisions and everything for uh that have loads of loads of little functions and everything <EOS> and they mostly end up using simple functions and little things <EOS> and most the people won't won't get too mad of actually having to go the to the s to the television to , for instance , tune in their the stations . <EOS> there's no need to have that in the remote . <EOS> so um <EOS> um as for what i would recommend for uh the the interface design , and uh i will change the colours on the on the logo , but um we should go for the user-oriented device , <EOS> so simple controls and good ergonomics . <EOS> um and uh although i th i th i'm still here recommending the teletext so i'll remove that , i guess , <EOS> but um we should go for the <EOS>
this one ? <EOS> great . <EOS> no , not that one . <EOS> you are two . <EOS> two . <EOS> alright . <EOS> okay so the working design is uh <EOS> user i interface could be of two types , <EOS> one is the usual press buttons which are there so that the user feels that he is knoing doing some he is knowing about that technology . <EOS> so he is pretty comfortable if he wants to get this , <EOS> and on top of that there there could be a speech recognition technology also being sitting on the on the remote . <EOS> so the old kind of users who don't want to have any changes , it can it can be useful for them , <EOS> and the new users , as uh our marketing expert was saying , they can use the new gizmo which is speech recognition kind of thing . <EOS>
i think it's the next it's the blue one , yeah . <EOS> oh , uh , there we go . <EOS> uh . <EOS> okay . um . <EOS> well so that fruit and vegetables thing huh . <EOS> i actually wasn't aware of the new trends in electronics <EOS> and and uh <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> no . <EOS> i'll add it later , i guess the presentation . <EOS> okay , right . <EOS> um okay , <EOS> if we can move on to next presentation then please . um <EOS> mm-hmm . yeah . <EOS> sure . <EOS> do you want to switch places ? <EOS>
i just forgot their name , <EOS> so uh <EOS> you're <EOS> i <EOS> sorry , <EOS> i just forgot them all . <EOS> so <EOS> i have to write it down . <EOS> okay . <EOS> so <EOS> fine . <EOS> do you know them <EOS> or <EOS> the names ? <EOS>
so final design . final design . <EOS> okay so <EOS> michael you can go ahead . <EOS> yeah so uh following our decision to uh make a yellow well to make a banana <EOS> yeah can you show it to the the camera maybe . <EOS> remote <EOS> okay so <EOS> we actually have a <EOS>
um m for which one are we going ? <EOS> my mistake . <EOS> let's vote . <EOS> that one or uh <EOS> yeah , <EOS> my vote goes out to the right . <EOS> your vote and your <EOS> okay . <EOS> my vote too . <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
yeah . it's a great idea . it's a great idea . <EOS> do yous not find that , um , like , there's a lot of , um , buttons on your remote control , and you don't know what half of them do . <EOS> yeah , i don't know what they do . <EOS>
you were saying that the kinetic would be useful , <EOS> that is you just have to move it some and you'd be able to use it <EOS> um as opposed to a battery that you have to either put it in a recharger or um keep replacing the batteries . um <EOS> or solar that you'd have difficulty with it if it's a dark day , that it'll die on you , and no way to do it . <EOS> that's the day you wanna use the t_v_ . <EOS> um so what's our pleasure here , what would be the cost consequences of each of the three ? <EOS>
okay let's let's evaluate if it's fancy or <EOS> yeah , it's fancy , according to me . <EOS> seven but <EOS> yeah , six . <EOS> seven . seven by me . <EOS> s seven . <EOS> six . <EOS> i would say seven . <EOS> it's quite fancy . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> 'kay . <EOS> and it should be easy to use . especially the volume buttons , the channel buttes buttons and the number buttons to zap through the channels . <EOS> um , well <EOS> thank you all , huh . <EOS> i dunno uh did everyone receive an email with uh the new project requirements ? <EOS> no ? <EOS> well , <EOS>
oh yeah . <EOS> yeah , so it's really molded to to your specific <EOS> to t an <EOS> and then you would know like um what the geometry of their hands would be and uh <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> how hard they squeeze ? <EOS> resistance resistance , right . <EOS>
receiving . oh yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> difficult . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i i think it's uh most cheap or cheapest to just do the updates uh at the service centre or at the shop . <EOS> yeah , that would be probably best , yeah . <EOS>
yes . twelve i believe . <EOS> so this comes to eighteen . <EOS> mm . <EOS> and that's without any special button supplements . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> one scroll wheel you might need . <EOS> so <EOS> so <EOS> we'd have a special colour , special form and special material on all of them . <EOS> they're not just standard buttons . <EOS>
but i mean we've got a a prototype . <EOS> such as it is . <EOS> so <EOS> i dunno , <EOS> i i think it's gone okay today , considering the information that we've had at our disposal , and um such . <EOS> maybe the counts wou woulda been better if we had a list or more yeah , to begin with . <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> so this is a standard off the shelf kind of a chip , is it ? <EOS> right , <EOS> it's very <EOS> they're very cheap remote . <EOS> this remote costs nothing , you know . <EOS> um so that takes a signals from the buttons and translates it into a sequence of pulses that it then sends to the to the amplifier , <EOS> which is made of some transistors and amplifiers , op-amps , <EOS> and then that gets sent to the uh to the l_e_d_ light , <EOS> which i can kinda see is that little red light bulb at the end , <EOS> and that sends out the infrared uh light signal to the television . <EOS> oh here it is . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> so the question is still open about the l_c_d_ thing . <EOS> um uh we <EOS> i hope that next meeting we will uh we'll take some um decision that direction . <EOS> thanks . <EOS> bye . <EOS> yep . <EOS>
towards yourself , so you can easily see your screen . <EOS> well well you have it in your hand so it's a kind of an angle from your eyes to the screen . <EOS> so then you have double double curved in some way . <EOS> so this this is so the screen is positioned over here . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> interface ? <EOS> oh , industrial . <EOS> industrial designer . <EOS> that's me . <EOS> industrial designer . <EOS> i have to remember these things . um . <EOS> you'll be beginning your , your working design . <EOS> um , u_i_d_ the technical functions design will , will be worked on the next thirty minutes . <EOS> um , maybe how this can be achieved , <EOS> and , um , we need the user requirements from the manag <EOS> marketing expert . <EOS> um , you will get specific instructions , um , of what to do in the next half an hour . <EOS> and i'll see you in half an hour , <EOS> okay ? <EOS> 'kay . <EOS>
yeah , yeah , yeah . <EOS> yeah if you do , it w so it would have to be you <EOS> i mean so you basically just kinda need to figure out like what kind of , you know , range we need to have on the wheel , <EOS> and um <EOS> so you're either you're you know , th you're either doing this motion to like control the channels or like once once you stop that , you know , you can like tap for , um , different <EOS>
give me more . <EOS> another question . <EOS> remotes overwhelmed with buttons . <EOS> no . <EOS> no . <EOS> no . <EOS> no , <EOS> that that's that's <EOS> yeah . <EOS> tha that's a one , i think , that's definitely a one . <EOS> but um i mean , <EOS> that's definitely one . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> mm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> okay , jolly good . <EOS> for the case of the remotes itself , um they can be a general case , which is just a flat one . <EOS> you can have uh a curved one or a double curved one , <EOS> if you know what i mean , so <EOS>
okay . <EOS> mm . okay . um <EOS> mm 'kay . <EOS> uh maybe uh mael c c can you give uh uh your presentation uh ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm i okay <EOS> i stay <EOS> oh , <EOS> this is <EOS> now you can move i think <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
yeah , but then <EOS> but then you can learn to use your right h <EOS> like i was just thinking if there's left-handers and right-handers in the family , what , they have two remotes ? <EOS> yes s <EOS> yeah , i know i know people who have left-handed and right-handed people in the family and they all use the computer for the whole the same computer the fes family and they have a mouse , and everybody is using right-handed mouse . <EOS>
mm-mm . okay , so <EOS> you explore now that you're going to work together these these two . <EOS> or or spongy an <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> maybe we can have two different assembly also like one spongy and one kind of titanium . <EOS> we have only the plastic or the the chippy yeah fibre chips or <EOS>
too bad . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> the microphone . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> and that's it . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> a and we changed something , i guess , <EOS> or not ? <EOS> we <EOS> and the microphone . <EOS> oh no . <EOS> yep . <EOS> okay . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> i feel like voice recognition would be , i don't know , w it would be too hard to really <EOS> i mean we could do it , but <EOS> hmm . <EOS> programme . <EOS> if it's within our price to get that kind of chip that would , you know , technology <EOS>
there's nothing like that ? <EOS> but th is there any there's no actual innovation in that at all , <EOS> it's just a straight-out remote control . <EOS> yeah , yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . mm-hmm . <EOS> the only innova innovation is the shape . <EOS>
um . so what is the goal of this project ? is to design a new remote control . <EOS> so it should be , of course , new and original , <EOS> and um it should be trendy , and user friendly . <EOS> that mean it's a very challenging project , <EOS> and uh <EOS> uh . so w it's <EOS> we will try to do our best , <EOS> and hopefully come with something very new and that people want to buy . <EOS> so , um <EOS> so what's uh what are we going to do during this all this project ? <EOS> so it's more like we are going to do inv individual work all in o in o our specialities <EOS> and we are going to meet each other quite often to discuss and to find a good way . <EOS> um . <EOS> yeah and everything is will be like this . <EOS>
uh . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah yeah , what the which channels the viewer <EOS> mm-mm . <EOS> okay . <EOS> so i think we have full of idea . <EOS> okay . <EOS> um we're going to meet again in thirty minutes <EOS> and uh i want you to mm work on these ideas <EOS> and try to make a uh the ones , make um to decide what what are the ones important and what are the one that we don't want . <EOS> and um m maybe more in the technical parts what uh do we want to do . <EOS> um . <EOS> so um your personal coach will send you some instruction for for this thirty minutes . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah yeah , it's just and it's one thing which has everything . <EOS> yeah , and it is yeah . <EOS> it is really <EOS> but do you need a screen then , do you have to have a screen then ? <EOS> well can't it tell the like can't you if you <EOS> you can have the number on the telly going like one two three four five once you scroll and then <EOS>
it was one remote , i think , <EOS> different colours . <EOS> easy to use . <EOS> so for the older people , a more traditional uh form . <EOS> that is my <EOS> yeah , <EOS> like the older o older colours i can maybe <EOS> you could you could uh change the colours , that was also the idea . <EOS> i don't know which shape you should should take , <EOS> but . <EOS>
yeah , <EOS> i also wrote down some stuff <EOS> that you want on a <EOS> yeah , <EOS> no maybe not not uh , <EOS> that's not a f that's something for for for yeah . <EOS> that's not for you . <EOS> technical fun fu <EOS> okay . <EOS>
yeah , yeah . <EOS> maybe in in legos you know ? be fun with legos too , <EOS> like make a remote control or spaceship , <EOS> we used to have spaceship legos <EOS> did you guys ever used to build spaceships with legos <EOS> everybody knows best spaceships ever . <EOS> um you guys felt like there was enough teamwork in all ? <EOS>
can be easily done , <EOS> 'cause <EOS> yeah . <EOS> you got simple designs , <EOS> y <EOS> we should put it to simple actions . <EOS> let it be universal , <EOS> so you want to use it for your hi-fi system . <EOS> you want to change tracks <EOS> and you want to adjust volume . <EOS>
.. . <EOS> okay . <EOS> so , this is uh first meeting of this design project . <EOS> um and i um like to show you the agenda for the meeting , <EOS> i don't know if it was sent round to all of you . <EOS> mm , yeah . <EOS> i didn't receive it yet . <EOS>
yeah . yeah . <EOS> volume , maybe a mute button , and then on off button . <EOS> mm . <EOS> and that's all ? <EOS> uh i know that som <EOS> you say that many people are doing plenty of a lot of zapping . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS>
i think that that's a good idea , <EOS> because you know that's one of the most important buttons . <EOS> just <EOS> okay . <EOS> well , should it be larger buttons in general , <EOS> you know like uh the examples that i had , they were swi quite small . <EOS> so should we try and go for something that has l larger buttons ? <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> now there should be some timer to set for viewing a particular a particular programme or switching on and off a uh a particular programme according to the user choice . <EOS> on the on on the remote . <EOS> yeah , mm-hmm . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> sure . <EOS> t <EOS> mm . <EOS> sure . <EOS> mm . and making it a bright colour helps <EOS> with the <EOS> personally i would have gone for purple . <EOS> mm . bright colour . <EOS> so <EOS> we still have that noise thing , <EOS> yeah ? <EOS> os <EOS> on a scale of one to seven , how would you guys rate it for finding finding it once it's lost ? <EOS>
well i actually did um think about it myself <EOS> but i thought you know because you could potentially you know you could be pushing it down as you scroll it for a instead of a turbo button <EOS> but you know the turbo button does add that extra class . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> mm . <EOS> uh no innovative yeah . <EOS> uh uh uh there w there was a there was a issue here is that what are what is the display on the l_c_d_ ? <EOS> talk about <EOS> we haven't really uh determined what are actually actually <EOS> it's good to have a l_c_d_ <EOS> but what are we gonna display on a l_c_d_ ? <EOS>
okay . <EOS> the joystick would be in the right place . <EOS> and also this is a rather nicer de uh design gimmick that the the um you know the whole thing you know it should have sort of organic feel to it <EOS> that it should be , you know , soft to touch <EOS> and <EOS>
yeah , mm . <EOS> yeah . yeah . <EOS> somewhere like that <EOS> so it just sort of <EOS> we might have to lengthen it <EOS> so it kinda your hand still holds it <EOS> and have it there , <EOS> yeah , yeah , yeah like that , like that . yeah . <EOS>
mm . lovely . um . <EOS> yeah , . <EOS> okay , <EOS> yeah . great . um . <EOS> right . <EOS> yeah <EOS> i've got a <EOS> if you load up my evaluation document . <EOS> yeah , okay . <EOS> excellent work . <EOS> okay . <EOS>
oh , <EOS> it's um , seems very understandable . <EOS> clearly your research and uh and ours uh heading in the same direction , <EOS> and um uh <EOS> yep . <EOS> the only thing that i saw missing from uh your your research that we found was this uh ability to find the doggone thing when you need it . <EOS>
scroll up or scroll down the channels . <EOS> uh it looks mm looks like something i can sell . <EOS> okay and now i'm supposed to <EOS> yeah . <EOS> well , i have one question <EOS> uh will there be anything written on the buttons , like that people know , or they have to learn that from a piece of paper which button does what ? <EOS>
mm dots , never mind . <EOS> i guess we'll give it maximum points in everything . <EOS> yeah , the yeah , <EOS> it's definitely attractive . <EOS> yeah , i agree . <EOS> oh , the locatable thing we actually forgot . <EOS> well , i thought we'd um kinda said that you'd have a little thing to stick on the t_v_ ? <EOS>
um the project process , satisfaction with , for example , the room for creativity . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> leadership , <EOS> sure . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> teamwork , <EOS> yes . <EOS> means , of having whiteboard , the digital pens and all that kind of good things . <EOS>
against the no teletext ? <EOS> mm . <EOS> yes . <EOS> um <EOS> besides that , i think the market for forty plus is like pretty small . <EOS> but i mean if i s if i see this , it's i think we're just gonna go for another <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> like televi some o older telephones use a l uh maybe it's possible to to flip them open and uh just expand the number of options that are normally visible . um <EOS> yeah okay , <EOS> but but if you pick the the idea , the left idea <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> it seems like you're gonna have rubber cases , as well as buttons . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> um . <EOS> and that you can make them curved or double-curved <EOS> and that would be the kind of sleek and sexy look . <EOS> oh yeah yeah <EOS> one of the things were if you had rubber buttons then you had to have a rubber case . <EOS>
there you go . sweet . <EOS> well so . <EOS> here we have a uh my technical functions design presentation . <EOS> um so a few of the requirements we need here . <EOS> uh we n basically need to operate an electronic device , <EOS> it needs to be universal <EOS> um and possibly uh operate several different types of devices <EOS> although we now uh find that uh that that's no problem . <EOS> um so <EOS> some of my findings . <EOS> um basically wanna send messages uh to a television set . <EOS> um that would be any number of different things uh such as switch on the television , uh switch to the next channel , that sort of thing , <EOS> i think we're all quite uh <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> and point at ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> we're just <EOS> we're actually just each of us discussing something that's in each of our own minds . <EOS> it wasn't until we had this here , you know , <EOS> like at one point i peeked across and looked at craig's paper and i'm like , now i know what he's thinking 'cause i saw his book . <EOS>
zapping your favourite channels , eh ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> scrolling through your favourites list . <EOS> oh okay okay . <EOS> zapping you know zapping . <EOS> ah 'kay okay , that's favourites . <EOS> maybe it's just a portuguese thing . <EOS> and um yeah that was the result . <EOS>
hmm . <EOS> and the the having the the the screen on the television screen i think is a good idea , <EOS> 'cause um otherwise we're we're putting up the price not only for putting building the l_c_d_ in , but for the electronics as well . <EOS> and it's a little bit pointless as well i think . <EOS> like <EOS> when when when you've got when you've got the screen there , it doesn't have to be anything fancy , <EOS> just a little menu showing <EOS> yeah , <EOS> a menu , you go into one menu <EOS> and then it can have your different options , whether you wanna change the settings or the you know , your information about programme that's on at the moment . <EOS>
that was good . <EOS> this is fine for making a presentat for project presentations . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah anyway we have the laboratory nearby to build our modules so it's okay . <EOS> good job good job . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> and the leadership was excellent . <EOS>
yeah . yeah . <EOS> and then you can use yellow or semething . <EOS> why not ? <EOS> aye . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm . yeah . <EOS> as long as you loo use uh high contrast between the the background and the foreground colour . <EOS> so that people with uh with <EOS>
okay . <EOS> the second thing that was mentioned as important was the technological innovations . <EOS> that would be like if we use something like the space material or the l_c_d_ screen , things like that . <EOS> and then ease of use was the third most important , <EOS> whi <EOS> so <EOS> really , no matter what , we need to focus the most on fancy look and feel , according to this . <EOS> i don't know how much we agree with that . <EOS> and then the fashion watch talks about that this year's top trend for clothes , <EOS> shoes and furniture is fruits and vegetables and tha that there's a preference for spongy , tight material . <EOS> and so that brings us to my personal preferences . <EOS> who wants a spongy remote or one with fruit and vegetable padding . <EOS> personally , i don't really think that i want one that's gonna go out of style or go stale , excuse the pun , um in a year , so <EOS>
yeah , it's too big , it's too fat . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> fat document , those . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay , um <EOS> and what about the teamwork ? <EOS> team work was okay . <EOS> i think it was great , <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
mm . okay . <EOS> wh what what <EOS> i'd probably go with three again for that one . <EOS> yeah <EOS> i think it's uh it has more market actually . <EOS> or even even one and two . mm-hmm . <EOS> y yeah , you know <EOS> two . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> that was a bit mean to put it in the end . <EOS> and uh what were the other points to to improve this whole process ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> uh , i dunno . <EOS> um yeah . <EOS> nothing . <EOS> think that's about it . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> heavier <EOS> um less heavy laptops . <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
yeah , well <EOS> will we move on to user interface , <EOS> and <EOS> yeah ? <EOS> um sorry , <EOS> as long as were you ? <EOS> yeah . okay . <EOS> um and d d d interface concept . <EOS> . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yep i'm finished . <EOS>
if you set the pen yeah , he will draw here . <EOS> doesn't work . <EOS> okay , so <EOS> just finish it . <EOS> so we make it a bit like m that one probably . <EOS> yeah , i'll see it . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> is that okay ? <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> it's it's not very important , <EOS> so yeah . <EOS> but it's cool if it was green . <EOS> green or red or whatever , it is cool . <EOS> yeah , i know . <EOS> just to indicate it's working . <EOS> so mm <EOS> and uh the receptor in the t_v_ senses the pattern . <EOS> so we have to understand what patterns are used to , you know , to make it universal . <EOS> so that it can be used with all the t_v_s . <EOS> we have to really understand what patterns are used , <EOS> so we can uh o on the <EOS> otherwise it won't work . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah. . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> but otherwise like we can put some display on numbers <EOS> and then they can just press suppose two five they just press two and five <EOS> and then <EOS> so it would be <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
but it's electronic so it's made in japan . <EOS> yeah it's just a logo . <EOS> so is that j is that just is that just a logo or does it do anything ? <EOS> just a logo <EOS> and then like ninja homer , <EOS> right okay . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> the <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> that's a good idea . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> well also we have to decide uh <EOS> so it should be lightening in the dark i think because most people lost their remote control . <EOS>
you're not satisfied , <EOS> okay . <EOS> let's start over again then . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> let's make a different remote . well <EOS> menu . <EOS> a two ? <EOS> we only have twos . <EOS> a two . <EOS> oh , well <EOS> that's that's pretty good , <EOS> huh ? <EOS>
okay , six point five . <EOS> handy ? <EOS> again i'll give seven . <EOS> seven . <EOS> i'd give it a six <EOS> like i'd i think it's probably more handy than my current remote , 'cause of the scroll wheels <EOS> but maybe loses the point for not having you know the extra buttons when you reall if you do need them for some reason <EOS> but you know you can always use your other <EOS>
yeah , <EOS> but it's <EOS> oh th i thought would , that that would be the same . <EOS> if you push something , it it all lights up . <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah . yeah yeah , <EOS> it it mustn't work all the time . <EOS> it uh uh it have to work only when you use it . <EOS> so if you <EOS> no , <EOS> if you use one button , it must turn uh on for twenty seconds , and then it must turn off . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> so there there was uh there were many other materials like wood , titanium and all those things , <EOS> but plastic is i think is the most appropriate one , <EOS> it'll bring the cost down <EOS> and anyway it's <EOS> yeah . <EOS> although , you know , wood could be uh quite a stylish uh option , <EOS> if you take like , nice quality kind of wood that's got a nice grain and you kind of put some , some varnish on . <EOS>
right well . <EOS> welcome to the what should be the last of these meetings <EOS> and uh it looks like we've uh done a good job here <EOS> and uh we'll just go through the the final uh the final details . <EOS> um okay , <EOS> oh <EOS> the um th the the minutes of the last meeting uh i think we'll take those as read , um <EOS>
yeah , it's true yeah . <EOS> but uh , do we want that ? <EOS> on the market point of view , yeah . what do you think uh , l_c_d_ is a major feature , or ? <EOS> mm . i <EOS> for the price , <EOS> it's gonna be what we can afford , <EOS> and it's looking like we can't afford the l_c_d_ display , there's no way we can get it in there . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> gotta do what you gotta do . <EOS> alright , so <EOS> we're in agreement on that . <EOS> unfortunately i think we are . <EOS> no , <EOS> i think that was a good compromise you brought forward sarah . <EOS> right . <EOS> moving along swiftly . <EOS> um , so <EOS> i guess now we just go to the project evaluation <EOS> which i will allow sarah to take over . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> well <EOS> and if and if we introduced it when they're this age , they're going to probably always buy a remote that has <EOS> just sitcoms and stuff . <EOS> right . <EOS> so <EOS> well , then then do you put the voice recognition do you put the r like receiver on the actual television , in the base , or in the actual remote , <EOS> 'cause then you've already got remote in your hand , why you just gonna speak to the remote , <EOS> whereas if you just speak in general and you don't have to have the remote in your hand and like talk at it . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yep . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> well i suppose that if you're if you're away and you're not using it , then you're not using any power either . <EOS> so you'd have the battery as the kind of to keep it ticking over idea <EOS> i'm really sorry <EOS> we're gonna have to wrap up quite quickly , <EOS> we don't have as much time as i thought . <EOS> um so i think that's what energy is referring to here . <EOS> chip on print , is that that's an industrial design thing , is it david ? <EOS> okay um as for the case , kind of discussed that <EOS>
can you go back uh one slide ? <EOS> i'm not sure , how do i <EOS> oh , i know , let's see . <EOS> let's go back up here . <EOS> thank you . yeah . <EOS> yes , uh <EOS> question , uh , what's mean exactly , advanced chip on print ? <EOS> what's the meaning of that ? <EOS>
and , in order to make it really sellable we've gotta shorten the learning curve , make sure it's really intuitive and easy to use . <EOS> we have to have as few buttons as possible , <EOS> because more buttons is more confusion , <EOS> so that's why i'm saying , simplicity is good . <EOS> finding it's important , obviously you can't use it if you can't find it . <EOS> so we've gotta concentrate on the features that help you find it , <EOS> and i've already said this several times but i put it down in writing here , <EOS> it should be an attractive impulse purchase at twenty five euros . <EOS> so it has to have enough value that when somebody looks at it they say , uh twenty five euros i'm not gonna take that . <EOS> has to be so great that they're gonna say , uh twenty five euros isn't much . <EOS> um and then maybe a motto , like we put fashion in electronics might be something we can use in our marketing campaign . <EOS> okay that's uh about it for me right now . <EOS>
yeah , it's true , <EOS> but , you know , they're features that users want , <EOS> so it's <EOS> and our production cost of twelve fifty euros per per unit is fairly high i think , <EOS> so i think we can afford to to add these sort of features into our remote . <EOS>
it's like a t okay , it's like a timer it's like a lock to the television . <EOS> timer , yeah , mm-hmm , mm-hmm . <EOS> timer . yeah and then you can use a timer as well . <EOS> yes . <EOS> yeah that's it . <EOS> uh okay , <EOS> now i have <EOS> on my slide show basically we already we have already done the agenda , <EOS> and uh on the closing uh basically there will be lunch break and all that . <EOS> however uh the decision we have to take in this meeting is who is our target group . <EOS> and uh what function , working design , how how does it work . <EOS> so these are the two things we should come up wit with . <EOS> so uh the first thing is pro maybe a little easier on uh who is our target group . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i don't think you need the power , <EOS> so <EOS> what's that ? <EOS> no , that's okay that's okay . <EOS> i don't need the powerpoint ? <EOS> no , the power cord itself . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> so then you have a bit more freedom to <EOS>
mm <EOS> . okay , yes <EOS> yes . <EOS> if c you envisioning it ? <EOS> and so that stays the same when you have the logo , <EOS> and then you have this s slip that kinda clips in and that's the bit that changes . <EOS> okay . <EOS>
yes . <EOS> um-hmm . <EOS> twenty-five percent of the market to get to two million units . <EOS> at two million units , we have to have a profit of twenty-five euro per unit to get to the fifty million unit eu euro profit . <EOS> okay ? <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yep . <EOS>
mm-hmm mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah , like <EOS> mm-hmm mm-hmm mm-hmm . <EOS> so it means design should be similar to the traditional ones ? <EOS> little sleek , longer ? <EOS> no no <EOS> i was thinking of so like something <EOS> yeah . <EOS> and it should fit the hand . <EOS>
and one five . <EOS> oh , three sixes , okay , yeah . <EOS> fifty one , one , two , three , four , five , six , seven , eight . <EOS> okay , twenty eight , thirty eight , fo forty six . forty six and five , fifty one . <EOS> fifty one divided by <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> i think it can't be implemented , <EOS> but maybe <EOS> you could use that n as an option , if you have money left , or something . <EOS> yeah , 's an option , yes . <EOS> yeah , sure , indeed . <EOS> fifty euro cents . <EOS>
no , <EOS> single curve . <EOS> okay , <EOS> case material supplements . plastic , wood , rubber , titanium , special colour . <EOS> we had the special colour . <EOS> i <EOS> i just wanna say plastic . <EOS> and did we say plastic ? <EOS> yeah , <EOS> can we do some what ifs , <EOS> 'cause it may <EOS> i mean i i still quite like the idea of combining plastic and rubber myself , <EOS> but it depends on the cost , i guess . <EOS>
yes , okay . <EOS> uh-huh . <EOS> so that will be the safe , <EOS> so p any the chip <EOS> it's not on the chip because you need to have microphone to <EOS> no , i mean it depends on the design of the circuit board . <EOS> yes . <EOS>
it's a very basic minimal thing <EOS> which you can <EOS> which is which is also available in the market , <EOS> actually that's what it that it i <EOS> and would cost us to build it about eight euros . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah . yeah . yeah . <EOS>
of the researchers studying this . <EOS> it's all p goes into their corpus . <EOS> though it would have been nice to be able to transfer the um <EOS> it must <EOS> transfer our n our paper notes onto the uh computer ourselves . <EOS> yeah , that woulda been pretty good . <EOS>
'kay . <EOS> oh , <EOS> well let's go ahead and , <EOS> back , previous . <EOS> so what i wanna do right now is hear from all three of you , on your research that you just did . <EOS> who would like to start us off ? <EOS>
oh . okay . <EOS> right . <EOS> well yeah . <EOS> if we're talking about the area just <EOS> oh i d <EOS> i dunno . <EOS> i guess we'd have to contact the company that makes them and see . <EOS> um so what else ? <EOS> there's plastic for that area around the button . <EOS> um and then rubber would be the squishy like thing right ? <EOS> um and lots of special colours actually . <EOS> uh scroll wheel . <EOS> do you see anything that i've missed ? <EOS>
yeah it's two different situations <EOS> . if you really need an universal remote control or if you would change your remote control for a n for a new one . <EOS> yeah that's two different question . <EOS> if i had t if i had to spend twenty five euro , if that was like my limit , maybe i would buy it . <EOS> because the other twenty five euro remote controls are probably gonna look <EOS>
the tool training is to try out the white board , <EOS> so <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> maybe someone ha we have to this whiteboard , <EOS> yeah ? <EOS> maybe you can draw your favourite animal <EOS> and make a list of its favourite characteristics . <EOS> so <EOS> right now ? <EOS>
then we can make add two colours on it . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> two colours it . <EOS> special c <EOS> okay , <EOS> if you lose uh if you lose the <EOS> switch colours . <EOS> it was such a great idea . <EOS> you lose this one , you got eleven point five <EOS> and you make i and then you can make uh the spec single curve , for example . <EOS>
i mean yeah , it's for the um industrial design and users interface designers to decide if it's going to be working or not . <EOS> mm . <EOS> for our next product , our new t_v_ set with uh automatical uh sound adjustment light <EOS> i think <EOS> yeah , then we can conclude that . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> rotated , <EOS> so it can so so so that it can be adjusted to either left or right handed user . <EOS> um so <EOS> the t uh the top function button in basic mode would be the on off switch <EOS> and menu mode would be the enter button . <EOS> and then the bottom function buttons switches between between modes . <EOS> um now <EOS> programming it <EOS> actually thi this is one thing i've found with um the replacement remote control . <EOS> programming them can be a right pain . <EOS> so i thought th the simplest way around that would be to have um a cable to connect it to the computer <EOS> some some fair iv fairly fairly simple software on the computer just so that you on your computer <EOS> just so that you could um pr program it at a rather in a rather more comfortable interface . <EOS> and you could download programs for it from uh for uh t_v_s from all sort of main manufacturers . <EOS> um though you i it would be necessary to have uh have a m uh have a ha have a mode for programming it without the computer , <EOS> uh just in case there are there are still people left out there who don't have them yet . <EOS> um . but uh . yeah . <EOS>
thi <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yes . <EOS> me first again or <EOS> yeah . alright . <EOS> did you open it already or <EOS> no . ah . <EOS> who wants to start ? <EOS> yes ? <EOS> yeah sure . doesn't matter . <EOS> oh . no . yeah . no problem <EOS>
number one product . <EOS> mm . <EOS> we can't fail . <EOS> all done , thanks . <EOS> we fitted all the criterias . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> . <EOS> yeah , so <EOS> well done , reissa . <EOS> so that's that one . <EOS> okay , i i think um i just wanna put in as project manager the you know , little bit of praise for everybody here for how they've worked on it , <EOS> you know , both individually and as a team . <EOS> you know you've w everyone's come up with their own individual ideas in their own different departments , <EOS> um and then come together and worked in , you know , integrally , you know , at the right times , <EOS> psp , you know , especially you two . <EOS> that's all , you know , gone very very well <EOS> and and <EOS> and be you know , has been good communication going on . <EOS>
uh , yeah , it's good as well . mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah , that's true . <EOS> um you have we could if we could save <EOS> depending on the cost of the product itself , you know , could we have uh a cheaper b cheaper power source and then just have it annually renewed ? instead of having a ten year guarantee ? <EOS> with interchangeable covers , could just buy a new one every year , a new one when new fashions come out . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so uh yeah . <EOS> that would be a nice uh nice device i guess . <EOS> and which which colour should uh should i give the the display ? uh <EOS> or <EOS> who ? <EOS> i mean , the the colour of the background of the display ? <EOS> ah well i don't guess it s has to be a sixty uh sixty six five thousand uh colour , so yeah too expensive . <EOS> so just just a a blue blue backlight or something like that . <EOS> green is too old-fashioned . but blue , blue's okay . j <EOS>
no i w okay , i'm not that whiny . <EOS> but uh there was a big hole here as well , and there as well . <EOS> oh , that's true . <EOS> uh here . yeah , they're walking behind the walls . <EOS> that's a kinda big mistake . <EOS>
uh . <EOS> we'll see . <EOS> i i really don't like this modelling clay <EOS> 'cause you know it makes some for for <EOS> i dunno uh <EOS> yeah um <EOS> we'll look . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> for creation . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> ah <EOS> you can pretend that it's uh titanium . <EOS>
ah yes . <EOS> yeah , yeah . okay , yeah . <EOS> 'cause it's it's really what people want . <EOS> even if it's in general fashion , we want it to be in the remote control . <EOS> and then uh if if we take the ordering or the ranking of all the points , fancy look and feel has , on a score of seven would have six as importance . <EOS> uh the remote control has to be technologically innovative , it's three . <EOS> then easy to use uh it's not so important actually with respect to other y other ones . <EOS> so we see fancy look an look and feel is the most important one , <EOS> and then if we combine this with the fashion uh from milan and paris <EOS>
ph two phases uh after this , the conceptual design and after that a a more detailed design in which the the final project should get its definite shape . <EOS> alright , <EOS> but first we will do some uh tool training . <EOS> in all in front of you uh you see uh the uh notebooks and w uh n note blocks <EOS> and we have here a a a a white-board . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> well , <EOS> business colours i thought it was the the slogan and uh the corporate image , <EOS> so yeah , it needs colour , <EOS> okay <EOS> they should be m sh they should be in mind , <EOS> wasn't it ? <EOS> but i don't think you have to make the entire thing in the corporate colour . <EOS>
that kind of issue . do we have to initially um , you know looking at the findings here , focus on a younger age group initially and then broaden out the market later . <EOS> do we really have to go for everyone right away ? um . <EOS> mm . <EOS>
cool . <EOS> there's too much gear . <EOS> you can take as long over this as you like , <EOS> because we haven't got an awful lot to discuss . <EOS> ok oh <EOS> we do we do . <EOS> don't feel like you're in a rush , anyway . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> oh no . <EOS> uh , the plus is only for if you're going past the number nine . <EOS> yeah i know , <EOS> but if if i wanna go to say number like sixty five , channel sixty five , if i press the six it'll go to channel six , and then i'll press the plus , and then it'll go to six and then put the five and it'll go to sixty five ? <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> the key , the key um the key of our the key feature of our controller is that it's it has some some um adaptation <EOS> yeah , <EOS> this could be downloaded by the web maybe , <EOS> or <EOS> yeah <EOS> but you know . the product the pro <EOS>
okay . <EOS> maybe make it in the form of a gun . <EOS> we can sell it in united states . <EOS> i have a question uh for you . <EOS> does any of the um the features that pedro's spoken about here have any implications we might not have thought about on in terms of just pure functionality ? <EOS> in terms of making it work or the cost of that or <EOS>
oh course , <EOS> yeah that's true . <EOS> let me get that . <EOS> a bit more . <EOS> okay , <EOS> so what this is is a set-up for us to um uh use a kind of a like a <EOS> you you still have your blue fingers . <EOS>
mm-hm . mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm . <EOS> okay , so <EOS> more time during the individual work phases . <EOS> um okay well uh <EOS> i just got my warning for the last five minutes , <EOS> so i'll move on to i guess my last slide , <EOS> yes , <EOS> which is the closing . <EOS> well uh , <EOS> we managed , <EOS> but we did it very quickly . <EOS> i don't know if that's the best way to when it isn't is it when it is too expensive to quickly re-arrange it and say , okay , this is it , <EOS> but we had to do it , <EOS> huh , <EOS> because we have to have a design , <EOS> and that is within the budget . <EOS> and we evaluated . <EOS> maybe we should re-evaluate uh the product , <EOS> but we did that before , <EOS> and we also evaluated the project . <EOS> and i think uh everybody's uh very happy . at least i am , with the results , <EOS> so uh <EOS> celebration , well , for the three of you , <EOS> because uh i have to write the final report now . <EOS> but uh well , <EOS> thank you very much for your co-operation , <EOS> and i had a very nice day so far . <EOS> okay . <EOS>
that's what a powerpoint presentation is for . it's they're designed specifically to ignore . i it's th brilliant . <EOS> oh , wow . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> it's the five by five , i can't read that much . <EOS> ah yes yes yes okay i see that . <EOS> vomit . <EOS> yes . <EOS> street pizza . <EOS> it's so brilliant . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> sorry . <EOS> sorry , <EOS> carry on . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so <EOS> but also in terms of providing environmental safe products , <EOS> uh yeah like uh keeping uh keeping in mind all the safety issues . <EOS> so <EOS> now comes the criteria rating with seven point scale . <EOS> i'm having this scale this scale , <EOS> so we have to do it on a board . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> well <EOS> from the mouse idea you could , <EOS> remote is a piece of plastic with the big rubber buttons sticking out of it <EOS> which you press , <EOS> whereas if you want <EOS> could all be flat <EOS> and the buttons are very kind of almost subtle <EOS> that instead of being raised out of the device uh you push into device you see , like a mouse button . <EOS>
oh it's so cute . <EOS> i have one thing about it , but it's a small thing , <EOS> but it'd mean we'd have to make a right-handed one and a left-handed one . <EOS> ah , that's good thinking , yeah . <EOS> oh right , yeah . <EOS>
yeah w one of the m key point is solar cells . <EOS> maybe if w t if suppose if we change and we g put just one ? <EOS> has it changed . <EOS> yeah , it was stage one , so . <EOS> no y i it did change , but <EOS> just imagine we have <EOS>
like that . <EOS> okay <EOS> for some strange re reason i had it in my mind that they'd put them down vertically <EOS> but uh uh <EOS> yeah it could stand , yeah . <EOS> well <EOS> we could broaden the broaden it out a bit <EOS> so it would stand like that . <EOS>
yep . okay . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> programmable memory as well . <EOS> the u_s_b_ for which ? <EOS> for the remote control . <EOS> the the idea was that maybe it could connect up for um allowing a software interface on the p_c_ for a larger programming <EOS> due to the fact that we've gone for such a nice , easy minimal design , normally . <EOS>
well , um we had what , eight eight euros twenty as our cost ? <EOS> eight , eight twenty , yes . <EOS> eight twenty so <EOS> and so we've got we've still got four euros to go to spend . <EOS> we have um four euros , yeah <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> well when you stop scrolling the wheel it stops . <EOS> but normally with uh it will just uh s stay on each station briefly so you can see the the picture . <EOS> uh <EOS> uh-huh . <EOS> and we we do have one more functionality . <EOS> if you take the banana as such and uh you press the turbo button , so it switch ons the switch ons the t_v_ . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay michael . <EOS> okay , so , could i describe the mouse maybe <EOS> be easier to <EOS> could i use the mouse , or <EOS> sorry ? <EOS> um yeah . <EOS> mm . thanks . <EOS> okay . <EOS>
uh , and the next slide . <EOS> oh , yeah um , <EOS> if you go to the next slide then . <EOS> i just used the <EOS> it was a mess , <EOS> uh i was just putting adding it together at the end there . uh <EOS> oh . <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
it sh it takes a few seconds i think . <EOS> you may need to <EOS> who's that ? <EOS> no . <EOS> . is it in the right thing ? <EOS> but sometimes you have to do it <EOS> it's like a three set setting cycle , so press it a couple times , hold down function and then press f_ eight . <EOS>
the whole desire of our c real reaction company wanting to focus on fashion <EOS> and so , <EOS> even though we're stressing , when we're talking , we've all been talking about this like simplicity and easy to use idea , <EOS> they're sort of wanting us to remember that the number one thing for everyone is that it's fancy look and feel . <EOS> and as these are ranked , the top one is doubly important to the second one , <EOS> which is doubly important to the third one , <EOS> so just to take that weight into account . <EOS>
yeah i think so . <EOS> he gave you the liberty to talk as you wants . <EOS> fine yes uh . <EOS> yeah that's right . <EOS> yeah that's right . <EOS> uh the teamwork was very very good . <EOS> i was really i am very satisfying to work with with you . <EOS>
well you can have it on the settings , <EOS> no ? <EOS> yeah , that you can flip over , yeah , yeah . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> but , i mean , do you need that ? <EOS> if if you can get to , you know if <EOS> so long as you're able to bring up the menu on the t_v_ screen . <EOS> that keeps it <EOS>
the ti the start time , all the p all the programmes <EOS> you could have uh o <EOS> you could have a l even a little image of you know the c you know the the m the main actors or something <EOS> so you can quickly just kind of even without reading <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> no <EOS> you you <EOS> i think you will use it only on the right or left hand , whether you are righty or lefty . <EOS> i think for lefty it's okay . <EOS> i can do this movement , <EOS> and for righty as well . <EOS> i think this doesn't change that much . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> y in that case maybe the maybe the speech recognition the speech thing could be useful just to say i'm here <EOS> but uh it's probably a bit of overkill if you could just have a a beeping <EOS> mm . <EOS> exactly yeah . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> oh yeah . <EOS> right . <EOS> we do have a budget limitation that we can't control ourselves , <EOS> so i think when we can take a cheaper option which still does the same kinda thing <EOS> um because it is something i <EOS> it needs to be the thing that you
yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so <EOS> it was a bit of both really , <EOS> we just kind of started out by each taking a colour of clay and just fooling around with it <EOS> and i came up with that rhombus shape <EOS> and he came up with the sort of potatoey , mangoey shape , <EOS> and then just went from there really . <EOS>
all ready . <EOS> apparently i'm old as well . <EOS> thirty's really young , eh ? <EOS> we do . <EOS> i'm gonna open . <EOS> i'm gonna talk for a bit about what we're gonna do . <EOS> i'm gonna take some notes . <EOS> we're gonna all do a presentation , <EOS> and then hopefully we're gonna make some decisions now . <EOS> yep . <EOS> well when i say hopefully , we have to . so <EOS>
okay . <EOS> okay , so <EOS> just for you guys just one of you can draw a painting if you want . <EOS> let me try one . <EOS> just don't <EOS> um yeah , <EOS> just u use it like that , <EOS> yeah . that's okay . <EOS>
few questions about a spongy remote control . i've never seen one before . <EOS> i've seen plastic remote controls . <EOS> i think maybe they were <EOS> i don't know , <EOS> back in the day when they first came up with remote controls , they had a reason for it being <EOS>
uh-huh . <EOS> that could also be built into the t_v_ though , which might make our remote control a bit obsolete . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> it might do us out of a job . <EOS> um <EOS> well , hopefully we're uh we're ahead of the curve . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> also <EOS> as well for the for the older people ? <EOS> yeah , as well <EOS> as your <EOS> if you're fif sixty years old , you're holding one of those things in your hand <EOS> uh sure . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> but uh <EOS> yeah , <EOS> but they they don't want the uh extra options , <EOS> right ? <EOS> so <EOS>
yeah <EOS> becau because you have <EOS> yeah . <EOS> your thumb here . <EOS> yeah okay , true , true , true true . <EOS> but not on the screen because <EOS> yeah <EOS> that's uh that's an idea . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> looks a bit like a game boy now . <EOS>
maybe i've got my hand in the popcorn bowl and i'm holding my cup of coca-cola in the other hand . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> and you don't wanna let go of either one . <EOS> i don't wanna say . louder . yeah . <EOS> i mean it doesn't have to be on the flip , <EOS> it can be on the side somewhere . <EOS>
yeah . uh . we should probably just use conventional batteries . um , just like in usual remote controls . <EOS> which i suppose as well would allow us to go off the shelf again , you'd say ? <EOS> um . yeah . <EOS> um . and these are three different types of or two different types three different types of shapes you can have . <EOS> uh one is a flat one , <EOS> and then more original ones are single curved one or one with a double curved . <EOS> um the materials are tha there as you can see , <EOS> but uh you can't have a titanium one for a double curved , <EOS> uh which would be <EOS>
yeah . um i dunno if you can open the <EOS> uh m is not here . <EOS> i dunno if i can open it . <EOS> maybe you can s <EOS> it's <EOS> uh in <EOS> yeah okay . <EOS> no . <EOS> messenger no ? <EOS> in document . <EOS> mm <EOS> computer yeah . <EOS>
uh important is that we use different colours , and uh different pen widths . widths . widths . <EOS> yes ? <EOS> i have a question . <EOS> um this exercise , um did the company board tell you to do it , <EOS> or uh did you just make it up yourself ? <EOS>
yeah . so <EOS> it's it's interesting information , i think . <EOS> and then um yeah , the remote controls like the one you've shown previously it's not so doesn't fit the user requirements sometime , <EOS> because it's too many buttons and so on . <EOS> so <EOS> we should change this as well . <EOS> and uh users are actually zapping a lot , <EOS> so they're using the device intensively , <EOS> that's something to take into account as well . <EOS> and um , you know , <EOS> ten percent of the buttons are actually used in the remote control . <EOS> and uh this is one of the main point for me . <EOS> but i'll come back to it later . <EOS> 'kay . <EOS> could you go next slide ? <EOS> uh , so as you said uh , <EOS> remote controls are often lost somewhere in the room . <EOS>
we're not entirely sure what single-curve versus double-cur <EOS> it's single-curved , <EOS> yeah . <EOS> you think ? <EOS> okay <EOS> i'm convinced . <EOS> but we save one euro that way , yeah ? <EOS> so we come bring it down to fifteen point four . <EOS> see it's a little bit more than f single-curved . <EOS> so yeah it's fifteen point eight , <EOS> that's where we came up with it . <EOS>
yeah <EOS> that would depend upon us actually . <EOS> yeah yeah yeah . <EOS> and the we we can decide decide between th those designs . yep . <EOS> yeah okay . <EOS> i think that would be a good idea . so <EOS> anyone uh any questions for now ? <EOS>
so possibly like a uh , <EOS> sorry , <EOS> just to butt in for a second . <EOS> possibly uh like a cover like they have for mobile phones ? <EOS> alright . <EOS> that's what i was thinking yeah . <EOS> those like , yeah , sort of spongy ones . <EOS>
no the arrow's over here . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah <EOS> and then numbers . <EOS> buttons . <EOS> yeah . alright . <EOS> okay . <EOS> i think that uh it's a nice design . <EOS> it's cool . <EOS> uh pretty nice design . yeah . <EOS> yeah it looks uh pretty fancy . <EOS>
but , that's i don't see why that's not possible . <EOS> yeah , if we build rocket ships why can't we build left-handed and right-handed uh remotes . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> they make left-handed scissors , you know . <EOS> yeah , i didn't i didn't think about that , but i'd yeah , . <EOS>
or um something they only described as the type of battery you find in torches from about fifty years ago , flashlights . <EOS> not quite sure what that is , <EOS> but that's the description that i received , <EOS> so that's what i'm passing on to you . <EOS> so those are our options . <EOS>
right . mm . <EOS> or like you h you see those you know people <EOS> i'm thinking of like celebrity cribs kind of things when like they have all those these things that at their house you know <EOS> their their entire house is so electronic , <EOS> and they have like this one master control that <EOS> and it's like a hand held like turns on everything sort of control <EOS> and it has like a screen and like <EOS> so i think it should be possible to have some kind of a screen , <EOS> i don't know if it must be it would probably <EOS> must be ex too expensive though t <EOS> like i dunno . <EOS>
yeah <EOS> well <EOS> like l li like some like some some remotes who are out there , which i know , there's one button which is very easy to switch between devices . <EOS> so you can switch to your video <EOS> and then the same buttons control your video . <EOS> and another function i'll think of switch to your media centre , <EOS> because that's getting very popular . <EOS> and then use your windows media centre under your t_v_ with the same remote control . so with the switch , one single switch <EOS>
this is quite fun actually . <EOS> wow . <EOS> has anybo oh . <EOS> has anybody pressed okay , <EOS> it vibrates . <EOS> it's pretty cool . <EOS> mm . <EOS> i really don't <EOS> yeah , yeah . <EOS> wow you've your first page . <EOS> i was just writing really big . <EOS>
i think <EOS> see i'm having i'm having trouble imagining <EOS> the <EOS> is it uh gonna be the size , like the the controller ? <EOS> it <EOS> or bigger ? <EOS> i think the wheel would probably be mm . <EOS> because <EOS> what if we just smash all the vegetables down flat ? <EOS> and like then it you could hold it in your hand better . <EOS>
ah . <EOS> okay . so <EOS> this is our working design presentation . <EOS> um i had a bit of some issues with this , <EOS> because i wasn't able to find everything i needed , <EOS> but i guess that's we're still in early stages . <EOS> um so , yeah , <EOS> this is this . <EOS> though th the thing about working design is the <EOS> what we're trying to do as a working design is figure out how the aparata apparatus can fulfil its function . <EOS> um one of the examples that kept coming up for me is that a coffee grinder . <EOS> it works <EOS> because it converts electrical energy to grinding the beans <EOS> and then you put the bean through a filter <EOS> and that filters out , <EOS> and then you get coffee at the end that's nice and hot <EOS> because of the combination of electrical energy and then the other things that are brought in to make it work . <EOS> don't know if i'm explaining that very well , <EOS> but how do i get to the next s <EOS> ah . <EOS> so <EOS> h the method as <EOS> um working designers figure out what you need to make it fulfil this practical function , <EOS> what what needs to be done <EOS> and how do we convert all the elements to make that done . <EOS> so <EOS> wha <EOS> the easiest thing to do is to break down all the points <EOS>
i think that might scare me . <EOS> i think that'd probably scare me . <EOS> you turn it on your control possessed s . <EOS> i know . <EOS> um unless an a i mean if you <EOS> also would that work if we wanted to incorporate um an l_c_d_ display , where would we put that ? <EOS> would we put that on the inside or <EOS>
so let's remove it . <EOS> yeah ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah but <EOS> yeah <EOS> but you have the same programme on the t_v_ screen . <EOS> but <EOS> yes exactly . <EOS> this is the problem . <EOS> no <EOS> on the t_v_ you don't it doesn't display on the t_v_ now . <EOS>
so <EOS> okay . <EOS> um okay , <EOS> how about if i uh pass this back to you <EOS> and i'll uh figure out the average here . <EOS> yep . <EOS> right . <EOS> thank you for everyone's help with that . <EOS> right . <EOS> and as you can see it says the same thing , <EOS> it had not lost itself , <EOS> thank goodness . <EOS>
well now that we've decided on our <EOS> w we're gonna s supplement it with anything , <EOS> you know , colours or particular gimmicky bits to it , <EOS> we're not we're just gonna go for something <EOS> um it seems like we wouldn't wanna make it too busy and too sort of gaudy , <EOS> but um <EOS>
oh <EOS> well done yeah , yeah oh ok <EOS> nice . <EOS> do we need to worry about um rot factors ? <EOS> um it's encased in a new uh type of uh <EOS> oh okay , <EOS> there's preservatives involved , <EOS> we don't need to worry , <EOS> okay . <EOS>
right . so , <EOS> yeah sure . <EOS> i figured , just put 'em all together . <EOS> you got a a caffeine powered space shuttle train transport to your t_v_ , and um <EOS> hmm . <EOS> as for the user interface problem , you know , too many buttons . give it one button <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> wow . that's a lot . <EOS> oh , <EOS> i must admit i hadn't um i'd i'd missed that . <EOS> that does sound excessive . <EOS> but then again , if you think it of the amount of , you know amount of use it's like <EOS>
uh rama . <EOS> ramaro . <EOS> mm . <EOS> so <EOS> what we want to <EOS> the decision we want to take on this meeting are on the um first on the component concept , so what kind of energy we use uh what kind of chip on print and one ki kind of case . <EOS> and also on user interface concept uh what kind of interface we use and if there is some supplements . <EOS> and at the end um sammy will give um a trend watching on what he's he's been doing . <EOS> it's <EOS> so , <EOS> let's go . <EOS> first with rama . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> and i think that the plastic cover is not very good uh idea because <EOS> okay . <EOS> you open it , it can break , you ca you can do various things . <EOS> uh you just need to put the channel numbers somewhere a bit out of the way . <EOS>
fall over . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> 's a little longer . <EOS> wee <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> what's on the next one ? <EOS> oh right yes , <EOS> let's have a look at the um f finance . <EOS> um , now <EOS> we're given a a clear design brief , uh <EOS> if i get the uh spreadsheet up . <EOS> oh . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah . okay . <EOS> mm . <EOS> . <EOS> function . <EOS> yeah , but well what about the the new project's requirement ? <EOS> i i i think we should give up with teletext , no ? <EOS> i think we we can we <EOS> is the . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> does that <EOS> um would that include um access to say interactive functions on digital or cable ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i would say so , yes , <EOS> because then we have to be able to control the remote boxes , <EOS> and that is a separate unit . <EOS> um i think that it <EOS> i would say that the design spec we've been with is for the television only for now . <EOS> and until we hear otherwise we should go with just that . <EOS>
i i know . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah , maybe we have to integrate that as well . if it's possible . <EOS> but <EOS> if it's possible , <EOS> i dunno . <EOS> i didn't read it . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> i don't know . <EOS> i don't think it's very expensive actually . <EOS> why should it ? <EOS> you only have a microphone in it . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah , it's cool . yep . <EOS> and still trans <EOS> like fronts in in red and yellow and blue <EOS> and <EOS> yes . <EOS> so <EOS> oh yeah . <EOS> still still transparent . <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah . but with all with logo on it . <EOS>
. <EOS> okay . so um <EOS> due to your hard work , we might as well let the uh two designers go first , <EOS> and uh show us the prototype . <EOS> okay , <EOS> it's a <EOS> quite how the best way to do this is , i'm not sure , <EOS> but <EOS>
okay . <EOS> fantastic . <EOS> okay . <EOS> um <EOS> yeah . <EOS> any extra features we add beyond the basic ones should be m hidden , <EOS> they shouldn't be on the um <EOS> shouldn't be visible without something be opened or some sort of special extra effort . <EOS> um if we did decide to go for voice activation there sh should always be a button as alternative , <EOS> possibly hidden in the the opened up section <EOS> um making that something is wrong with it or with somebody's voice , maybe they got a cold or <EOS>
oh , that'd be lovely . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> i guess we can interpret it like , we can just try out different types of speech recognition within our remote programme . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> didn't they um didn't our rival companies manufacture a remote that you would press the button on the t_v_ and it would the remote would beep so if you have lost it <EOS>
mm yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> are we supposed to say nice things about jen now ? <EOS> and presumably you don't <EOS> you can say nasty things as well . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i was i was satisfied with with the leadership , yeah . <EOS> i have no stake in it . <EOS>
well you just it's one extra button . <EOS> you say programme start , and then type in <EOS> 'cause you still have the typing you know you'll still have the keypad where you can type 'em in manually . <EOS> so programme start , zero , one , enter , zero , five , enter , thirty eight , enter , programme end . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> right . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yes . <EOS> by your child , mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> uh t the remote should be compact <EOS> and it should ha it should have as many buttons as possible for controlling different functionalities of the t_v_ television . <EOS> and um uh as uh uh this is my personal preference that it should be in the shape of a t_ in alphabet for more compactability . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> well no , not not you , <EOS> you can finish your slides before <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay , <EOS> so . anyway , users'll be <EOS> so the findings is users'll be very interested in our locator device to find their misplaced remotes . <EOS> so that was very <EOS> i thought it's a very good suggestion by everybody . <EOS> that's it . <EOS> yep . <EOS>
well . <EOS> yeah intelligent . <EOS> i've i've uh <EOS> eraser . <EOS> with an e_ . <EOS> you can try out the eraser now . <EOS> pen . <EOS> well not perfect , but okay . <EOS> okay , well <EOS> thank you very much . <EOS> i can see we have some uh drawing talent uh in this group , <EOS> huh ? <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> shall we wait 'til i've 'til i've showed you what well , my extensive presentation on what sort of interfaces are available . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yep . <EOS> thank you , kate . <EOS> thank you , kate . <EOS>
the buttons are rubber . <EOS> okay . right . <EOS> so let's see if that comes within budget . <EOS> and it does . <EOS> that is gonna cost uh <EOS> yeah . <EOS> that's gonna cost ten ten euro seventy cents a unit to make . <EOS> and our target was it had to come in at under twelve fifty . <EOS> so , <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah , even i have . <EOS> yeah , even i have , i think , yeah . <EOS> yes . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> 'kay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> alright , well uh <EOS> yeah , so let's see . <EOS> then uh we see you in about thirty minutes . <EOS> and see what we can come up with . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> say that we have a seven point scale , from one to seven , <EOS> and for each of the product you could just give me the scale according to this . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> so now you have with l_c_d_ and without l_c_d_ , <EOS> so on this scale , if it is true , if it is if it has a fancy look you could just tell me one , <EOS>
i dunno . <EOS> i like the idea of the <EOS> i mean <EOS> that's really gotten the simplicity of the buttons down , that one . <EOS> i think i'm leaning towards the potato . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> i am worried about like um using a menu . <EOS> um in that <EOS> like <EOS> i <EOS> withing menus there are submenus , <EOS> and so how do you get back to the main menu ? <EOS>
i guess . <EOS> um . <EOS> it did it just say in an email that we need to discuss that ? <EOS> new ideas . <EOS> is it <EOS> well , <EOS> that's the thing i got i in the email i got this powerpoint file <EOS> but this slide was just there , <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> i didn't change this one at all . <EOS>
vegetables . mushroom is a vegetable . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i don't think it is . <EOS> it's vegetable . <EOS> mushroom ? <EOS> oh , uh i'm not sure . <EOS> we can <EOS> it's a veg a kind of vegetable , <EOS> but you know we we integrated them with different colour . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> oh . i <EOS> uh , sorry ? <EOS> i know where it is . <EOS> it's on the desktop . <EOS> it's uh <EOS> technical function . <EOS> okay . <EOS> yes . <EOS> it's uh <EOS> like so . <EOS> well . so um <EOS> i'm going to talk a little bit about the technical function <EOS> so wha what actually it's about what is the user going to do , <EOS> i think my last presented what is going inside , <EOS> so what's the user is going to see from the outside <EOS> and how he is going to use it . <EOS> so well <EOS> the approach is that uh <EOS>
okay . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> okay , now the things that i was thinking and th my wish list has really been realised in this prototype . <EOS> i wanted the shape to be biomorphic , i didn't want anything with angles and all square , i wanted it to be comfy and roundy <EOS> so we we've got that . <EOS> the size is small , <EOS> the colour's bright and warm which is what we wanted . <EOS> we wanted the feel to be as soft as possible , <EOS> we'll have the soft buttons <EOS> and the way this is shaped , even though it's gonna be hard plastic , it feels good in your hand <EOS> so that's nice . <EOS> and functionality i put last on my list because people aren't going to use it before they buy it . <EOS> so paradoxically the other features , in other words , the look , the feel um and the shape , that's what people are gonna get in the store . <EOS> they don't have a television in the store , they can't play with it . <EOS>
alright . <EOS> i can go first , <EOS> yeah . <EOS> you wanna go first ? <EOS> okay , <EOS> so we need to unplug my laptop <EOS> and plug in yours . <EOS> okay . hmm . <EOS> i assume we just pull it out ? <EOS> mm . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> that's <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> different . <EOS> stands out . <EOS> or <EOS> oh yeah a one hand uh solution . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so from top view it looks kinda like this . <EOS> but from the side you you can have it also in a kind of shape . <EOS> maybe because the the screen is on top you can have <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> it's it it <EOS> technical aspects . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> so i take three on with l_c_d_ ? <EOS> so without l_c_d_ how would you rate it ? <EOS> yeah a three . <EOS> uh four . <EOS> i think it's it's uh more easy to make f fancy things when it's not complicated <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> i think the if we do the cover that's really going with the company's philosophy of having the fashion in in electronics , <EOS> it lets people have the latest fashion <EOS> even next year when fruit and vegetables might be out , you'll still be able to put a new cover on it <EOS> and then it'll still be in fashion . <EOS>
re relevance . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> turn off the t_v_ . <EOS> if if you like this , <EOS> okay . b okay . <EOS> because , well it's maybe question for you t <EOS> i think we need to concentrate on the , you know , the major usage of the th of the control , <EOS> which is you sit down , you turn on your t_v_ , you change channels , you change the volume , you turn the t_v_ off . <EOS> um and all the other f functionality is <EOS>
which i think is a really good idea . <EOS> but we can implement it with simple push buttons , <EOS> which is much cheaper . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> like up , down , left and right . <EOS> which is good . <EOS> and then and then <EOS> yeah , so i mean <EOS> either a channel up and down , volume up and down , next appearing programmes up and down , uh and then also when you get into the different menus on the screen , it's got your things like settings and contrast up and down . <EOS> so all you really need is these four buttons with the enter in the middle . <EOS>
well there's ano <EOS> but <EOS> well not n necessarily . <EOS> you could basically make it so that it'll i mean it's just gonna be sending a signal to the t_v_ yeah the t_v_'s ge so if you send about five flip channels , if you did that it's gonna flip once . <EOS> if you do that . <EOS>
oh yeah , <EOS> regions and stuff , yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> well for a remote control , do you think that will be <EOS> i suppose it's depends on how complicated our remote control is . <EOS> um . <EOS> i don't know . <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
well , <EOS> i think they are . <EOS> the options are it uh little bit harder , <EOS> but if you touch the options then it's uh <EOS> yeah . <EOS> take a harder look , <EOS> yeah , sure . <EOS> i think th it's <EOS> it's easier than the regular uh remote control . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> no okay , we just put it in , <EOS> because it's a good feature . <EOS> we have to stop now . <EOS> okay , <EOS> just <EOS> we have to stop it now . <EOS> no worries about the cost , etcetera . and there's a chip in it that will <EOS> okay . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> for the company and the colours . <EOS> and so , <EOS> for my personal preferences , i think this one is easier to use <EOS> and has quite a you know , fewer buttons . <EOS> um we want something that sends messages easily to the television <EOS> and i was kind of wondering about this example that they have . <EOS> it looks kind of narrow at the top , <EOS> and i was thinking maybe if it were wider at the top , <EOS> then that would be easier . <EOS>
who starts ? <EOS> so wait a minute oh . <EOS> ha . <EOS> okay . <EOS> so i dunno if i can do that like this ? yeah ? <EOS> . mm . so <EOS> it's being modified . <EOS> do you want yeah , open . read only . <EOS> i hope i saved it . <EOS> so , um <EOS> yeah , <EOS> this is my name . <EOS>
'cause we've only got five channels . <EOS> exactly . <EOS> that's another thing . <EOS> um seventy five per cent of users say they zap . <EOS> not quite sure what they mean , zap , goes like . <EOS> i think that's k flicking quickly between channels . <EOS>
ah <EOS> that's it , <EOS> yep . <EOS> and then you have to press function f_ eight <EOS> i think it is on your laptop . <EOS> function , f_ eight , yeah . <EOS> where's function ? <EOS> the blue one , f_n_ . <EOS> no signal . <EOS>
great . <EOS> so . <EOS> okay . <EOS> so , what else ? <EOS> and for the power source we are having solar cells and rechargeable batteries <EOS> and this and uh the basis station is going to have the input from the mm power line for for charging the batteries . <EOS>
oh yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> actually that just raises a point , <EOS> i wonder what our design people think , <EOS> but you know on a mobile phone , you can press a key and it gives you a menu , it's got a menu display , <EOS> i wonder if incorporating that into the design of a remote control might be useful , <EOS> so you've got a little l_c_d_ display . <EOS>
right , yeah . <EOS> yeah , that's true . yeah . <EOS> um so maybe that could be built into one of the things and it comes up on the t_v_ or something . <EOS> and this one , the over-sized one , <EOS> i don't know about you , but i think it's a bit too gimmicky . <EOS> i don't think that will sell very well . <EOS>
oh . <EOS> oh <EOS> no , <EOS> this is just one big document , <EOS> so you can leave that wherever it is . <EOS> and we have a evaluation left here . <EOS> okay . <EOS> oh , <EOS> okay . <EOS> hmm hmm . <EOS> agenda . <EOS>
w what <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay so <EOS> in that case you can even look at the technology what the mobile phone is trying to use with the card . <EOS> exactly yeah , for customizing and yeah . <EOS> yeah <EOS> where they do all the wi with with them actually . <EOS> how f cost effective it would be to put that car chip into it and do the programmable things . <EOS>
yes . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> maybe we could um have better instructions with the remote . <EOS> or are we just doing the design of the remote control itself , <EOS> or sort of the instructions that would come with it ? <EOS> better instructions . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> good . <EOS> so this prototype is quite nice . <EOS> because i saw uh some phones that were banana shaped , uh wireless phones not mobile ones , wireless for the house , <EOS> uh quite big also , <EOS> and they were selling something like a hundred euros , two hundred euros . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> that's true , yeah . <EOS> right . <EOS> and one of the survey findings was that they want it easy to use , so i think i'm not sure about the l_c_d_ . <EOS> it's a it's great , it's a good idea , <EOS> but for our budget and for the thing we're trying to go for eas easy to use , it's not the thing we should go for , i think . <EOS>
so <EOS> that is true . <EOS> yeah that's true that's right . <EOS> uh maybe we can first um listen to your presentation ? <EOS> uh and then we have a little discussion about the requirements and uh design . <EOS> we would have . <EOS> to look into that .
yeah , <EOS> you can <EOS> well i <EOS> yeah , click o actually click on to have <EOS> zap . <EOS> okay . <EOS> we could we could even have four buttons , <EOS> like , if that's the if that's the mouse , you could have the volume and the channel changers just like on that as well . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> oh yeah . <EOS> oh , the . <EOS> like ma <EOS> we we could have for example two buttons like simple mode and advanced mode . <EOS> or i dunno . <EOS> or like children and grandfather's mode , <EOS> and the , well the the user <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah , already having the formatted stuff helped a lot . <EOS> very much so . <EOS> cool . <EOS> and i think your leadership was quite good . <EOS> it was really good yeah . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> she said i i i <EOS> she actually made a comment off <EOS> boy you're getting into this <EOS> and i really i think it's true <EOS> i did get i i felt like i got way too into it . <EOS>
so it's half of the selling price , if i am good in mathematics . <EOS> yes , of course . <EOS> uh um i mean <EOS> we still have to uh to make a profit , <EOS> huh ? <EOS> of course . <EOS> they have to sell at least four million to make a profit <EOS>
drop it . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> for our remote control . <EOS> um it's poss it's also possible to uh create fancy colours with rubber . <EOS> uh rubber l makes it easy to uh to to it lets lets itself colour . <EOS> uh titanium uh you have to paint it <EOS> and with that uh it's possible to scratch it <EOS> or uh yeah make it ugly . <EOS> uh rubber uh the total uh piece of rubber that's sor uh that's that's used uh to make the case is uh the same colour , <EOS> so if you scratch it it's still the same colour , <EOS> perhaps uh it's a little bit damaged . <EOS> but it's a very strong material . <EOS>
not the case . <EOS> uh the case would only be in that uh aluminium uh titanium stuff , <EOS> like <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm . <EOS> because apparently from your survey people like colours , <EOS> no ? <EOS> yeah , <EOS> well <EOS> they like uh something which is uh <EOS>
yes . <EOS> yeah true . <EOS> but i mean d just those whistling , clapping key rings you have . they're cheap . <EOS> so it can't be that <EOS> annoying alarm or something ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> it's it's <EOS> um the <EOS> it's based on this anti anti-theft technology for suitcases and stuff , <EOS> where you have one piece that's attached to your luggage , another piece that starts beeping . <EOS> that can't cost much . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> right uh . <EOS> okay so can we close that ? <EOS> this is what it's the final spec that it's gonna be . <EOS> someone is gonna have to <EOS> yeah that's fine that's fine . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> um it's probably just <EOS> i dunno if it's worth getting into , <EOS> but um just in in that we want this to be stylish , should we think a little bit more out of the box in terms of a button grid , <EOS> because i've seen there's lots of devices out there that that instead of taking your standard nine nine square grid , and they have it sort of stylized or in different concept that that <EOS>
uh d you can you can tell on on the like <EOS> i think she has given her views on the basis of design , because she was our i interface expert . <EOS> but you can give your views based on technology , <EOS> whether the technology meets the requirements of the customers or not ? <EOS>
i could <EOS> the v the rhombus rhombus ? <EOS> that's the rhombus , yep . <EOS> it's a <EOS> how can i present it ? <EOS> it's an ergonomic shape , <EOS> so it it fits in your hand nicely . um <EOS> it's designed to be used either in your left hand or or in your right hand . <EOS> um i've gone here just for just for four buttons on this one . um <EOS> the two blue buttons here are for adjusting the volume . <EOS> so you've got volume up and volume down on the other side here . <EOS> um the red ones are for uh changing channels , <EOS> channel up and channel down <EOS> and that's um moves between your favourite channels that you've selected . <EOS> uh this middle button here brings up the on-screen menu <EOS> and when you're working in the on-screen menu you use the other four buttons to navigate around the menu system and the middle button uh to select <EOS> and that's basically it , that's the potato . <EOS>
for the flip phone . <EOS> hinged , yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah i th <EOS> uh . <EOS> yeah in in titanium i don't i don't think it would be available at all really , <EOS> the ju just <EOS> it w well you could make it available in the titanium , <EOS> it was just it would be so expensive to buy a new case for it , because of the expense of how much titanium is is <EOS> it's light and strong <EOS> but i think it should be left for aircraft design rather than for <EOS>
what do you mean the function ? <EOS> i mean like okay , 'cause so <EOS> i dunno , i guess okay <EOS> so when you g scroll your thumb like around it , it'll s like say you're go you're going clockwise . <EOS> that that means you're gonna go up the channels , <EOS> and then you scroll the other way and it'll go down . <EOS> but then <EOS> so if you wanna switch to the to u do you have to switch to a function where <EOS>
okay . um <EOS> no no that's um <EOS> i think we should look at the ones that like where s where people said four , where um it looks like we might wanna discuss changing an aspect of the remote . <EOS> i didn't know how else to do it . <EOS> okay . <EOS> well the worst ones were three point one . <EOS>
well <EOS> what uh i was uh thinking about was um uh keep the general functions uh like they are . <EOS> so uh <EOS> like uh the on-off uh button . uh keep it uh yeah l like a red button . <EOS> uh everybody everybody knows it <EOS> so uh uh you don't have to change that . um <EOS> my personal uh preferences um . <EOS> use a display for uh specific uh functions of the different uh device . <EOS> so um <EOS> wh what i was th uh thinking about was um you've got um uh this the remote control uh <EOS> and uh you got here the general functions , uh like uh the on-off button uh sound uh i dunno um <EOS> and um here you've got a s kind of a display . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> uh what do we want ? <EOS> if we want um a with uh for example the the telephone for elderly people , we can <EOS> i think <EOS> target the real elderly people . <EOS> i think that would be a <EOS> if we should do something like that it would be a , i think it would be really good for uh for the image of the company . <EOS>
no , not everything . <EOS> oh . <EOS> yeah , everything . <EOS> pen , select select pen . <EOS> pen . <EOS> it wants to know what we do in our spare time . <EOS> okay . <EOS> it's a house . <EOS> a plant ? <EOS> no , it's only you can know it . <EOS>
i think uh everyone listen to each other . <EOS> like marketing said things and then we had to i include them in the design . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> 'kay . <EOS> yeah , what i have to say about uh means . <EOS> the smart board is okay . <EOS> digital pen is horrible . <EOS> i dunno if you use it . <EOS> but if you want to download it to your computer , it's doesn't work . <EOS> no . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> well , it doesn't <EOS> like it doesn't have to be , you know , bluetooth , <EOS> that was just an idea , <EOS> but like it needs do something that , you know , is new . <EOS> whether it's a battery <EOS> it could be something really really minor , you know , like <EOS> but i think we are really keeping to what is already out there , and people've already seen it , people've already got it . <EOS> if we want something new , we need to move away from what we already have <EOS>
mm . <EOS> um . <EOS> interface , oh the interface graphics for the um <EOS> yeah . <EOS> um . well <EOS> i d <EOS> but then if the touch screen thing isn't gonna work out for us that's really a non-issue . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i like the idea of of rubber too <EOS> because it's tends to be associated with being durable , <EOS> something that you can drop and it doesn't matter . <EOS> 'cause so many <EOS> you go to so many houses these days <EOS> and you see broken remote controls . <EOS>
yes , <EOS> further market research will be needed to kind of focus on what that is , <EOS> it's gonna be different for a fifteen year old th for somebody who's sixty <EOS> and also across the world if we're aiming at the international market . <EOS> what is um attractive to a trendy new yorker and what is attractive to a retired south african , i dunno , <EOS> you get the idea . <EOS> it's it's gonna vary around the world . <EOS> at the end of the day , th the engineering design is one thing , <EOS> it's the user interface design that may and th the sort of you know fashionable aspect of it we might have to change for different markets round the world . <EOS>
yeah yeah . <EOS> i think we are yeah . <EOS> well you had acknowledged that we have more money for this . <EOS> didn't you say so ? <EOS> yeah <EOS> well we don't have it's not that we have more money , <EOS> we can push up the the price . <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
um this leads us to some personal preferences . <EOS> uh the remote control and the docking station should uh blend in in the in the room . <EOS> um so this would mean no uh eye-catching designs . <EOS> just keep it simple <EOS> and <EOS> well <EOS> the docking station and small screen would be our main points of interest , <EOS> because this would be the these would uh be the innovativeness in the remote control . <EOS> so this would be very important that we at least include these features . <EOS>
as far as the uh whole visible light thing , we decided to go with the multiple colours coming out , <EOS> why not ? <EOS> ah . <EOS> nice . <EOS> fair enough . <EOS> of course , if that's annoying for some people that function can be turned off . um . <EOS>
ah okay . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> is there a difference ? <EOS> they're <EOS> yeah , they're <EOS> l it's a kind of lizard . <EOS> and i i like geckos <EOS> because they remind me of warm places <EOS> and , and where i was living in cambodia they used to live in my house <EOS> and they were on the ceiling <EOS> and they would make little gecko noises in the evening . <EOS>
um i hear what the marketing expert's saying about um voice activated control . <EOS> however i've got a couple of worries about that . <EOS> the power required , um and the ability to the cost , it seems like for uh an embedded system , this could cause us issues . <EOS> um for example you see that there's fairly robust services on uh computers via uh via voice , <EOS> i_b_m_ do um drag and dictate , <EOS> but these require a lot of memory <EOS> and usually um state quite advanced processor requirements . <EOS> um voice activation could be an interesting idea <EOS> but i think that our ind industrial designer would probably upon some research say that it's maybe not feasible . <EOS> um that's just my view right now , <EOS> however the idea of a joystick and then maybe an l_c_d_ which has been kind of put forward so far , <EOS> it's almost like having a small <EOS>
mm . a voice from far away <EOS> yeah . <EOS> it's a good point . if it's hidden under the couch <EOS> but then again you have this wee this wee thing you know that's just a little chip or whatever that has the page button , maybe that could be voice activated too . <EOS>
hold on , sorry . <EOS> and if you just click that it'll go ahead , one at a time . <EOS> yeah , yeah . <EOS> uh actually , sorry i have to see the other , sorry . <EOS> sorry , uh . <EOS> yeah , thank you . <EOS> uh , yes , i have to look at the uh market potential for this product , <EOS> uh , like consumer likings and everything , <EOS> what is the potential for this product <EOS> and are we able to achieve our a net profit or our aims or not ? <EOS> then <EOS>
do you think we could <EOS> i thought the pen was a little distracting for me personally , <EOS> like its heaviness , and like just being so conscious of like turning the pages , i dunno . that was a bit of a distraction . <EOS> that was the last one , like i chose not to do a powerpoint <EOS> 'cause i didn't think it made sense to , <EOS> so i liked that i had the option to do that and just to take my own notes and that whole sort of thing . <EOS>
child-friendly , i thought this was good , <EOS> as you pointed out the um <EOS> the bit , it often goes missing especially with children , <EOS> but it's a good shape <EOS> and the organic is kind of <EOS> we could make a vegetabley kind of round shape , i think . <EOS>
okay . a kind of identification , <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah f uh i know about this , since it's my it's exactly my field , so . <EOS> it's uh kind of handshaking , uh , <EOS> when starting to uh when you start to communicate with the your t_v_ then then it's like an handshaking protocol with your your remote . <EOS> so so if two two devices are trying to go to communicate with the t_v_ set then the the the one which has the more energy in the wave is chosen . <EOS> well it can be a problem sometimes , but most of the time it works okay . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> but speech recogniser can be possible . <EOS> yeah , implemented . <EOS> o okay , <EOS> we can think about that . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> and um <EOS> do you see something else ? <EOS> no . <EOS> uh , should it be equipped with the uh , with uh speakers ? <EOS>
uh . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> can't help you with that . <EOS> last . <EOS> it's no matter . <EOS> okay , <EOS> it's y <EOS> yeah . <EOS> no problem . <EOS> ah <EOS> yes . <EOS> right . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah so what we might wanna do is uh yeah cust i have customised the screen functions , if you know what i mean . <EOS> the uh younger users are more acquainted with these kind of machines so they can use more advanced functions . <EOS> but maybe elderly people don't understand it so well , so they need a simpler remote . <EOS> and yeah that you can choose what the design displays , or wha whatever . <EOS>
so , <EOS> the reason we're here , we're gonna design a new remote control , <EOS> as you probably all know . <EOS> the very broad overview is original , trendy , and user-friendly . <EOS> course , we'll have to go into a bit more um detail than that , <EOS> but uh personally i think that the original is gonna be a very key aspect to this design . <EOS> um , there's a lot of remote controls out there anyway , <EOS> so we're gonna need something that's really gonna set it apart . <EOS> this is how today seems to be going to work . <EOS> we're gonna have the three kay phases , <EOS> as you've probably already been told , <EOS> the functional , architectural , and the detailed design . um <EOS> first one's gonna be covering the user requirement spec , technical functions , working design . <EOS> second seems to be conceptual components , properties , materials , <EOS> and the last one is a detailed analysis of our design so far . <EOS> of course , you've all got the similar emails , i believe , <EOS> right . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> 'kay . <EOS> okay , <EOS> that's . <EOS> into one . <EOS> so it's not <EOS> you actually just putting three or four different remotes together but making them thinner , and um into one basically . <EOS> th that's an idea . <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
oh <EOS> yeah , . <EOS> do you agree ? <EOS> and <EOS> i <EOS> well <EOS> i think <EOS> yeah <EOS> because it's so important it's i it was written that it really so important , the um the the look and uh taking care of its it targets , the right range of people , <EOS> right ? <EOS>
excuse me . <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah , that's it . <EOS> should stay in the square here . <EOS> okay . <EOS> oh , maybe . <EOS> okay , so basically i'm gonna present some findings of a study we conducted uh into uh what users want in this remote control . <EOS> um so first of all we what we did is we um conducted a an experiment with a hundred test subjects . <EOS> um we put them in a in our um usability laboratory and got them to , you know , um play with remote controls , <EOS> and also to complete , after they'd done that , to complete a questionnaire uh to tell us what they like and what they don't like in remote controls . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> okay , <EOS> and still we have <EOS> mm can we still include the l_ l_s_d_ display ? <EOS> l_c_d_ yeah l_c_d_ . <EOS> l_c_d_ . <EOS> uh l <EOS> seems not , <EOS> it's either l_c_d_ or push-button . <EOS> so uh <EOS> it's like a <EOS>
do you not think it might need like a kind of a hard plastic inner shell with the actual delicate workings inside , and then a kind of spongy yeah , s thick spongy cover , <EOS> mm . <EOS> kind of like an internal egg . <EOS> cover . <EOS>
yeah , yeah . <EOS> there's examples of those , but they don't look as sleek as other models . <EOS> and there's no real advantage <EOS> and because it impacts on other on the materials and the price it's not great . <EOS> um <EOS> on the price , yeah . <EOS>
are the younger people going to buy the remote control or the elderly people ? <EOS> and then tho that section we're going to focus <EOS> and adjust the remote more to that section than the whole user section . <EOS> okay . <EOS> some data . <EOS> younger people , from sixteen to thir forty five um years are more interested in fj features like l_c_d_ screens , speech recognition e etcetera . <EOS> and we possess about two third of the market from in that range of age . <EOS> the elderly people , from forty five years to sixty five years are not that much interested in features , <EOS> and we possess less than two third , that's two fifth , of the market share in that area . <EOS> goed so . <EOS>
so and you want to be able to <EOS> yeah . <EOS> make this <EOS> no uh like <EOS> i would draw it like this . <EOS> . <EOS> let's say this is the side view . <EOS> that you have a a screen that will come up here , and can go down that way . <EOS> if you know what i mean . <EOS> so that it would come up like that . <EOS>
um do we have um any ideas of of maybe d <EOS> let's just throw out some ideas of what kind of remote control we want to have , <EOS> and then we can go into how we're gonna design it <EOS> and and how we're gonna do the detailing on it . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> something else ? <EOS> okay . <EOS> no . <EOS> there <EOS> this is the three concepts of our controller . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i just have one question , <EOS> because for the intelligent controller , you said that we can use the voice recognition or the gesture recognition , <EOS> but as the um expert told us , most of the people want to use the remote control to zap t to zap between channels . <EOS> do you think they will be able to use gestures ? <EOS> because , if they do all the time the same gesture , as you said previously in the last meeting , maybe they will get injuries because of that ? <EOS> or if you say channel three channel three two three four six five , i think they will be bored after a while . <EOS> you don't think so ? <EOS>
unit price . <EOS> we implemented the basic functions , <EOS> which is just t_v_ functions plus the locator , <EOS> which was one of the marketing things , <EOS> cradle , <EOS> scroll wheel for uh the the channels , <EOS> and uh we implemented the f the the way of putting the new and revolutionary zapping , your favourite channels functionality , in the scroll . <EOS>
i said uncurved or flat . <EOS> i think that's what you have there , <EOS> is that right ? <EOS> for the for the plastic part would be <EOS> my impression was that flat meant like like one of those square remotes . <EOS> but it's really not very clear , <EOS> because you got single curve and double curve and d i dunno what that means . <EOS> one side is curved and then the other side is curved . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah , well i think so too . <EOS> we <EOS> only thing that we worked through , past each other . <EOS> with some things that was only problem , <EOS> but <EOS> right . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> but that was it was our assignment , <EOS> huh ? <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> so . <EOS> are we adding one of these two features ? <EOS> gonna say <EOS> okay . <EOS> let's add one of those features and say yes . <EOS> okay . <EOS> so we're back to a one ? <EOS> or a two ? <EOS> two , 'kay . <EOS>
hmm yeah . <EOS> that's right . should be a good point . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> nothing <EOS> okay . <EOS> and how big should it be ? <EOS> n <EOS> no . yeah . <EOS> i dunno um <EOS> it shouldn't be too big , <EOS> but i don't think we can make it too small , <EOS> 'cause it has to have a lot of functions , <EOS> so . <EOS>
nothing that you really want . <EOS> true . yeah . <EOS> okay . so , <EOS> costs are within budget , <EOS> well within budget , <EOS> including a little what have we got ? <EOS> one euro left over for bits that we didn't foresee . <EOS> yes . <EOS>
oh , a dynamo is ah , it's a bicycle . it's a bicycle mechanism . <EOS> it's the en it's like if if something moves , when it moves , it stores energy . <EOS> oh okay . <EOS> yeah , the other one was the other one was a kinetic thing where you'd basically have to wind it yourself . <EOS> so i sort of picked battery . <EOS> we could have talked about doing a wind-up or a dynamo or a solar power . <EOS> um but i think solar power's not available with the rubber case anyways . <EOS>
ooh . <EOS> well , there we go . <EOS> the ipod packaging is me like was so that was like half the fun . <EOS> it's like the way it all comes all cute . <EOS> oh . <EOS> don't know . <EOS> ah hmm hmm hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm . options . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> so that's a four at most . <EOS> probably a four at most . <EOS> and lastly , <EOS> did we put the fashion in electronics ? <EOS> possibly even a five . <EOS> y yes . <EOS> more <EOS> i'd say we did . <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> fully agree . <EOS> i think you tried to use the common share folder to to to to communicate , <EOS> but um it just comes back to us so slow in the email <EOS> um it it doesn't have a , you know , a messenger will go . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> i think that's big . <EOS> w okay if you if you drop the cost , now if you make if you make go to the other side of the cost scale , and you make it less expensive , then all of a sudden now we're going into an a a new market area . <EOS> so we can say low-cost uh uh um uh good design , beautiful , wa-da-da-da-da-da . <EOS> but what i'm saying is right now we're middle market . <EOS>
yeah , <EOS> we want something easy to use <EOS> and so i think maybe something very low level wou would be enough . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . yeah , yeah . <EOS> and you think that we will be <EOS> yeah , <EOS> i think it will fit on the price we want , twel twelve euros , <EOS> so . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> alright . <EOS> but i i don't know , <EOS> i mean do you think the fact that it's going to be sold internationally will have a bearing on how we design it at all ? <EOS> yes . <EOS> think it will ? <EOS> um . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> okay , almost there . <EOS> okay . <EOS> we'll sta i'll use the powerpoint , i guess . <EOS> how was that , was that fun ? <EOS> mm . very fun . <EOS> yeah , yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> uh oh i've forgotten to mail you the minutes , <EOS> but i will do . <EOS> upsidaisy . <EOS> um um we <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
s <EOS> sweet . <EOS> even though this is coming from us as , you know , trend watch , market research , <EOS> i don't know how much of it we necessarily wanna take away . <EOS> also , considering that the d research b has been carried out by real reaction , i'm a little hesitant as to like , how these questions may have been worded , <EOS> and if necessarily this whole fashion to technology y edas ease of use is necessarily the right ranking . <EOS> personally , like i might reverse it , <EOS> but if we're working for this company then i guess no matter what , we have to stress fashion the most . <EOS> but it doesn't necessarily need to be a spongy material . <EOS>
i think maybe we should take this into account <EOS> and maybe think of some of the bigger rooms with four people , <EOS> one being temporary or or part-time . <EOS> um okay , so maybe we could try to to see now what would be the main options . <EOS> say the general uh , well , arrangement options . <EOS> do you think that we should put people , say , according to projects for instance ? <EOS> in in the table that um that we have , uh we also have the uh uh the p the main projects on which the people are working . <EOS> so how <EOS> yeah . mm-hmm . <EOS>
uh , the funtionability . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> ah okay , <EOS> so focusing more on the used buttons . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> they have to be on it <EOS> j just to t to get it done if necessary , <EOS> but um the most used buttons uh have to be bigger or <EOS>
so like one through five , or <EOS> like a radio type sorta situation ? <EOS> pre-set channels <EOS> and then we're gonna need um numbers one through zero , <EOS> right ? <EOS> uh we wouldn't even need the numbers . <EOS> no . <EOS> i think maybe numbers seems is kind of old-fashioned . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> oh yeah yeah yeah mm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> and uh well <EOS> there can be children friendly <EOS> where you can programme your remote <EOS> so that they they are not allowed uh to browse certain channels which you can block them , and you can operate them . <EOS> so these are the things presently which are seen in the market scenarios at present . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> good afternoon again . <EOS> so we should have our final meeting about the detail designed of detail design of the product of the remote control . <EOS> um so here is the agenda for today . <EOS> uh uh just going to go quickly through the minutes of the last last uh meeting <EOS> then we have a p presentation of prototype of you two , <EOS> sounds interesting . <EOS> and we'll have um presentation of evaluation crit criteria by ou our marketing experts . <EOS> then we'll have to go through finance evaluation of the of the cost of the thing <EOS> and um hopefully uh we should fit the target o tw of twelve point five uh uh euro . <EOS> okay . <EOS> so let's go . <EOS> uh if i go quickly through the minutes of the last meeting . <EOS> so we went through th uh <EOS> w we took this following decisions . <EOS> no l_c_d_ , no speech recognition technology , okay , <EOS> we went through a b to a banana look and feel for the remote control . <EOS> we went through the use of wheels and but buttons . <EOS> and also the use of a basis station for battery ch charging and uh also to um call the to call the mot mote remote control when it is lost . <EOS>
the n <EOS> yeah <EOS> but yeah most of the t_v_s have teletext nowadays . <EOS> they have t most of them have teletext , <EOS> but we want to get rid well one of our requirements is to uh to move to teletext to uh to the use of internet . <EOS> so to to uh <EOS>
uh you can do one thing . <EOS> you just select one box outsi <EOS> yeah , this box . <EOS> then move it with the help of this <EOS> okay . <EOS> just uh just uh <EOS> okay , just a minute . <EOS> it one of the buttons is sticking , i don't know . <EOS>
oh , okay . <EOS> sorry , sorry . mm-mm . <EOS> um . <EOS> okay , we had looks and voice recognition . <EOS> okay now on the financing we bring up the <EOS> mm there it is . <EOS> okay uh energy source we say that's battery , right ? <EOS>
hmm , hmm , hmm . <EOS> oh no , that's cool , <EOS> it's got <EOS> i'm kind of <EOS> i'm slightly gutted that we couldn't get plastic and rubber , <EOS> i think that would have been nice . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> it's clunky . <EOS> yeah , yeah . <EOS>
um . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> does . <EOS> okay . <EOS> so w so what was the circular thing that you were <EOS> um i think that's just for a video , <EOS> so we wouldn't need any of that at all . <EOS> so we could get it down to what ? <EOS>
it is . <EOS> been cool . <EOS> i think so <EOS> i i , you know , <EOS> and i think we've co we have come we've come up with something new , something that hasn't been done before , <EOS> we haven't we're not just rehashing an old design . <EOS>
yeah . i i hope so <EOS> those things just refer to each of each of us , i think . ami <EOS> and <EOS> okay . <EOS> yep . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i_d_ , <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so <EOS> i_d_ is for the industrial design , <EOS> yeah ? <EOS>
that's fine . <EOS> oh that's that's fine . <EOS> um so <EOS> is there anything here that you that you wanted to cover as in the criteria that you've covered ? <EOS> and then we'll come back pretty much promptly to this . <EOS> what do you mean cr is there anything i wanna <EOS>
that's kinda i <EOS> it won't be when it's been <EOS> oh <EOS> is that 'cause it's flat ? <EOS> what is what fruit or veg is flat ? <EOS> budgeted . <EOS> i i think s i i think this isn't not particularly fruit and veggie . um . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> so we are here for the concept design meeting . <EOS> so , we will first start by summarizing the mm the previous meeting and the decision we've taken . <EOS> uh i will take notes during this meeting so uh that you can uh look at my uh folder to see the summary of this meeting afterwards . <EOS> so each of you will uh show us the various investigation they've done during uh previous uh hours . <EOS> we'll then t take decision in concert <EOS> and then uh uh we will uh define the nest next task , to have to be done before the next meeting . <EOS> so , last time we decided to have a simple interface . <EOS> we also decided to have a wheel to change channel previous channel button . <EOS> channel digit uh buttons should be uh protected by plastic cover or something for the remote control to look very simple . <EOS> we have also button for volume , and to switch on off the t_v_ . <EOS> we have also uh the lightening feature for the remote control to be easy to find , <EOS> and for fast development and low cost we have decided to have no l_c_d_ no voice features . <EOS>
uh . yeah . that's . okay . <EOS> okay <EOS> i've got a presentation about the working design . <EOS> um first about how it works . <EOS> it's really simple of course . <EOS> everybody knows how a remote works . <EOS> the user presses a button . <EOS> the remote determines what button it is , <EOS> uses the infrared to send a signal to the t_v_ . <EOS> the t_v_ switches to the frequency , or what function it is . <EOS> so <EOS> we've got um the the plate . <EOS> it gots conductive disks for every button . <EOS> when the user presses a button , a signal got sent , <EOS> goes to the led <EOS> and transmits tranmi transmits its to the t_v_ . <EOS> it's a very simple device , technically speaking . <EOS> so <EOS> this is a schematic overview . <EOS> you've got the buttons . <EOS> the power source . <EOS> and uh when a button gets pressed , its goes to the chip . <EOS> the chip uh controls the infrared bulb and perf perhaps a normal bulb . <EOS> when you press a button you can actually see your pressed button . <EOS> well um <EOS> i think we should use default materials , simple plastics . <EOS> keep the inner workings simple , <EOS> so it's robust . <EOS> uh i think we should focus on aesthetics , the design and the user interface , <EOS> because if you're going to use high-tech materials the price is going to go sky-high . <EOS> and uh you only have to design a remote once , <EOS> and if you use high-tech materials it come back in every product . <EOS> so <EOS> it's , in my idea , it's uh it's gonna be smart to invest in di in design and not in uh in the product itself . <EOS>
memory in the in the remote . <EOS> yep . <EOS> profiles . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> the memory uh pops up the options . <EOS> yeah . yeah , that would be possible . yeah , sure . <EOS> okay . <EOS> i th don't think that's uh that takes a lot of storage space or some just varia variables . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yep . <EOS> just i'm <EOS> i really want to talk to it . <EOS> but . <EOS> so <EOS> but but continue with your uh <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah actually , yeah . <EOS> it won't talk back . <EOS> uh so well <EOS> then the this is the a more a little uh smooth <EOS> and it gives a lot of functionality , uh in this way , <EOS> so all we have <EOS> uh th you see there are only six keys , <EOS> but don't worry <EOS> they are ma they are doing the job of twelve keys actually here . <EOS>
yep . <EOS> so are there any um improvements or issues or <EOS> it won't stand . <EOS> oh there are issues , oh there are issues . <EOS> just let it lie down , <EOS> it wont stand . <EOS> um main problem that we have unfortunately being finance . <EOS>
i think it does . <EOS> i if you don't make it green , then the elder people won't won't like it . <EOS> i think so . <EOS> it's pretty fancy . <EOS> i think <EOS> yeah , i have to agree , <EOS> all the colour colours don don doesn't matter that m that much now , <EOS> it's only design . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> some spots . <EOS> ah some eye . <EOS> yeah <EOS> it's l looks very friendly . <EOS> yeah that's a fr friendly turtle i guess . <EOS> yeah well <EOS> i think it's uh fair enough . <EOS> yeah okay . <EOS> a little tail maybe . <EOS>
we could focus on the biggest market . <EOS> mm . <EOS> ge uh <EOS> if say people between age group of twenty to thirty five are the biggest market ? <EOS> and when we've been throwing up our ideas we're automatically talking about business people , young people , trendy people . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> so you can add seven plus six plus seven plus <EOS> no , wait . <EOS> what do you say seven ? <EOS> five ? <EOS> yeah uh five . <EOS> five . <EOS> five , <EOS> maybe maybe maybe six <EOS> it's it's i guess it's <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
yeah , sure . <EOS> i <EOS> that's true . <EOS> oh yeah , that's a good that's a good point , so . <EOS> one and <EOS> yeah , <EOS> but suppose you got a cold . you have a mute remote controller . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm . <EOS>
is it plugged in all the way <EOS> and you screwed it in <EOS> and <EOS> ah , wait , <EOS> 's screw in . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i i think you just have to push it in really hard . <EOS> push the screw . <EOS> that's it . <EOS>
it's slow . <EOS> you were slow too <EOS> so <EOS> 'cause it's so <EOS> 'cause it's green . <EOS> dude you're a good drawer . <EOS> uh some other line uh width uh <EOS> do you have a turtle pet ? <EOS> no . <EOS> uh okay . <EOS> i dunno . <EOS> does it have legs ? <EOS> yeah ? <EOS>
um any questions , before we get started ? <EOS> i assume that we're building a stand alone uh remote control , <EOS> we can't kind of build it into other uh products . <EOS> you mean to like <EOS> for instance like a mobile phone or something like that . <EOS>
. <EOS> into the <EOS> more compact and uh okay , . <EOS> mm . mm . <EOS> yeah , yeah . okay . <EOS> mm . you can put it on the charger when uh you when you don't need to use it . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> it's a good idea . <EOS>
why this strange factor of seven ? <EOS> because i <EOS> i'm sorry . sorry . <EOS> usually i have seen that scales are from one to ten . <EOS> ah yeah . <EOS> it's from <EOS> sorry , <EOS> it's from one to seven . it's from from one to seven <EOS> sorry . <EOS> because it should be an even it should be an even uh scale , <EOS> and five <EOS>
yes . <EOS> mm . <EOS> okay . okay . <EOS> mm-hmm yep . <EOS> voila . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> so <EOS> anyone uh has a point to bring in <EOS> or shall we <EOS> no . <EOS> so . <EOS> well . <EOS> oh <EOS> i don't have anything right now . <EOS> we can we'll we'll go <EOS> and we'll i'm sure we'll up something good <EOS> for the <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> eighty percent of users would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy . <EOS> um . current remote controls do not match well the operating behaviour of the user . <EOS> uh seventy five percent of users said they zap a lot , <EOS> so they use their remote control quite frequently while they're watching television . <EOS> uh . fifty percent of users say that they only use ten percent of the buttons , <EOS> so they've got a remote control with a lot of functionality <EOS> but really most of the time they only use a small part of that . <EOS>
sorry . <EOS> mm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah so <EOS> of course <EOS> for example uh i wanted to know like if you want to have a a fo if you want to have the l_c_d_ display over there , <EOS> or if you want to store a programmes with a keys <EOS>
uh <EOS> oh , it's just participant one oh okay . yeah . <EOS> can you all d e-mail me your e-mail addresses ? <EOS> well it's just w it's just <EOS> it's just par participant one , participant two . <EOS> you have them i you have them , <EOS> but we'll send you an e-mail . <EOS> you want to have friends , don't you ? <EOS>
well . <EOS> mm . <EOS> well , i think again it's it we have a cost issue here . <EOS> you know if we're gonna go in this direction , to me we're going to the other side of the cost range . <EOS> are we gonna make this selling selling the cost as a high high-tech uh um environmentally sensitive whatever , or are we gonna go to the lower side of the range ? <EOS> again i don't see our market niche in the middle for our product yet . <EOS> i don't see it yet . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah ? <EOS> 'kay . <EOS> yes . 'kay . <EOS> i think you can put uh the laptop back in the room and <EOS> this is <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yes sir . <EOS> time pressure . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so <EOS> i guess what i'd like from a universal remote is maybe choosing between three devices , being able to switch between them , there may be stereo , v_c_r_ and t_v_ . <EOS> actu <EOS> yes . yeah . <EOS>
oh okay . right . <EOS> and or sixty six enter , y <EOS> and then like twelve , enter . <EOS> alright , aye . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah i think that's probably more straightforward . <EOS> yeah . good <EOS> yeah . <EOS> um , okay so we can <EOS> we'll say yes it's uh one ? <EOS> okay . <EOS>
let me just add one more thing that i couldn't say before , <EOS> and that's just that there's the new technology that they've developed on the voice recognition . <EOS> sure . <EOS> um . <EOS> oh this the thing we were talking about earlier . <EOS> right <EOS> except that it's sort of odd , <EOS> and i'm no not exactly sure why they are explaining it in the way they are , <EOS> um there's a sample sensor and there's a sample speaker unit for <EOS> so , you would say like , good morning , coffeemaker , and it would respond , good morning , jill , <EOS> but <EOS>
that's better . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . yes . mm . <EOS> so draw it . <EOS> we will try to guess what it is . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> i'm a very bad drawer . <EOS> weird . <EOS> um . you're not gonna be able to guess from my drawing . <EOS> i'm a bad drawer . <EOS> okay . <EOS>
oh that's fine . <EOS> 'kay . uh i didn't get a chance to complete this one , 'cause some of the tools that i was given were frustrating . <EOS> uh okay , so method method of our design , i think i just start listing th some of the things that we actually need to put into this . <EOS> we need a power source , we're gonna need a smart chip if we're gonna make it multi-functional . <EOS> um extra functions will probably need an additional chip . <EOS> either that or the smart chip will have to be extremely smart . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> you know , or you can just kind of scroll through the options u that come up on the t_v_ . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> well for sure we need the um <EOS> i think we can just design the channels ? <EOS> i mean power's just a button , and it's not used that much , <EOS> s and it's usually that red <EOS> and i think it's quite nice to keep it like red . <EOS>
oh . <EOS> uh-huh . <EOS> and uh a spongy material to be used on the on the outside . <EOS> mm <EOS> i hadn't thought of that , <EOS> that's different , certainly . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> but uh i was gonna say <EOS> um yeah , <EOS> fruit and vegetables , uh important to this year um important to furniture , <EOS> i'm just gonna say <EOS>
yep . <EOS> thank you very much indeed , <EOS> i think that i think that's uh <EOS> i think we can go f for an early bath . <EOS> so i call the meeting closed . <EOS> cool , thank you , <EOS> alright . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS>
