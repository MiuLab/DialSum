yeah . <EOS> so there should <EOS> we should think of something like that <EOS> and then it should be double curve . <EOS> the s science for the ease of handling and there are some other issues why we need double curve . <EOS> then controls <EOS> for the traditionals u traditional users we can have the push buttons so that they don't feel that it's an alien thing for them . <EOS>
yep . <EOS> soon as i get this . <EOS> okay . <EOS> this is our last meeting . <EOS> um i'll go ahead and go through the minutes from the previous meeting . <EOS> uh and then we'll have a , the prototype presentation . <EOS> um then we will um do an evaluation . <EOS> uh or we'll see what , what we need to have under the criteria for the evaluation . <EOS> then we'll go through the finance and see if we fall within the budget . <EOS> um then we'll do the evaluation , <EOS> and then we can finish up after that with um any changes that we'll need to make , <EOS> or hopefully everything will fall right in line . <EOS> um let's see , <EOS> minutes from the last meeting . <EOS> um we looked at uh the the trends . <EOS> we had uh the fashion trends that people want a fancy look-and-feel . <EOS> it was twice as important as anything else . <EOS> um they liked fruit and vegetables in the new styles . <EOS> um and a spongy feel . <EOS> so we were talking about trying to incorporate those into our prototype . <EOS> um they wanted limited buttons and simplicity . <EOS> um then we looked at the uh the method for coming up with our own remote . <EOS> um looking at other other devices . <EOS> um the ipod , we really liked the look of that . <EOS> um we also had uh the kid's remote for a simple idea . <EOS> um a two part remote , which was what were were originally looking at . <EOS> uh and then um there was talk of spee uh speech recognition um becoming more uh predominant and easier to use . <EOS> but i think we've still decided not to go with that . <EOS> then we looked at the components um <EOS> the materials for the case , the different energy sources , the different types of chips , <EOS> um and made a decision on what we were going to use to make our remote . <EOS> um and basically how , <EOS> what were making for the prototype . <EOS> so i'm going to leave it at that <EOS> and let you guys take over . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> excellent . <EOS> 'cause like if you look at the train , it's just very like , there's no extra bits on it , <EOS> the train on the website <EOS> and i dunno if you can put it up on the thing <EOS> um but it is just like a long like thing used for mu moving people , <EOS> but it looks really pretty too . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> well . <EOS> this is a <EOS> single curve ? <EOS> mm . <EOS> i guess it's double curved . <EOS> double curved ? <EOS> one of those ? <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> case materi s supplements . <EOS> plastic we said , <EOS> right ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> and ther there should be a beep if many buttons are pressed <EOS> if suppose a child is playing with the remote controller and a and she she or he is pressing the buttons all at the time then there should be a beep saying that it's this this is not a a you know a a action , there can be no action taking to that so . <EOS> and there should be a child lock , <EOS> like uh uh you should be able to lock your remote controller so that uh um whatever buttons are pressed by a child they can't be like y you i you if you have ki kids and all then they'll be pl playing with the remote controllers so can lock the remote controller . <EOS> if make it useable for more than one device it's a it's hard but i think it's possible <EOS> but it uh <EOS> yeah yeah yeah <EOS> so it's it's okay , yeah , yeah . <EOS> and uh different shapes that we can do <EOS> like uh we can have you know a all animals shapes or you know comfortable uh whi which can fit into your hands <EOS> and um so that uh <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . yeah . <EOS> otherwise , if it's different then of course everybody has somebody has to learn to use it first . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> but also we we see that that most people find it find remote controls too complex because they have too many buttons and they mainly use only channels and volume buttons . <EOS> so we may just uh make a very easy to use remote control with mainly those buttons <EOS> and maybe also um <EOS>
yes , just lemon . <EOS> yeah , just a lemon t_v_ it'd be yellow lemon . <EOS> yeah , but y you know the traditional t_v_ it's um <EOS> it's flat , uh <EOS> yeah yeah it's flat , <EOS> yeah the shape is very boring . <EOS> could we come up with new t_v_ with such as this kind of t_v_ ? <EOS> so you can you have base , triangle base so you the t_v_ you can <EOS>
transmit . <EOS> uh so this is <EOS> these are the circuits un underneath the buttons . <EOS> uh can you see the black uh , round marks ? <EOS> they they are the circuits . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yes . <EOS> next , please . <EOS> and um like uh we have uh designed uh before we have seen some uh few things like instead off buttons we have some scrolls . <EOS> uh b but a b a push-button requires a simple chip underneath it , but whereas a scroll wheel requires normally a regular chip which is a higher price range . <EOS> like for s scrolls we have to go for a sophisticated and and k uh uh uh full a complete chip . <EOS> uh and a as energy source we offer a basic battery , a more ingenious uh hard dynamo , um a kinetic provision of energy , <EOS> more than what is that you shake casually to provide energy . so that also we can have in a battery , <EOS> uh or we can use solar sells . <EOS> uh . <EOS>
so i reckon <EOS> how about with embossing the logo , isn't that going to cost us some money ? <EOS> doesn't say so . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> that's a freebie . <EOS> reckon that probably counts as a special form for the buttons . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah that's a good idea . <EOS> just one ? <EOS> does that mean that one button has a special form or <EOS>
mm . <EOS> um i would guess this comes back from this whole b_ thing links in here , <EOS> so possibly for left-handed . investigate . <EOS> yep . <EOS> but otherwise it's superb . <EOS> so , should we give it a six ? <EOS> six ? <EOS> six . <EOS>
yeah , uh teletext . <EOS> think so . <EOS> okay . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> so <EOS> you don't want to bother people with uh loads of buttons , <EOS> but on the other hand they need many buttons <EOS> so they don't have to get out of their seat . <EOS>
we also made some uh ideas about how uh the options menu would work . <EOS> uh using the scroll button on sides uh y uh i uh um <EOS> you push the scroll button <EOS> and it's claps out <EOS> if there's a <EOS> yeah , you push the scroll button <EOS> and a drop down menu or a pull out menu comes out <EOS> and uh you get uh you get the options uh becoming available . for example uh t_v_ settings , uh remote settings , et cetera . <EOS> so uh you can scroll down too with the scroll uh button , <EOS> uh as you can see <EOS> oh , <EOS> it's here , <EOS> just push it in , <EOS> uh the menu comes out like this <EOS> and uh i it all becomes visible . um <EOS>
change the channels . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> uh the <EOS> i think that a scroll wheel is actually pretty a pretty handy way of of changing the channel . <EOS> 'cause i know when i um when i use the remote to change the channel i very rarely use the numbers on the on the pad . <EOS> i usually use the up and down <EOS> because most channels are you know two digit numbers and you have to press you know a special button to enter a two-digit number , and then two numbers , <EOS> so that's just uh it's annoying . <EOS> so i think a scroll wheel is is quite handy . <EOS>
agnes , yes . <EOS> yes <EOS> and uh evaluation criteria . <EOS> the finance , it's uh from my side , from the management , <EOS> and uh production evaluation . then uh closing . <EOS> so we have forty minutes to discuss and uh finalise and close the product and project and to move further , okay , <EOS> so <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah , so they can sit there and go like <EOS> not that watching t_v_ should be that stressful . <EOS> and you know , yeah , you can fuzz it across the room and throw it at throw it at your children yeah . <EOS> oh yeah , i guess t_v_ can be stressful , yeah , if you're watching sports . <EOS>
as you can see that my artist artistic work is useless as well . <EOS> anyway um . <EOS> and uh one of the best uh things about fish is that they don't really take uh too much looking after <EOS> because uh with most of the animals if you're going away on holiday or whatever , you've gotta spend money or get a friend or whatever to look after them for you . <EOS> whereas if you got fish , you just gotta put the food in a a a dripper feed which feeds them over the uh couple of weeks that you're away <EOS>
this should be uh accommodated with some software , <EOS> uh , uh . yeah . <EOS> yeah , that's right . yeah . <EOS> right . <EOS> swahili . swahili . <EOS> yeah <EOS> you can use icons <EOS> for the <EOS> yeah . <EOS> ja , well possible . <EOS>
yeah , <EOS> we can <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> that's that's the advantage of intelligent controller . <EOS> even you h you have the controller , i can i can say channel three , <EOS> so it's c come to channel three , <EOS> i don't have to <EOS>
and <EOS> and one more feature is we we have a holder for this remote which is an oyster shape . <EOS> a shell shape . <EOS> mm , 'kay , mm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> for the snail , yeah , mm-hmm , <EOS> we have the snail shell . <EOS> he goes right back into his shell . <EOS> well you know i think we could do something really funny with this too <EOS> because the snail is known to be slow <EOS> and we could have some sort of little comic effect on our marketing about how this is a rapid snail or something like that <EOS> you know that would , that would really work . <EOS> so <EOS>
nor i . <EOS> i mean <EOS> it's just like the paper i don't know what i really needed the paper for . <EOS> um , because i've got this laptop . standard , <EOS> i just used it <EOS> 'cause it's literally right in front of me . <EOS> true . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
yeah , unnecessary . yeah . <EOS> um yeah we're getting a lot of features now , <EOS> i i think <EOS> yeah . <EOS> well , i think a consideration too is that these uh remotes get abused a lot , <EOS> you know they get thrown around , <EOS> there's a good chance the the t_f_t_ screen would break or uh get damaged . <EOS> they're pretty fragile . <EOS>
yeah . yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah , i was thinking that as well , <EOS> i think the the only ones that i've seen that you buy are the sort of one for all type things <EOS> where they're , <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so presumably that might be an idea to put into . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> so we don't have to worry about that . <EOS> um but we do have to use the <EOS> the company wants us to incorporate the corporate colour and our slogan , <EOS> which is we put the fashion in electronics . <EOS> and our corporate colours are grey and yellow . <EOS> and we could probably get away with black too but <EOS> so those are the three um the three new requirements <EOS> that that i was told we need to use . <EOS>
is that just switches on the speech recognition and it's entirely speech operated , is it ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> right . <EOS> so i think i i missed the budget thing , <EOS> it was fifty million euros ? <EOS> and we gotta sell twenty five of them ? <EOS> right . okay . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> but <EOS> you shake it and scream at it . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> but but do you think that it will be a good idea to use dynamo , tha these type of cells ? <EOS> because then people have to , well like if the cell is out of bat <EOS> yeah , to <EOS> mo yeah . <EOS>
and play-doh . <EOS> uh-huh . <EOS> yeah , yeah , the play-doh was best , i thought . <EOS> yeah well , <EOS> 'cause i mean it's so hard to describe what you mean just with words and pointing at photographs and saying , well we quite want this , but imagine it rounder . <EOS> so much better just to go and , you know , this is it , this is what we want . <EOS>
that's pinocchio . <EOS> how do you draw a dog ? <EOS> i suppose it has a lon <EOS> oh my god . <EOS> right . <EOS> yous know what it's supposed to be . <EOS> it's a dog . <EOS> . um , i like dogs because , um , they're so good to humans , <EOS> like they can be trained to be police dogs and seeing-eye dogs , <EOS> and they're just such friendly animals . <EOS> and , like they're more of a companion than cats . <EOS> i've nothing against cats . <EOS> cats don't really like me , so i can't like them . <EOS> but they're just so friendly and warm and nice animals , <EOS> that don't look like that . <EOS>
the chunk . <EOS> so <EOS> that's maybe not something we have to decide just right now , <EOS> is it . <EOS> just somewhere a long the scale of in between these two . <EOS> no , <EOS> but i mean in terms <EOS> we have to evaluate one of them . <EOS> unless do you guys wanna evaluate both ? <EOS>
yeah . um <EOS> well , but it's it's just an a approximation . <EOS> dual use , perfect . <EOS> dual use , perfect . <EOS> does it vibrate when you press the buttons ? <EOS> sorry , sorry . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> oh , <EOS> your remote control <EOS> ? oh that's just bad . <EOS>
yeah there's a thingy and a dingy and <EOS> you press this and it does th <EOS> yeah y do jabber . well <EOS> so you've got here's here's a transistor , and this amplifies your signal , <EOS> um you've got the l_e_d_ here on the end of the uh uh on the end of the printed circuit board . <EOS> um you've got a couple diodes here for i don't know who and whatnot . <EOS>
yes yes . <EOS> i think <EOS> i i thin i think it will not take lots of place , we just need a microphone and the software , <EOS> so , and it sh and it will be a little bit new and interesting , <EOS> so people may be attracted to buy this stuff <EOS> and it's not very difficult to uh put a software inside the the electronic device and put a microphone . <EOS> it doesn't take that much place and also that much it doesn't cost that much . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> how would we go about um making you know getting rid of our weak points ? <EOS> what <EOS> i mean would we just have a flat spot on the bottom of the ball ? <EOS> not to put you on the spot , <EOS> but <EOS> e <EOS> no no , <EOS> uh uh . <EOS>
not just a p_ . <EOS> p_ <EOS> yeah , just a p_ . <EOS> .. . <EOS> um . <EOS> where's where's the button for two ? <EOS> i forgot that one . <EOS> i thought i forgot something , <EOS> but uh . <EOS> and uh and uh the numbers , <EOS> that should be a bit larger <EOS> i think it's not really on scale and and so forth . <EOS> um an options button . <EOS> and i thought the the button for teletext apar uh apart <EOS> because it's not really options , i think . <EOS> it's uh options is the settings of the remote and of the t_v_ and that kind of uh thing . <EOS> so could call it settings or something . <EOS> but this is a bit uh how i thought it . <EOS> and uh the l_c_d_ uh somewhere on the remote . <EOS> perhaps we could be more curvy the remote perhaps should , <EOS>
okay . yeah . yeah . that's right . <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay , uh <EOS> now my personal preferences . <EOS> uh using the standards , basic <EOS> um i think that we should stand out uh unique , being unique with the design . <EOS> so we have to , i dunno , uh make a different shape than usual . <EOS> so when you are in the shop and you see our t_v_ controller hanging , that it stands out . <EOS> not just in in the row when you see all the same uh remote controls . <EOS>
mm . mm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> some kind of a ring , <EOS> some <EOS> keys and things like that , <EOS> yeah . <EOS> whistle and it screams at you , yeah . <EOS> yeah , that's it , you know . <EOS> i know , it's weird . <EOS> my flatmate and i were talking about this on the way into uni this morning <EOS> and i was like i need to get one for everything . <EOS> so yeah , so maybe something where you clap and then it beeps , <EOS> something <EOS> a kind of sound that you don't often hear on the t_v_ , you know , <EOS> 'cause you don't want your remote control beeping every five minutes , <EOS> 'cause you you'd then deliberately lose it by throwing it out the window or something . <EOS> so okay ? <EOS> cool . <EOS> that's me . <EOS>
the t_v_ yeah . <EOS> the s the turbo button . <EOS> so rather than having uh an extra button for um for the on off switch you just use the turbo button . <EOS> which one ? <EOS> the turbo button . <EOS> okay . <EOS> additional button . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> forgot . <EOS> uh well , <EOS> this is the total interface uh that f of the l_c_d_ screen . <EOS> uh the numbers , which is pretty straight forward . <EOS> we put ano an an extra button in . <EOS> we can erase it , <EOS> but it's the button where you can switch channels . <EOS> just when you are one and you go to two , you can or if you go to five , you can go back to one with that button . <EOS> yeah , that one , yeah . <EOS> it has a name . <EOS> and uh uh we put that in , <EOS> i thought it would be handy there . <EOS> uh this the one number or two numbers button . <EOS> below that , the page and the sound . <EOS> and uh in the middle the the mute . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yes . <EOS> okay . <EOS> so <EOS> i just want to give you uh mike again , the first uh presentation <EOS> of your <EOS> shall i start ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> no . <EOS> okay well <EOS> i received an email <EOS> okay . <EOS> i searched the web , <EOS> uh and uh i searched uh on this d document , recent investigation of the remote control market . <EOS> it has been done in italy uh italy and in uh another country in europe , <EOS> i forget it . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> it depends where you put your screen , <EOS> because the screen is uh seven inch , so it depends on you where where you put it . <EOS> it doesn't matter . <EOS> um it's just one cord from from the main board to the screen which can be elsewhere . <EOS> so this will be t_f_t_ . <EOS> and on the main board we have the um interface to the microphone , which is somewhere , <EOS>
mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so what we re really need to decide is whether we want the actual banana shape or just a a purely blob or some sort of abstraction in between the two <EOS> that isn't <EOS> that is more curved , like a banana , <EOS> but that isn't actually recognisable as a banana , you know , with the grooves and the stalk and stuff , <EOS> so . <EOS>
need to unplug this ? <EOS> need it back . <EOS> there you go . <EOS> right so <EOS> i think we've covered most of these important questions through this um through you guys's presentations <EOS> um we've got uh y the industrial designer suggests uh or pretty much emphatically suggested that we need to go with plastic . <EOS> um sarah , she's recommended that we go for simpler functions , so fewer functions <EOS> um but we need to decide who are we selling this to , <EOS> you s your stats suggested that seventy five percent of people under thirty five wanted , thought about voice control , <EOS> um so do we wanna go for that , <EOS> or do we want to go for an older demographic , <EOS> and my thought is um we've got w <EOS> if we're gonna go for a sleek look i mean we are putting the fashion in electronics um . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> the the the new uh new modern uh remote controls , uh the buttons are part of the uh the style , i think is part of the remote control itself . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> it it's one uh a one uh out of one shape . <EOS> uh it's n doesn't is uh a button uh um <EOS> how do you say it ? <EOS> it it didn't it i <EOS> it don't come out of the on the background . <EOS> it is in uh the c a remote control uh <EOS>
i know . <EOS> okay . nope . <EOS> there we go . <EOS> here you are . <EOS> jess . <EOS> g oh , geez . <EOS> alright , so <EOS> i'm gonna describe the the concept of the user interface of this des device . <EOS> um we've talked about uh the two essential properties of the user interface . <EOS> we want it to be simple <EOS> and we want it to be fashionable . <EOS> um <EOS> other <EOS> we've also got to remember that this is a device that serves as a useful purpose . <EOS> uh we want people to be able to use it s as a remote control , <EOS> so we need to determine what the essential functions of the d of the device are <EOS> and make sure that we include that we've included all of those <EOS> and that we actually end up with a device that is going to be useful to people . <EOS> we have a number of different choices for a design concept um <EOS> and s that's that's something that that i'll show you some examples of <EOS> um , but essentially we need to choose how how is this device going to work , <EOS> how how <EOS> what kind of model is there going to be for user interaction with this device . <EOS> uh once we've chosen a a concept for it , we can then design the features around the concept , <EOS> making sure that we get all the essential functions in the device and uh the extra functions and the more advanced features . <EOS> and of course we also have to make it look cool . <EOS>
yeah yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> spongy also . <EOS> so if we try to push the buttons , it <EOS> you think it's possible ? <EOS> oh no i think it's possible . <EOS> but <EOS> no the button would be <EOS> in fact it it should be something odd shaped , with a spongy cover . <EOS>
right . <EOS> i i can <EOS> right . <EOS> people don't buy a new remote every so often . <EOS> i can address some of that issue , i think , with uh my presentation . <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay . awesome . <EOS> um so design preferences , <EOS> um we need easy to read like large buttons , clearly labelled <EOS> so that , i mean 'cause we talked about that being a problem . <EOS> um and then also buttons illuminating upon touch , <EOS> you said that in your design , <EOS> with the bulb . <EOS> um and that could also tie in with the colour scheme . <EOS> uh we need the real reaction logo and colour scheme obviously . <EOS> that's one of our key goals , we wanna promote our product . <EOS>
so <EOS> we can start ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> suppose i have to do my presentation . eh um <EOS> ah okay . <EOS> it's ada longmund ? <EOS> so , <EOS> i'll present myself , <EOS> i'm ada longmund , <EOS> and as you may know it , i'm the pr project manager . <EOS> so um <EOS> we will have to um speak about m the project . <EOS> our project project is to create um a new remote control <EOS> and as you may know there's lot of industrials interesting in creating a remote control , <EOS> so the remote control has to be original , trendy and um user-friendly . <EOS> record . <EOS> so <EOS> the project method is the following . <EOS> so <EOS> if we're um the functional design , you have to do uh any individual work <EOS> and uh also work with uh meetings talking with each other . <EOS> uh it will be the same for the conceptual design and also the same for the detailed design . uh . <EOS>
yeah , yeah . <EOS> it's just making use of the same space and the same materials , but <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> okay . <EOS> um and the case , it's more of a single-curved case , <EOS> i guess would be that be the general <EOS> yeah , <EOS> one big curve i guess you could say . <EOS>
we're good ? <EOS> oh , <EOS> i think mine's fallen off . <EOS> it fell <EOS> that's why . <EOS> i guess it's gonna be hard to drink coffee . <EOS> mm . <EOS> uh okay . <EOS> ah . <EOS> okay ? <EOS> right , so <EOS> i'm just gonna start this powerpoint real quick . <EOS> yeah , powerpoint . <EOS> yeah , well , <EOS> you know , . <EOS>
um so i will be uh sebastian the project manager . <EOS> um you are the <EOS> i'm uh michael . i'm the user interface designer . <EOS> okay . <EOS> hi i'm guillermo . i'm the marketing expert . <EOS> and i am hemant , the industrial designer . <EOS>
and the pen's dying . <EOS> um . <EOS> a horse . <EOS> uh . <EOS> horse . <EOS> um i don't really know how the legs go , <EOS> but anyway i will do that . <EOS> that's very good . <EOS> um , and the main reason is they're pretty . <EOS> i think they're very pretty and they go well with the environment , <EOS> and i like the way they run <EOS> and i used to do horse riding and they're just very sort of sturdy and nice animals . <EOS> and i like the way um they feel , sort of under under the hand , <EOS> i think that's pretty much it . <EOS> um <EOS>
it's it's quite innovative , yes . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> um . <EOS> and if you watch t_v_ outside it's very useful . <EOS> so i think before talking about the other thing , it's important thing it's the case . <EOS> uh what what are gonna be the size , <EOS> because its weight drives the other what we are going to use as features and so on . <EOS> for example for the for the l_c_d_ , if we choose to have a small device , we cannot use this um a such a a a screen . <EOS>
right . <EOS> it needs , yeah . <EOS> yeah that shouldn't be a problem . <EOS> um for example the plastic they have on your laptop there is something that's perfectly possible for us to do . <EOS> um if next we can have the um user interface developer go ahead and make a brief presentation that'd be great as well .
yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> i'm concerned , <EOS> when you read the the r_s_i_ issue again , repetitive strain injury , i don't think just moving your finger around on a small screen is going to deal with that enough , <EOS> i think that is still a kind of a question mark issue how we deal with that . <EOS> um , r_s_i_ tends to be caused by repetitive small movements . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> are we ready for our last presentation , amber ? <EOS> yeah , <EOS> i'm just trying to move it . <EOS> okay . <EOS> 'kay . i think it should be there , working design . <EOS> working design . <EOS> there we go . <EOS> 'kay . <EOS> oh my bad . <EOS>
maybe , not <EOS> i don't know where where you have to put it . <EOS> yeah well , <EOS> that's that's i think that's the layers that produce . <EOS> now i have to figure out what's uh what to put on . what we're gonna use . <EOS> and later we can d uh do the design . <EOS>
you know . <EOS> colours . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> cutest . <EOS> cutest remote control on the block . <EOS> so i think we have to play with the image , <EOS> play with the snail image <EOS> um play with the visual <EOS> and then the voice recognition . <EOS> i think those are the two things to push . <EOS> the look <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . i dunno . <EOS> but if we if we need <EOS> yeah . <EOS> and if we wanna incorporate the fruit thing somehow , <EOS> there might be <EOS> i mean if it if it in if it uh conflicts with the comfort of actually holdi holding the <EOS>
depends . <EOS> when you when you use a remote , do you press the buttons with your thumb , usually ? <EOS> harder to push . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> or your fingers ? <EOS> um <EOS> i usually hold it in one hand . <EOS> maybe <EOS> or maybe you want something that's shaped like a mobile phone , <EOS> so you you hold it in one hand , <EOS> and you press the buttons with your thumb . <EOS>
just to to make it more obvious what we have to fit in there , and that we do have to fit the stuff in there . <EOS> i've more information on possible materials um as well . <EOS> what we can and cannot do . <EOS> um but let's just wait for this to load up <EOS> and i'll show you what we're talking about here . <EOS> okay . <EOS>
ami . <EOS> ami should for <EOS> okay , fine . save . <EOS> okay good , so that's the good news . <EOS> we gonna be popular . <EOS> um . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so that uh <EOS> i think financing was pretty simple . <EOS>
yellow and grey . <EOS> mm grapefruit . <EOS> grapefruit . <EOS> grapefruit <EOS> is what we'd go for , when it comes to the outer appearance perhaps . <EOS> but mm . <EOS> i would say , if i were to make a decision , i would probably put the fruit aspect at the lower lower end of the spectrum of of importance . <EOS>
sure . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay . great . <EOS> okay . <EOS> um well , <EOS> the function of a remote control , as what uh we've been informed , is basically to send messages to the television set , <EOS> for example , switch it on , switch it off , go to this channel , go to channel nine , turn the volume up , etcetera . <EOS> um some of the considerations is just um for example the what it needs to include <EOS> it's the numbers , you know , zero to nine , so you can move to a channel , the power button on slash off , <EOS> the channel going up and down , <EOS> volume going up and down , and then mute , a mute function . <EOS> and then functions for v_h_s_ , d_v_d_ , <EOS> for example , play , rewind , fast-forward , stop , pause , enter . <EOS> and enter would be for like , you know , the menus . <EOS> and then other menus for d_v_ as well as t_v_ , <EOS> whether that means like um we can go and decide the brightness of the screen , things like that , all the more complicated functions of menus . <EOS>
and for the marketing uh manager , i dunno , okay , which is bob , uh you are going to try to to find the user requirements f uh for the remote control . <EOS> um , you will receive by email uh the specific instructions and uh by your personal coach . <EOS>
yeah . yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> uh one . <EOS> three point one . <EOS> i have four . <EOS> three . <EOS> one , four , three , three , <EOS> three point two ? <EOS> three . <EOS> three . <EOS> uh . one . <EOS> three point three . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> ten perc <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> ju um just as an idea on the uh speech recognition thing that pr it'd probably be quite expensive to incorporate an entire speech recognition thing <EOS> and they're not that great anyway . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> just remove them completely ? <EOS> that might be the <EOS> i wonder whether we could get the remote control with no buttons at all if we went for voice recognition , <EOS> given that um the <EOS> um now <EOS> the the age structure we were looking at <EOS> um i mean w we had usage by age structure , <EOS> what we didn't have was what proportion of people using remotes were in those particular age groups . <EOS> now <EOS> do we know whether they <EOS>
but it's just a speaker right ? <EOS> it's <EOS> no , <EOS> what it is , it's it's very <EOS> it's not a microphone . <EOS> it has a has a microphone , <EOS> has a speaker , it's got a little chip <EOS> and it allows you t <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . okay . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> right . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> 'kay , okay . like that . <EOS> okay . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm okay , great . <EOS> okay , right . <EOS> um , okay well <EOS> i gotta kind of got five minutes to wrap up now . <EOS> um next thing we're doing is having lunch . <EOS> whoohoo . <EOS> um and then we're gonna have thirty minutes of working on the next stage . <EOS> um so i'll be putting the minutes of this uh this meeting into the project documents folder . <EOS> um so uh i guess just to just to confirm that we know what we're doing in the next well in the thirty minutes after lunch anyway , <EOS> um for uh our industrial designer , you're gonna be thinking about the components concept . <EOS> um user interface designer gonna be thinking about our user interface , <EOS> and marketing you're gonna be thinking about trend watching . <EOS> um and you'll all get specific instructions as well . <EOS> so um i dunno , <EOS> just just to to ask now if you've got anything else you've thought about while we've been talking . <EOS> um , do you wanna start with david . <EOS> anything else to say at all ? <EOS> no , okay . <EOS> andrew ? <EOS>
okay . <EOS> okay , okay . <EOS> and new ideas about new products , <EOS> maybe , wi which would be fashion and uh <EOS> and yellow . <EOS> yellow . <EOS> i think you can think about a yellow t_v_ now after a fruit t_v_ or i dunno . <EOS> it can be an interesting i don't know <EOS>
do you think ? <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah <EOS> okay okay <EOS> um <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> sure . <EOS> mm . <EOS> well , but then for um for skipping a large amount of channels you do have to uh to skip the channel button , the number part . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> uh we found , in order of importance , people want the remote control to look cool more than they want it to to be cool . <EOS> as in they want it to do a lot of good s <EOS> they want it to look like it does a lot , <EOS> and if it does do a lot that's a bonus , <EOS> but they don't care so much , <EOS> you know . <EOS> they want it to be <EOS> that's sounds a bit like a contradiction . <EOS> technology technical technologically innovative . people want it to be that , <EOS> but s still they care more about the way it looks than what it does . <EOS> so <EOS> like the interface is really important . <EOS> and easy to use , <EOS> it it just so happens that uh from the second point to the third point is twice as important i mean the second point is twice as important as the third point . <EOS> people want it i is <EOS> it has to be cooler than easy to use , <EOS> you know , <EOS> if it has the newest features , even if it's difficult to use , prefer it to have the newest features . <EOS> and if it's easy to use that's a bonus . <EOS> the fashion , now this is seems a bit odd to me , <EOS> but fruit and veg is the new is the new black for furniture , for clothes , for shoes . <EOS> how that relates to a remote control i don't know . <EOS> but i i see <EOS> i come on to that in the next in the next slide . <EOS> spongy . <EOS> i've als i've been saying everything's the new black . <EOS> well <EOS> spongy's the new black as well . <EOS> so <EOS> we have the choice between rubber and plastic . <EOS> if it's the type of rubber that you can squeeze , you know , it's spongy , then can i skip the rest ? <EOS>
a man w w <EOS> mm . well <EOS> the speech recognition is a very good innovation i believe it , <EOS> so <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yes . <EOS> bu <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so maybe we can put one . <EOS> this this is it w with the speech recognition ? <EOS>
okay . <EOS> um <EOS> oh <EOS> could it be hard , and then something around it ? <EOS> uh yeah , <EOS> everything i've <EOS> yeah , <EOS> i would be more okay with like a titanium actual thing and then maybe like a mobile phone kind of thing . <EOS>
okay . right . <EOS> are we taking these off ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , it says you two <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> i think i think that's a g nice clean design , <EOS> it's playing to our strengths <EOS> which are in push button technology . <EOS> um hmm . <EOS> well , <EOS> the ipod spinning wheel is uh really complicated . <EOS> it does scroll , <EOS> but it is hugely complicated . <EOS> what else have we got ? <EOS>
is that no is that not trends ? <EOS> uh no , uh personally as a marketing expert i don't believe that , <EOS> because whatever companies they launch their products in the shape of fruits , they give a range of products , a range of shapes , <EOS> like if we see , look at the smallest thing , toffee chocolates , they give a variety of different things . <EOS> some children like to buy banana shape , some apple shape , some even pineapple shape , some orange shape . <EOS> so you can what shape a person will like . <EOS> so in this case giving only one or two choices we are lim limiting our customers . <EOS> and by limiting them , we are limiting our sales , limiting our profit also . <EOS>
yes . <EOS> you've you you agree . <EOS> w i i i just <EOS> so hav hav having seven buttons , instead of twelve . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so that wou would be cutting cutting suh say about these buttons . <EOS> because one <EOS> yeah <EOS> th <EOS> show me that <EOS> uh actually we could in fact we move these three buttons <EOS> and have three uh possibilities for each of the three here . here one , at the middle , and at the
oh i haven't had a look yet , <EOS> yep . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> great . <EOS> any other immediate thoughts before we move along ? <EOS> mm . <EOS> uh we can aim for <EOS> i mean we can think about all these little things , <EOS> but we can aim for something wi that gives a high battery life , <EOS> although i don't think that um it's a huge problem for remote controls anyway , battery life , <EOS> uh every now and then you need to replace the batteries . <EOS> um <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , and neither do i in fact . <EOS> bu uh . <EOS> i'll communicate that back to those guys there <EOS> a a and th the message really we wanna be sending to them is that , although teletext may become outdated w there's no l logic in not having it in there anyway
c_ and v_ . <EOS> just so we can flick <EOS> right , <EOS> where um where's the power button ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> it's in the middle of one of the little r_s . <EOS> it's the bigger r_ . <EOS> it's the r_ . <EOS> oh okay . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , so <EOS> yeah . <EOS> but , were there buttons on there as well ? <EOS> yeah well it had the wheely thing and then it had those eighteen different buttons that i don't know what they do . <EOS> so we just used the top part . <EOS>
i s i still like it . <EOS> um but that's me . <EOS> you still like it . <EOS> 'cause we've got the uh technological innovation with the speech recognition system . <EOS> right . <EOS> yes , or maybe it's just going a bit uh too far . <EOS> i mean we are pushing it probably with funny fruit shapes . <EOS> um don't wanna sort of overkill . <EOS>
i have a presentation , <EOS> i'm just making this <EOS> yeah <EOS> i think yeah the matthew it is it's important that matthew yeah is here <EOS> because okay . <EOS> ah <EOS> there is matthew . <EOS> it's really a a team uh project with a team and if someone is not here then we cannot <EOS> but it's okay it's good . <EOS>
eight to ten eight to ten hours . <EOS> n most <EOS> no most of the time it's not being used . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> so it's <EOS> yeah but y people don't like to put it back in the base station all the time people leave wanna leave it on the couch so <EOS>
uh welcome back after lunch , <EOS> i hope uh you had a good lunch <EOS> together . <EOS> for uh this meeting the main agenda okay uh to discuss about the conceptual design meeting . <EOS> okay and the agenda will be the opening <EOS> and uh that's uh the product manager or secretary that's me <EOS> and uh the presentations from the christine and uh agnes and from mister ed . <EOS> and finally in this meeting we have to decide <EOS>
yeah , <EOS> sure . <EOS> um i've had kinetic things before , <EOS> and the the the one issue we need to keep in mind with them is that you're committing the user to moving it , <EOS> and watches yeah <EOS> no , <EOS> like i said we have a h hybrid kind of thing , so it's not gonna charge the battery , it's just <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> s <EOS> lottery numbers and sport scores . <EOS> yep , <EOS> news headlines . <EOS> but if you ever see the t_v_ saying like go to page one sixty on ceefax now , that's what they're talking about . <EOS> how ? <EOS> oh . <EOS> it's earl it's pretty old technology . <EOS> it's like nineteen eighties . <EOS>
my name's tara and i'm the user interface designer . <EOS> i will also be responsible for the functional design phase , the conceptual design phase and the detailed design phase of the user interface design . <EOS> okay . <EOS> alright . <EOS> hi , <EOS> i'm genevieve . <EOS> i'm the marketing expert . <EOS> i'm an expert at marketing . <EOS> um , i'll be telling you guys about the user requirement specifications for our new product . <EOS> um , i'll be doing some trend-watching in the conceptual design , and product evaluation for the design phase . <EOS>
right . <EOS> everybody's supposed to try out the whiteboard . <EOS> kate , why don't you try it first , if you can either bring your things with you , i guess <EOS> uh yeah , if i can pick up with all these bits and pieces , <EOS> hang on . <EOS>
mm . yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> but ninety percent of the time , ninety nine percent of the time , people will be using the main functions , the volume , the different channels , <EOS> so <EOS> we can have all the fancy things as well <EOS> but the main controls need to be very obvious and very easy to use . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> very cheap uh cheap look . <EOS> yeah but this this the is for the . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> so those i think are all my <EOS> oh . <EOS> uh <EOS> . <EOS> ah yeah bright colours . <EOS> yeah . also a kind of rubber uh <EOS>
people <EOS> i thought maybe , because people always tend to throw a remote control about the place to one another <EOS> if it was in a ball , <EOS> and maybe the actual controls are inside or something . <EOS> mm . <EOS> 'kay . <EOS> mm . <EOS> um . <EOS>
slightly . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> it's gonna be very hard to reduce . <EOS> yes . <EOS> uh you got some pretty cheap labour that can do this case for one euro . <EOS> that's really <EOS> that's the cost of the material and lab wow , that's really outstanding . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . yeah . <EOS> a bit comfier , you know . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm 'kay so the shape we wanna go um how exactly ? <EOS> maybe double <EOS> like uh an hour glass kind of figure , <EOS> is that what you're thinking of , <EOS> or just like a <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> and do you have any ideas about the product uh so far ? <EOS> well how i have to fill it . well <EOS> i started i started with the first phase , <EOS> i think was the functional . <EOS> and uh let's see <EOS> i had to focus on the working design , which you said . <EOS> how does the apparatus work ? <EOS> and well <EOS> i basically had two points . <EOS>
thank you very much . <EOS> bye-bye . <EOS> yep , okay , see you later on . <EOS> thank you . <EOS> thank you again for all . <EOS> thanks <EOS> . bye . <EOS> and see you in the evening for drinks . <EOS>
uh my personal preferences uh <EOS> i also overheard in the last meeting that there shou we should use uh our own business colours . <EOS> that was correct , wasn't it ? <EOS> okay . <EOS> i think they are rather boring for um for use with rubber . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> uh , oh actually , no , <EOS> we'll allocate . <EOS> so you do the looking around at other remote controls . <EOS> um , if you could maybe come up with sort of shapes and suggested shades or whatever , <EOS> yeah . <EOS> and you could look into um basically how how it's made i_e_ like how you make it all in one , how what sort of materials are available to you whatever . <EOS> and obviously , other instructions will come from the personal coach . <EOS>
yeah <EOS> it's it's the same solution , i think . hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> b <EOS> yeah . <EOS> but even we can have some uh l_c_d_ display , <EOS> like you can uh de you can just button the number <EOS> and then it go <EOS> t because <EOS>
but let us try to see today whether we prefer to organise people , say , by projects or just professor and assistant . <EOS> that's why i was quite receptive to uh susan's remark at the beginning is <EOS> i wouldn't formulate it in a such a an extreme way as , do we really need the lounge ? <EOS> but uh i would p probably formulate it in the way that uh , do we want to have only a lounge or s something that can be used only as a reading room ? <EOS>
it must be around it then . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> then <EOS> yeah . <EOS> not not not not here , but here . <EOS> yeah . there . yeah . <EOS> maybe uh <EOS> the same as a telephone , or a mobile phone , or what do you mean ? <EOS> if you push <EOS>
and let's go back to agenda <EOS> and hook me up . <EOS> d <EOS> mm . this oughta be fun . <EOS> it probably won't go the first time , <EOS> it'll probably be like a g mess . <EOS> come on . <EOS> uh it lost it off here . uh <EOS>
hello . <EOS> . <EOS> . <EOS> yes , i made it . <EOS> english from now on . <EOS> . <EOS> just kidding . <EOS> drawing or <EOS> yeah just testing . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm ? <EOS> english . <EOS> . <EOS> so annoying . <EOS> break is over . <EOS>
right . <EOS> actually this bottom red ring here just unclips <EOS> and then you put a a new a new uh a new plate on top of that . <EOS> so <EOS> i mean there are i <EOS> we definitely priced out a spongy even spongier non-natural look um materials <EOS> which i think worked out fine . <EOS> we also continued on with the ideas that f following uh apple's colour schemes with the kind of the uh light orange and the green . <EOS>
thank you very much . <EOS> that was that was great . <EOS> um 's move on to the next presentation um on effects . <EOS> was that you ? <EOS> great . <EOS> mm 'kay . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> have i unscrewed it ? <EOS> push . <EOS> user interface , <EOS> right . <EOS> interface . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> uh . <EOS> ah , it's embedded , your microphone . <EOS> th this th th there's two two functions . <EOS> this is microphone array <EOS> yeah , that's <EOS> okay . <EOS> wait th that's the second point . <EOS> first one is we have to judge the fancy look and feel . <EOS>
thanks . <EOS> oh , <EOS> a fish . <EOS> gosh , <EOS> why didn't i think of fish ? <EOS> that's even easier to draw than cat . <EOS> a shark ? <EOS> mm this is very representational fish . <EOS> um i like them because they're sleek <EOS> and they have a lot of freedom <EOS> but they also do n uh swim in groups , <EOS> so . <EOS>
be <EOS> television . <EOS> yeah . only be used for television . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> and the video also , or not uh ? <EOS> only the television . <EOS> well <EOS> it says only for television here , huh . <EOS> oh . alright . okay . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> twenty three , yeah . it's it's going to be li <EOS> it's not going to be s so easy <EOS> but yeah . <EOS> yes , that that that that's mm . <EOS> u usually it's going to be more of an isolated do you have some more important facts <EOS> or
no . <EOS> i doubt it . <EOS> perhaps we've got features that don't exist in the excel sheet . <EOS> oh shit . <EOS> yeah mm yeah , maybe . <EOS> so <EOS> no , <EOS> it was in my uh my information , <EOS> so uh <EOS> the microphone . <EOS> yeah ? <EOS> maybe you're going scrap scrap it . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> okay . <EOS> to make it quite uh an universal uh device uh . <EOS> yeah yeah , <EOS> because the people don't use one particular brand so <EOS> or at least we have more more than five brands , which are really good . <EOS> mm . <EOS> okay . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> think a lot of the time , remotes that come with t_v_ players and t_v_s and d_v_ players , like they aren't <EOS> mm . <EOS> like an area that's put a lot of effort into , <EOS> they're very boring , <EOS> very plain . <EOS> like <EOS> it's very a very <EOS> like um <EOS> making a a stylish remote control would be a very like <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> mm . they're both going to be not basic cases . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so <EOS> th th this would be double curves ? <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> 'kay . <EOS> uh , plastic would be the material . <EOS> yeah . the basic one , yep . <EOS>
spongey can be reached by means of <EOS> those buttons ? and the simple buttons here , <EOS> so that <EOS> . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> and and the and the control thngs in the middle ? the the the arrows ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i uh y eah that's what i mean . <EOS> the arrows over here , <EOS> and here the s simple uh <EOS>
though we didn't actually <EOS> i mean other than minor discussion at meetings there wasn't except for the actual building , <EOS> but i feel like if this was a team project there actually would have been much more of the collaborative like brainstorming , use the board <EOS> well <EOS> and this would have been six months' worth of work , not like three hours' worth of meetings . <EOS>
well . <EOS> i thought there was some flexibility with that . <EOS> okay . <EOS> there is , <EOS> it's just , it is a question of and how much ca o does that mean we're gonna have to increase the price to make money . <EOS> um , from twelve fifty if we d wanna get our fift uh hundred per cent profit margin um that would mean selling it from twenty five . <EOS> if you multiply seventeen fifty by two that's thirty five . <EOS>
well <EOS> it might work one time , huh . <EOS> suppose so . <EOS> think . <EOS> ooh . <EOS> ah . oh my god , <EOS> it works . <EOS> yeah , yeah , you can . <EOS> so <EOS> it would be uh something like this from the side , but with a bit of uh curve here , <EOS> right ? <EOS>
well i think we have just have to discuss if <EOS> okay , okay , it's fine . <EOS> i dunno . <EOS> so did you enjoy your clay modelling ? <EOS> yes . of course . this is my job . <EOS> yeah ? was it a nice way to create your remote control ? <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yep . <EOS> mm . <EOS> um <EOS> six . <EOS> or maybe six , <EOS> because it's just one one i one among the issues , <EOS> i mean . yeah . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> i think i think for um <EOS> i mean most people are right-handed , <EOS> so in in terms of our greatest target group , i think it's pretty good , <EOS> but we might want to flag it for management , they want might want to um <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> zapping functions . <EOS> could be good . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> maybe . <EOS> so two remotes in one . <EOS> but then would be easier to lose one or the other . <EOS> that's right . <EOS> means the big one has to be sufficiently big . <EOS> and perhaps heavy , <EOS> so you can't move it around . <EOS>
i would have to side with that , <EOS> i think the voice recognition is simpler , <EOS> we already have the all the technology in-house , it's ready to go , it's packaged , <EOS> it's <EOS> 'kay . <EOS> what does the cost look like ron ? <EOS> is it cheaper to do the v_r_ or to do the uh touch screen ? <EOS>
okay . <EOS> i i const <EOS> i constructed a a list of criteria based on the on the general user requirements . <EOS> and each criteria is will be evaluated it's uh logical criteria <EOS> so we must users must say i if it's true or is or if it's false in a in a scale ranging from zero to seven . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so w we'll try to judge this feature uh with a one to seven scale , <EOS> one being uh no , i think . <EOS> uh just let me check . <EOS> so , four point three point five , it means it's acceptable . <EOS>
. <EOS> and you said something about speech recognition ? <EOS> yeah , <EOS> it says also <EOS> yeah . <EOS> speech recognition ? <EOS> hello . <EOS> twelve euro <EOS> twelve euro fifty . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> twelve fifty , twelve fifty . <EOS> twelve . that's an <EOS> also ninety one percent sixteen to twenty five , twenty six to thirty five years , seventy six percent , and thirty six to forty five , thirty five percent . <EOS>
mm hmm hmm hmm . <EOS> so instead of choosing the channel you are choosing the t_v_ contents of the night . <EOS> so it's pretty powerful , <EOS> and that's that's why the num buttons are reduced , because of this feature . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> and and for the materials that is cheap to produce <EOS> i think uh it's quite clear from yeah . <EOS> and also like the and the fancy designs yeah . <EOS> maybe we can improve more on the design but <EOS> uh this is the <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> you should just give it to . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> changing channel . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> numbers . <EOS> on and off . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> play , pause , stop . <EOS> so . uh . <EOS> mm-hmm . so <EOS> maybe a a minimalist design , the least uh possible amount uh of buttons . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> could these be used for going to submenus <EOS> or <EOS> yeah . yeah , so they're used for going into and out of your submenus , yeah . <EOS> maybe <EOS> yeah , <EOS> maybe it can be one of those , <EOS> if you press down and hold <EOS>
hmm . <EOS> um you can have multiple scroll buttons , <EOS> um this is maybe getting a little bit complicated , <EOS> but um it's it the technology is there . <EOS> and we can also incorporate an l_c_d_ display in the remote , <EOS> but this will increase the cost . <EOS> um the electronics that actually makes the device work , we've basically got three , simple , regular , advanced , <EOS> and the price goes up as we choose each of this . <EOS> if we want the nice cheap one , the simple , then we can only have push buttons . <EOS> all the other fancy interface designs go out the window , i'm afraid . <EOS> um pay a little bit more for a regular chip and you can have scroll buttons . <EOS> if you want the advanced chip it obviously costs more , <EOS> but it that's what you need if you want the l_c_d_ display . <EOS> and the manufacturing devision tell me that they have recently developed um sample sensor sample speaker devices . <EOS> now <EOS> i don't know what that is , <EOS> but i think they think it's quite important <EOS> and we might want to incorporate it somewhere . <EOS> um ou our real expertise is in push buttons , i have to say , <EOS> but maybe you think that's old technology . <EOS> and well <EOS> i i think we've got two options . <EOS> we can either go for a really cheap model , <EOS> keep all of the costs down , <EOS> um which means a flat plastic case with an ordinary battery and simple push buttons . <EOS> or we can have something that looks a bit nicer , <EOS> i think it , um won't necessarily l uh look like a pineapple , <EOS>
okay . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> so <EOS> as far as the design goes , the very most important aspect was the design , to the customers . <EOS> so <EOS> going with the fruit and vegetable idea , we've got the bright colours , so makes it stand out , the oranges and the the bright yellows and the florescent colours , part of the fruit and vegetables um . <EOS> going back to the idea of taking inspiration from mobile phones , <EOS> they've all got those <EOS> a lot of them have the changeable covers , <EOS> so they can choose what colour the outside is . <EOS> that's one way of looking at it um . <EOS> textured feel we just talked about . <EOS> maybe it's another way of doing that . <EOS> so if it's part of the the changeable covers then may maybe they can choose a different texture , a spongy one or a soft one or something like that . <EOS> so they can choose it li as they want to to maybe to fit in with their decor in their living room , or just what they like , their sports team or whatever . <EOS> um and yeah , <EOS> still taking the inspiration from the mobile phone design so
okay . <EOS> mm . <EOS> so it has to be simple . <EOS> uh another point is we have to skip the teletext , <EOS> because in the world of uh upcoming internet uh we think teletext is going to be uh a thing of the past . <EOS> and uh it's a function we don't need in our remote control . <EOS>
excellent . <EOS> so we have also to focus more on the internet aspects because well well te teletext is outdated now <EOS> and uh finally , it should be clear that the corporate image , that means colours and logos of the co our company should be clearly inde identified in the product . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> okay . <EOS> shapes and things . <EOS> right . <EOS> is there a particular shape that you're interested in ? <EOS> like does marketing have any research on does it need to be long ? <EOS> does it need with a square thing wha <EOS>
i think that's something that's very hard to catch , <EOS> so you you restrict the number of people who wanna try something . <EOS> the the look and the colour is something which is cool , <EOS> but i think that there's also that factor of if it's too unfamiliar <EOS> then um because when you put it on the shelf <EOS>
okay . <EOS> alright , you won't yeah . <EOS> okay , i can go ? <EOS> can i ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so now the recent investigation we we have done fo of the remote control um . <EOS> so , the most important aspect for remote controls is to be fancy look and feel and not current functional look and feel . <EOS> and um the second aspect is uh that the remote control should be uh technological innovative . <EOS> and the third most important aspect is to to is that the co remote control should be easy to use . <EOS>
yep . <EOS> okay . so , <EOS> we went over all those things <EOS> and we're satisfied with all the above . <EOS> yep . <EOS> um did we find any new ideas ? <EOS> i think with the marketing element of uh fruit shaped i i mean i that really opened my eyes . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> we'll see . we'll see . <EOS> if you have time . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah <EOS> i don't think w <EOS> i think we have to choose . <EOS> if we choose uh titanium or if we choose spongy <EOS> but uh it cannot be both . <EOS>
lemons ? <EOS> okay , um <EOS> components concept . energy , chip on print . <EOS> uh-hu oh , oh yes . <EOS> right , <EOS> i had sort of skipped over that hoping it wouldn't get <EOS> g <EOS> be necessary <EOS> but um <EOS> that's th th this is the agenda they gave me . <EOS> so <EOS> can you just explain what that is real quick ? <EOS>
alima . <EOS> okay . <EOS> um i don't know which one of these i have to bring with me . <EOS> probably both . <EOS> right , so , <EOS> i'm supposed to draw my favourite animal . <EOS> i have no drawing skills whatsoever . <EOS> but uh let's see , introduce myself . <EOS> my name is alima bucciantini . <EOS> um i'm from the state of maine in the us . <EOS> i'm doing nationalism studies , <EOS> blah , blah , blah , <EOS> and i have no artistic talents . <EOS>
hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> whether it works or not , they have to first say i like this , i like the design , <EOS> and then it's gotta be simple to use . <EOS> yes , so what i uh prefer maybe uh you need to interact uh more with the christine , okay , <EOS> because you know what she is going to do it , okay , <EOS> and you know how to sell it . okay , <EOS> because uh she is doing the design , <EOS> but you are the core because you are in the marketing , okay , <EOS> so because you need to sell and you're the responsible for the all the money , the finance , okay , tomorrow . <EOS>
th <EOS> okay , <EOS> well just very quickly <EOS> 'cause this we're supposed to finish now . <EOS> um i guess that's up to us , <EOS> i mean you probably want some kind of unique selling point of it , <EOS> so um , you know <EOS> yep . <EOS> yeah , sure . <EOS> okay . <EOS>
yeah . yeah . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so <EOS> the last uh concept is intelligent . <EOS> we want uh we want our controller to be smart , <EOS> so maybe we should uh use um uh <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> technology , such as speech recognition technology and gesture recognition technology , <EOS> so we need to have coop some cooperation with some research institute on speech recognition and um gesture recognition . um <EOS> with this advanced features we i think we can attract a lot of user . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> uh-huh . <EOS> but in electronics , i think , it's not q always quite so um you don't always have so many choices as with chocolates . <EOS> i think , you know , if you're going to buy a t_v_ maybe a company'll have that you're going to choose from , a company'll have two or three choices , but they're different designs . <EOS> we were coming up with one product . <EOS>
is that price per unit , or for the whole yeah <EOS> th <EOS> now this is per per unit , this number of components . <EOS> ah good . <EOS> thing ? so it would need twelve buttons . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> we might need a scroll wheel , right , for that ? <EOS>
volume button . how many volumes ? <EOS> right okay . <EOS> on mute . <EOS> and a mute , yeah . <EOS> that's sixteen isn't it , yeah . <EOS> is there anything else ? <EOS> um . <EOS> i don't think so , no . <EOS> power button , stand-by , channel , up and down . <EOS> so is that it ? <EOS>
mm . <EOS> yeah , yeah , yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> no , but i i i was just defending the the fact why why we want to keep the remote control close to us , a and uh not to yell at it from the distance . <EOS>
'kay . <EOS> that's more on the research end , but the marketing . <EOS> so marketing , <EOS> you know , <EOS> how maybe uh <EOS> marketing , you could s find out what is the most universally um appealing remote control out there . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> and maybe as far as design goes , maybe we could have different ones for different target audiences , <EOS> 'cause maybe one won't apply to all of the countries we're targeting . <EOS>
but the television would be the display <EOS> that <EOS> things like that usually c pop up on a televi <EOS> like you hit menu <EOS> and menu will come up on television <EOS> and have like tint brightness , <EOS> and you'd use the scroll , scroll through it yeah . <EOS>
uh uh okay . <EOS> i'll just <EOS> sorry about this . . <EOS> and is to cover things like um what the parts might be made of , um , <EOS> can we uh outsource these from elsewhere , <EOS> um will we have to construct any items ourselves ? <EOS>
okay , <EOS> so let's try it , <EOS> let's t <EOS> the l_c_d_ would <EOS> the display would only be display and not uh touch sensitive you mean . <EOS> just uh for output , <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , yeah , <EOS> it's it's not gonna be a touch pad , uh just a display for giving you information . <EOS>
and for the <EOS> sorry . <EOS> no , it's fine . <EOS> for the body design i think plastic , <EOS> uh w yeah <EOS> we could use the body , <EOS> for the inside <EOS> and uh rubber as a padding or for the grip , something like to add to the design . <EOS>
right . <EOS> okay . <EOS> right . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> okay cool . <EOS> right , 'kay . <EOS> it might even be one , a bit more complex l_c_d_ panel with pictures like maybe the sun or the , you know , the the symbols of the various functions . <EOS>
mm yes <EOS> but w we're targeting i think on more on the on the twenty to forty group . <EOS> okay . <EOS> so <EOS> they're <EOS> yeah . <EOS> people yes . who just have or already have a job and have the money but mm-hmm . <EOS> may not want to spend that much money on a on a universal universal control .
and when would you like that ? <EOS> okay , and it's po <EOS> b as soon as possible . <EOS> uh well if uh if we have enough time uh then d do you think um two weeks is a is close enough ? <EOS> yes i think uh that would be good , <EOS> because i need to go to the management and uh tell them what we are going to do , and uh what cost is , okay , and what's the time frame and what's the project plan , <EOS> because uh without any uh documentations , i cannot go to the management and say , so we are going to do this and we need this much money , <EOS> okay , so then it's it's difficult for me to say , okay , that's the reason i need uh some kind of plan from you , initially , okay , <EOS> then we can have the further discussion again . <EOS>
one , two . <EOS> one . <EOS> two . <EOS> right so i put one on that . <EOS> okay i'll um i'll just do the calculations now <EOS> if you want to continue . <EOS> or is it tedious ? <EOS> i'm i'm sorry this was so tedious for everyone . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> oh <EOS> yeah . <EOS> sure . <EOS> well <EOS> have we confirmed that we're gonna go ahead with a uh touch screen um <EOS> yeah yeah okay . um <EOS> interface ? <EOS> yeah i think that would be best . <EOS> let's <EOS> based on what sh on what you guys have all said to me let's go for a plastic built or uh b plastic cased <EOS> 'cause tha tha that's easy on the cost , <EOS> try to look for some kind of high quality recycled plastic <EOS> as you recommended <EOS> and i think that's a great idea . <EOS> with a touch screen for the basic functions . um <EOS> and we'll <EOS> yeah <EOS> tha <EOS> let's provisionally let's go for a touch screen one with several submenus um for possible extra stuff <EOS> that one <EOS> basically put the channel and the on and off switch on the touch screen . <EOS> um do we have <EOS> mm wait a minute <EOS> it occurs to me that if we have a touch screen people are going to have to recharge their remote controls . <EOS> yet at the same time that might help for this whole complaint of it being lost . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> in a lot other ways too . <EOS> okay . so <EOS> i'm getting <EOS> alright so <EOS> more or less you guys think that o o of the two of 'em , the voice recognition will be better . <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i think it's our lower risk option <EOS> which for right now we can have it on the market sooner <EOS> which is all in all our best option . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> and also in the in the u_s_a_ the the current the mor the most popular feeling it's it's a spongy . <EOS> spongy means eponge ? <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> so maybe we should we should think in in this direction , so <EOS> what what do you mean by fruit and vegetables and spongy ? <EOS> what you mean clothe <EOS>
well yeah , that's the thing , <EOS> if <EOS> you can but you have to pro though i think it's a fairly simple design so you would have to record into the device every possible combination , <EOS> you have to s tr train it to l to learn channel fifteen , that whole thing , <EOS> not just the word channel and the word fifteen , it doesn't have that kind of logic in it . <EOS> so <EOS>
it's about sixteen , seventeen pounds , i think . <EOS> is that too <EOS> is that a lot of money to buy an extra remote or a replacement remote ? <EOS> right . <EOS> um so maybe not the high end range , but maybe middle , middle up-ish . <EOS> kind of . <EOS> you know how much ? <EOS> i dunno <EOS> i guess you pay , what , ten ten quid for a remote ? <EOS> like a simple replacement , right . <EOS> i mean if you lost your remote and the first thing you just wanna go out and get , <EOS> would you <EOS> how much would you pay ? <EOS>
okay . <EOS> wha what we really see this year is that uh everything from clothes to shoes and furniture is is inspired by fruits and vegetables , <EOS> okay , <EOS> so i think we really have to take this into account for the design of the the thing . <EOS>
s <EOS> very stuff <EOS> okay , rubber rubber desi okay , yeah . yeah . <EOS> device , <EOS> so um <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay , <EOS> tha tha that was the main point , i think , from the trend in fashion . <EOS> okay . <EOS> so <EOS> we have to take decisions about the component concepts , about the energy . <EOS> so , <EOS> as you say you want something technologically innovative , <EOS> maybe using solar energy and with battery would be something interesting , <EOS> maybe will attract <EOS>
okay . <EOS> uh where has my screen gone ? <EOS> hi . <EOS> hello , good day . <EOS> yep . <EOS> oh yeah , <EOS> we have to talk in english , <EOS> huh . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> my screen is gone . <EOS> oh . <EOS>
we have the lightning , <EOS> or <EOS> yeah , <EOS> we have the <EOS> we don't sesh especially have the lightning <EOS> but <EOS> the lighting . <EOS> so you'll make the material transparent <EOS> so that it uh lights up completely , <EOS> or <EOS> so <EOS> it's yellow . <EOS> it's okay . <EOS> i think it's very easy to <EOS> i would say seven . <EOS> it's hard to miss it . <EOS>
hmm . <EOS> would you be able to get rid of the the extra buttons here , the the sort of circular section , <EOS> because that seems to be for a video as well . <EOS> so we could dispense with that little bit as well <EOS> and just get it down to just the numbers and the volume . <EOS> possibly ? <EOS>
yeah <EOS> so <EOS> okay so , here are a a plastic , <EOS> uh latex <EOS> i like the rubber , the stress balls , i think , <EOS> you know , that could be a bit of a gimmick like it's good to hold and <EOS> oh right , okay . <EOS>
i'm gonna be doing the apparently according to the little guy in the computer that knows everything the user g requirements specification of the functional design , um trend watching in the conceptual design and product evad-valuation in the detailed design <EOS> um so yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS>
really need to wrap up now . <EOS> have a modern , <EOS> have a traditional , <EOS> have a you know , <EOS> and so so instead of them all looking the same , people can have maybe four or five different designs they can choose from . <EOS> i don't know what that creates cost , or <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah yeah . <EOS> no <EOS> that's actu <EOS> but the but the buttons have their own leds or not ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> they have leds but they have a colour . <EOS> red and green are actually the b the easiest to discriminate . even for colourblind . <EOS> they will see one of each as grey . <EOS> but if you use uh green on blue , those kind of colours will look the same . <EOS>
um okay <EOS> i'll will give it an uh an eye . <EOS> okay . <EOS> that's nice of you . <EOS> uh . <EOS> hey . come on . <EOS> some leaf to eat . <EOS> okay . yeah pretty good . <EOS> uh could you press the next uh <EOS>
yeah d d uh . <EOS> so i it's just going to add t to the cost . <EOS> yeah but s still we have to mm we have to have an advantage over our competitors . <EOS> i think this is a good advantage . <EOS> it's cool . <EOS> i think i like the idea , <EOS> but i'm not sure about the what you , <EOS> who is giving who's giving who's giving our budget . who's <EOS>
mm . <EOS> so i already mentioned the speech recognition interface . <EOS> i guess , we we basically vetoed that idea . <EOS> it's it's pointless . <EOS> mm . <EOS> uh it's just a sample sensor sample output . <EOS> it would just be probably the most expensive part of our remote without any actual interesting functionality as far as operating the t_v_ . <EOS>
l_d_c_ doesn't require <EOS> yeah , <EOS> it says in the email . <EOS> the display requires an advanced chip . <EOS> okay . <EOS> and speech recognition ? <EOS> yeah , probably too . <EOS> i i haven't got anything about speech recognition , <EOS> but <EOS> advanced . yeah . <EOS> i'll i'll give you my design . <EOS>
yeah , you have a , like that , and so on . <EOS> and you you can <EOS> yeah ju just imagine you have fifty fifty channels uh <EOS> oh yeah . <EOS> y uh fifth channel divided by the num by the by three hundred thirteen degree . <EOS> so you got how many degree you you it <EOS>
that's cute . <EOS> channels that only these children would watch , <EOS> so it's like they ch watch , you know , the c_ beebies or something like that , <EOS> uh keep them away from other channels . <EOS> so that's like another ar um , <EOS> i mean , these are three examples sort of looking at it . <EOS> you have the wider section for the main controls there . <EOS> uh you could see how many buttons there are . <EOS> and then on the left you have an example of the round buttons , and a simpler design . <EOS> on the bottom we probably wouldn't need that , <EOS> because it's more for like a d_v_d_ function which we are not gonna be using . um . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> like with a with a mouse , you have not , yeah . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> in a breath it's <EOS> uh the remote control to um <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> charted . <EOS> we should think of the twelve fifty we have <EOS> but <EOS> to refill the <EOS>
okay . yeah . <EOS> so what should i draw ? <EOS> mm . <EOS> he has already to do cat . <EOS> i took a dog . <EOS> um . a mouse ? <EOS> this looks likes a cat who has been driven over . <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> and we should sum up its favourite charas characteristics , <EOS> right ? <EOS>
okay , just <EOS> yeah , just uh we have to design the inside then , <EOS> but it should be uh <EOS> yeah , and <EOS> or are we making a slide open , like underneath ? <EOS> or fold open ? <EOS> i don't know . <EOS> slide open is uh quite usable for remote controls . <EOS>
huh ? <EOS> oh , <EOS> it is a turtle . <EOS> it is a turtle . <EOS> why a turtle ? why ? tim ? <EOS> um 'cause i liked teenage mutant hero turtles . <EOS> you watched it a lot ? <EOS> you watched it a lot ? <EOS>
no , <EOS> you can erase the turtle , <EOS> it's alright . <EOS> i'll <EOS> i should leave that one on there <EOS> shouldn't i <EOS> before i callously rub it off . <EOS> might be nice to have them all up there at same time . <EOS> um i'm not gonna draw it quite to scale um . <EOS>
just in inexpensive or <EOS> and how how does it work ? <EOS> is it <EOS> doesn't say . <EOS> just you say record , followed by your question sample , and after a few seconds the answer uh sample . <EOS> because <EOS> uh so <EOS> it works like uh good morning remote control , <EOS> and then the remote control says good morning . <EOS>
uh <EOS> play , pause , doesn't n need to be there . <EOS> well , <EOS> we don't have the video orders <EOS> yes , <EOS> so <EOS> this is your presentation . <EOS> we could check the other remote controls with technical functions . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> you could look here <EOS> all the the <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> it's your job <EOS> oh . <EOS> uh . <EOS> uh sorry <EOS> got a message from microsoft . <EOS> okay um before that i i have some some some thing uh to say before um <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah yeah . <EOS> we know that uh the user use uh a lot their um remote control um to to change channel . <EOS> um and um to to change uh volume selection of the <EOS> and uh and not uh a lot for setting for setting the the channels and uh thing things like that . <EOS> so it's better to put uh uh uh something very easy to set <EOS> and uh and <EOS>
uh <EOS> like doing a spongy layer of the banana , and you open it . <EOS> i think if we if we have a spongy layer on the outside of the banana then it's easy to make that , <EOS> you know , to manipulate that to hav be a cover that you can pull off and <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> will recognise that's as a remote control . <EOS> uh when i saw your d <EOS> oh . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> uh look something like that . autumn colours like red , brown . <EOS> they liked the wood a lot . <EOS> so maybe we could give it like wooden loo look look or something in that colour . <EOS> and a bit bit old school style renaissance , medieval kind of things . <EOS>
doing the marketing . <EOS> nothing related here to the <EOS> marketing in this design . <EOS> a design is basically for industrial design and the user interface . <EOS> yes . <EOS> you see the second mail ? <EOS> yeah , it's inside . <EOS> go down . <EOS> appendix . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> i guess that means specifying um what exactly the user is going to be looking for . <EOS> right ? <EOS> i would think so . okay . <EOS> and you're gonna get more specific instructions emailed to you in just a little while . <EOS> okay , so does anybody have anything they wanna say before we close the meeting ? <EOS>
my team wasn't very clear . <EOS> that's okay . <EOS> only use ten percent of the buttons . <EOS> i i think it's like the engineering versus user , <EOS> whereas like the engineering she showed that the engineering ones are more complex <EOS> and users don't really need all of the buttons that are contained on there , because they only use ten percent of the buttons really . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> but still there there's an opportunity . <EOS> if if it's , for example , a trainable one then we're just simply having like an up , down , left , right , an okay button or something like that might might do as well in future proofing it . <EOS>
maybe if you click back in that bottom right cell , where you're starting from , and then use the arrow keys . <EOS> does that work ? <EOS> no mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , i know , that just extends it as well . <EOS> i don't know . <EOS>
yeah yeah yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> oh <EOS> activate and th the yeah . <EOS> so okay b but you have t you need some button to flip this open . <EOS> why ? <EOS> you could just make it mechanical . <EOS> true . true . <EOS> but you can make a , yeah , you can make a trigger here . <EOS> you know a simple uh with a <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> fine . <EOS> i got a end meeting now message on my mo <EOS> yeah <EOS> so . um <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> did it ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> again a questionnaire huh ? <EOS> so i think we've probably got <EOS> it says , closing we have forty minutes <EOS> so i um think we've probably got about that time before we come back . <EOS>
d display uh of it , it's uh just a small display . <EOS> uh um you can put it uh on top . <EOS> um it's uh most uh uh place where people uh , most of looks at . <EOS> so uh um <EOS> and a special uh button for shifting up uh and uh shifting down uh channel , um it's uh on place where um the thumb of of the <EOS> so you you can uh easily uh shift up or shift down . <EOS> um it's uh quite uh handy place . <EOS> so um and uh <EOS> all the f functions for subtitle uh one button , uh for sound uh <EOS> uh and uh for our design , um uh we have to discuss about it uh i think uh so uh the form of it <EOS> so <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> then , these are some of the remotes which are different in shape and colour , but they have many buttons . <EOS> so uh sometimes the user finds it very difficult to recognise which button is for what function and all that . <EOS> so you can you can design an interface which is very simple , and which is user-friendly . <EOS> even a kid can use that . <EOS> so can you go on t t uh to the next slide . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . okay . <EOS> yeah <EOS> i got another point . <EOS> it uses infrared light to communicate the signal to the t_v_ apparatus or stereo . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> wireless uh huh . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> alright . <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> right . right . <EOS> question is what makes those game pads functional ? <EOS> w <EOS> i think that's pretty much the form for full hand . <EOS> so it's a round shape underneath that makes it comfy , <EOS> right , <EOS> makes it nice , <EOS> so that's the essential part . <EOS> except for that i think we'll not probably not get a get away from some longer design . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> make 'em more appealing as well . <EOS> but um other than that , <EOS> i mean uh and that's um , you know , that's just something , <EOS> i think i think it's great , yeah , great idea . <EOS> do you think it says r_r_ ? <EOS>
okay , <EOS> the component design . <EOS> i looked at uh some similar devices , and uh my own common knowledge . <EOS> so uh <EOS> this was on the web site . <EOS> if you aim at a young public , you should use materials that are soft with primary colours like green , blue , red . so flashy kinda colours . <EOS> uh shapes should be curved , so round shapes . not nothing square-like . <EOS>
technologically it should be like um work , basically , i guess . it should work . <EOS> well it should be it should be maybe cutting edge in some sense , <EOS> i mean have something that's little more technologically advanced than what's on the market . <EOS> should <EOS> that's new . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> no <EOS> i think it's lost a battery . <EOS> mm , try it , just try it . <EOS> oh it will not <EOS> ri <EOS> mm , <EOS> mm . <EOS> no <EOS> it's <EOS> it would still write <EOS> but it wouldn't pick it up with the sensors . <EOS>
oh excellent yeah . <EOS> cool . <EOS> that sounds good . <EOS> fabulous . <EOS> alright . <EOS> i guess we'll just hit the bricks . <EOS> thanks guys . <EOS> cool . <EOS>
sorry . <EOS> have a bit of oh oh you can see it , okay . um dissonance between what our budget was and what we want it to look like . um want it to look uncluttered , undaunting to the customer . <EOS> we discussed a flip-open design , <EOS> um reducing the size of the control <EOS> and an electronic panel um for further features like programming , things like that . <EOS>
yep . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> and you can celebrate your leadership . <EOS> oh , thanks a lot . <EOS> thank you , mister david jordan . <EOS> yeah but i think f <EOS> it's really a celebrating object . <EOS> so it's yellow and very a very ha it's very happy , so . <EOS> uh it's it's a pr it's like yeah . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> give it a t give it a two . <EOS> yeah , okay . <EOS> 'kay , criteria four is costs . <EOS> 's great . <EOS> cost . <EOS> it's come in under budget . <EOS> so that's a definite one . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> i i think it's <EOS> but uh but i i think uh left to right is more often associated with volume , and top down is more with uh channel changing . <EOS> it's it's obvious , i think . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> that's not not it's not al uh always the same . <EOS> every remote control's uh different . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so okay . <EOS> this is just for t_v_ , it's not for or it is does need to be compatible with <EOS> channel selection . <EOS> i <EOS> um <EOS> a d_v_d_ is simple , you just have play , pause , eject , <EOS>
hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> a big learning curve , yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so , i it should kind of fit in as well , <EOS> and the stereotype of a <EOS> yeah . <EOS> it's like those fancy websites that you can't access <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> um one final thing we came up with was some information on the speech recognition . <EOS> there's a small unit available through the company um which obviously would be an extra cost , <EOS> but it wouldn't affect the size of the remote too much . <EOS> um and i guess that would require a more advanced circuit board , <EOS> so there is an extra price in that sense . <EOS> there is th sorry an extra cost in that sense . <EOS> um going to my personal preferences , um i thought possibly for power we could use kinetic <EOS> um which is the idea of the watches um that you move <EOS> you move the remote around to power it up . <EOS> and this would avoid batteries running out , having to replace batteries and such like . <EOS> um for the buttons , i thought we'd probably get away with just having the standard um push buttons rather than the scroll wheel . <EOS> um and for the circuit board , again depends on which features we want in the actual in the remote . <EOS> so if we wanted the scroll wheel and wanted the voice recognition , um then we'd have to get a a more costly circuit board . <EOS> and that's it . <EOS>
if it's just for t_v_ , which is what it is at the moment . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> so we get to <EOS> how many buttons have we got ? <EOS> we've just got ten , eleven twelve th <EOS> we got fourteen that we need . i guess . <EOS>
ron ? <EOS> phew . <EOS> computer's adjusting . <EOS> one moment please . <EOS> so <EOS> interme <EOS> interface concept by your faithful user interface designer . <EOS> so yur user interface , guys , is basically aspects of a computer system that we can see or hear , or otherwise uh perceive . <EOS> uh , commands and mechanisms , that basically user uses to control the operator operating system . <EOS> here's a d series of different remote controls <EOS> that are out on the market today . <EOS> i think we're definitely trying to get away from this kind of a look . <EOS> um , so <EOS>
this <EOS> of course your animal is recorded so it's not lost . <EOS> sorry too uh . <EOS> yes . <EOS> i know . <EOS> is this uh <EOS> wha what is this strange beast ? <EOS> is it beautiful ? <EOS> is it a monster ? <EOS> do you know ? <EOS> it's a cat . <EOS> isn't it ? <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah yeah yeah . <EOS> i mean <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm . <EOS> i just put the values in . <EOS> but um the screen is the same as what , <EOS> and if if you consider our budget , it probably <EOS> if you consider our budget , to h have speech recognition programmed in every single remote might be a little pricey . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> right so um yeah . <EOS>
yeah , <EOS> so <EOS> yeah . <EOS> you know . <EOS> so i mean if we're if we're over budget then maybe we could we could rethink that . <EOS> okay . <EOS> so no l_c_d_ , <EOS> so for we have no button supplements , <EOS> right ? <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> uh . <EOS> you can put it on your table with the l_c_d_ screen , <EOS> you don't have to put it get it in your hand , <EOS> you can put it next to you <EOS> and then dive it in <EOS> and . yeah . <EOS>
oh . well , <EOS> it depends <EOS> you know like <EOS> there is uh it's a very small vocabulary that you want to do the operations like you want to say on , off , mm . one , two , but it's quite noisy if there is the t_v_ uh shouting . <EOS>
the the quest the question to be addressed here is only who is the target group and how will it function , <EOS> and i think the how will it function is probably the question of the buttons you know , within the target group or subgroups . <EOS> the question is only whether our budget will allow to have more than one design in a sense . <EOS> i mean the basic design i understand will be the same , <EOS> but the question is how much will that set us back if let's say uh forty percent we make large buttons and the rest we make regular buttons for example . <EOS>
i think it's <EOS> i'm not i'm not sure , <EOS> it's not mm i think <EOS> so <EOS> i <EOS> yeah , it probably would be universal . <EOS> universal . <EOS> and only television ? <EOS> or more devices ? <EOS> because <EOS> i don't think you can buy a a a universal uh remote control for twenty five euros , <EOS> so <EOS> not sure , <EOS> but <EOS>
mm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> um , so again you can have a little l_c_d_ light somewhere , the flip thing and <EOS> have i forgotten anything ? <EOS> i don't think so . <EOS> so , as you can see , it's a very very simple design , <EOS> which is one of the things i really wanted to keep , is keep it simple , not have too many buttons , not have too many functionalities thrown into it . <EOS> think the design can pretty much carry over to everything , <EOS> although with the wood the flip screen might have to do something slightly different . <EOS>
uh it's i think it's basically the more you move i it , it's got a wee thing inside that just kinda powers it . <EOS> uh yeah . <EOS> right , it's like those watches that you c <EOS> so , this might be an idea for something that people really wanna grab , you can shake it if it's out of power . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> y yeah . <EOS> and they don't always talk to each other . <EOS> don't know . <EOS> okay . <EOS> are there any um ideas for the remote ? <EOS> what would it be for <EOS> and what group would be be for ? <EOS> we have to think about that one . <EOS>
right . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm . <EOS> right . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> okay , <EOS> so it seems like a feasible thing to implement uh for for a limited <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> but maybe if you wanna look into that just to just to check . <EOS> um , so if we go for the the fifteen to thirty five age group <EOS>
oh right , okay , brilliant . like that from its centre . <EOS> where you're , yeah , uh were you're holding it kind of <EOS> yeah . <EOS> well , if you hold it , <EOS> you can you all can hold it , <EOS> is <EOS> it does actually feel quite ergonomic , <EOS> if you've got small hands . <EOS> um , obviously i don't think that's real sized . <EOS> it would have to be a bit bigger . <EOS> okay . <EOS> um that's a speaker at the top , <EOS> so you can speak into it like a little walkie-talkie as well for speak recognition . <EOS>
should i bring my uh pen too ? <EOS> or <EOS> okay . <EOS> uh i also forgot my mouse , <EOS> but i don't need my mouse , i think . <EOS> mouse . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i do . <EOS> come on . <EOS> there we are . <EOS>
it <EOS> wel well <EOS> yeah , <EOS> it would <EOS> i mean each version of it has been a little bit different , <EOS> but <EOS> the one i have doesn't have the four on i like around it , i don't think . <EOS> oh yeah , <EOS> you had one of the in-between ones , <EOS> when they weren't doing that anymore . <EOS> ts <EOS> and you press the centre button , <EOS> that's that's your all-purpose select button right there . <EOS>
an interesting point is that if the person doesn't have the computer , we can still make the process easier <EOS> because instead of having to look up codes , maybe we can have it that one of the options they have is that they look up the name of the company on the l_c_d_ <EOS> and then they maybe look up different names of um different actual units that have been produced . <EOS> or we have the remote control just go through them until it's like does this do the correct function , and such . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> well , every customer , okay , they have their own ideas , they have their own test , okay , so there's no end , there's no limit . <EOS> like people don't like wood . <EOS> no , but there's a difference between releasing a product that has been minimally tested and fine-tuned to suit a general range of requirements versus releasing a product that we think will work but we don't really have anything to back it up . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah , definitely . <EOS> yes . <EOS> voices . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah , definitely , yeah , two mu mute buttons . <EOS> yes . <EOS> yes . <EOS> the volume control . <EOS> maybe we can put that all on one button . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> okay , okay . <EOS> i dunno . <EOS> mm , that's a nice world . <EOS> so just just just just think about it um . <EOS> are are you saying here that uh the remote controls should be aware of who is using it ? <EOS> so <EOS> for instance the young guy would not be able to use it <EOS> because his father doesn't want . <EOS> like with some <EOS>
it it's <EOS> at least it's a lot better than uh current remote controls . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay , just give it a two . <EOS> a two . okay . <EOS> the fancy look-and-feel . <EOS> that's about our uh flashing lights and the background uh lights uh from from from the buttons . <EOS> okay . <EOS> and we can change the colours , so that's uh really fancy i think . <EOS> so <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i can't whistle . <EOS> no , no , i can't . <EOS> mm . <EOS> you can clap . can you ? <EOS> clap is good . <EOS> tak <EOS> clap clap clap it's a good <EOS> i i think it's universal . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> i would do a battery we do . <EOS> right ? <EOS> a battery . one battery , <EOS> right ? <EOS> solar cell . <EOS> no <EOS> it took a battery ? <EOS> we'll wait . <EOS> no , no solar cell , no no no no . <EOS>
user interface concept . <EOS> and a flashy light . <EOS> so uh <EOS> i'm not sure . <EOS> but we do i don't know if we expected to draw on this one at this moment . <EOS> but <EOS> i dunno either . <EOS> mm . or should we do it in the next meeting ? <EOS>
the first time i've ever done anything like yeah project project management . <EOS> i usually organise crap , <EOS> it's one thing to do , you know set up a party with your friends , <EOS> you know ? <EOS> hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> little different . <EOS>
yeah . that's a good point . <EOS> mm i don't have any information on pricing . <EOS> so i'll have to ask the manufacturing department . <EOS> mm . <EOS> 'cause in our earlier um market research , <EOS> if you'd allow me to go to the flat board , smartboard . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> mm . yeah , that's the only thing , yeah . <EOS> but yeah , then you have like the little se separate module by the t_v_ speaker <EOS> that we should just stick on , <EOS> yeah . <EOS> that comes with our remote control . <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> and fruit and vegetables <EOS> yeah . <EOS> we go to the fruits and vede vegetables . <EOS> and the other point i haven't mention is people wan want to have a spongy touch , <EOS> okay so <EOS> this is this maybe doesn't really fit with the wooden design . <EOS>
totally . <EOS> so the plu the plus <EOS> w once that's written down on the page that'll be really simple , <EOS> won't it ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah <EOS> i think <EOS> just because it's we've decided to reduce it down to the basic buttons , i think that in itself makes it so much easier to use . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> so like you walk in , you're like , oh i like that remote control , because it's so bright , and then , and then the shop assistant comes up and says , oh what colour would you like ? <EOS> and then they go like , oh i can choose the colour wow . <EOS> so it puts , i think , even the customer into more control over what they're buying instead of , you've got all colour it's either that or nothing . <EOS> so they also get to pick . <EOS> well , personally i like walking into a shop and choosing a colour . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> i'm just wondering actually , 'cause , you know , i this whole fruit thing with the banana , it's um it seemed like it first seems a bit kind of uh niche , like only a few people would really want a banana , <EOS> but what if it was kind of uh a stylised banana ? <EOS> you know , rather than having it kind of you know yellow and really looking exactly like a banana , you could make it kind of silver . <EOS>
it's different . <EOS> 'cause in san diego th the tortillas are cooked on the grill <EOS> and in northern california they steam them . <EOS> it must make all the difference . <EOS> yeah , it really does . <EOS> well <EOS> it's it's i <EOS> there's other things too <EOS> there's <EOS> you just can't place it <EOS> like <EOS> i when i went to school in the u_ in santa barbara <EOS> which is central california <EOS>
yeah , three quarters . <EOS> so uh so you don't have to put your oh . <EOS> yeah <EOS> the buttons won't get that small when the l_c_d_ screen is <EOS> uh new , blank . <EOS> so uh <EOS> when you get this uh <EOS> ooh <EOS> uh kinda like this . <EOS>
yeah , it's gotta be sellable . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , that's true what you were saying , <EOS> i mean it doesn't have to have a flip function , it can just have a lock function , <EOS> so that it's not uh not usable when you don't want it to be usable . <EOS>
yeah yeah yeah yeah . <EOS> but it won't get that small <EOS> because you have how much ? nine ten eleven twelve thirteen fourteen fifteen buttons on the screen . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> one to zero , the two digit , <EOS> yeah you don't want it too small . <EOS> how yeah how large <EOS>
mm . <EOS> um <EOS> i just had a question uh <EOS> do you want to continue with your presenta ? <EOS> is it <EOS> yeah i i will continue . <EOS> well ask your question if you want . <EOS> um you say that i don't remember by heart but thirty per cent <EOS>
they're a special colour . <EOS> um they're uh they're a special form , 'cause they're indented . <EOS> are they ? <EOS> oh , right . <EOS> and then s <EOS> yeah . <EOS> and , they're a special material . <EOS> mm . well , we're under cost then . <EOS> alright . <EOS> no , we're under . <EOS> twelve point five is our limit . <EOS> we've got eleven point two . <EOS>
maybe you can buy separate ones <EOS> and uh <EOS> and um uh <EOS> uh buy the product . you buy , you get one . and uh basic . <EOS> or you can choose one uh if you buy the project . <EOS> yeah . um <EOS> i think <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
ah yeah . <EOS> yep . yeah <EOS> i've i've got one at home . <EOS> and you can uh program i think eight different devices in it , <EOS> and you can use it for your television , anything else . <EOS> and it also operates on infra-red , <EOS> so you have to got the little device inside your room , <EOS> and then you can operate it from the third or th or second floor . <EOS> so that's pretty handy when you have a video recorder or d_v_d_ player downstairs and you've got a link to your t_v_ on the second floor . so that's a pretty handy um <EOS>
okay everyone , well done . <EOS> good meeting . <EOS> alright , <EOS> see you in thirty minutes . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so , do we take these off ? <EOS> i don't <EOS>
um . <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay , <EOS> just a second . <EOS> um . <EOS> uh . the so i will ask you to do some work . <EOS> uh the the interface interface developer will work on the on the design of the remote control , <EOS> start to to have new idea and <EOS>
hey mouse . <EOS> open . <EOS> and you wanna get <EOS> when we're fighting over it's also more lot more fun . <EOS> view a slide show , that's what you wanna do , yeah ? <EOS> just go up to view . <EOS> uh . <EOS> click , don't yeah . <EOS>
true . <EOS> true . <EOS> right . <EOS> cou could we not do something where like just a little lit like literally just a very small kind of thing <EOS> that comes with the remote <EOS> that you could place something else <EOS> that you press <EOS> and it makes the remote page . <EOS> kinda like how on a lot of um uh cordless regular phones , you have a page button and it goes , <EOS> could we do something like that ? <EOS>
i'd give it a three . <EOS> i'd be tempted with three , yeah . <EOS> three . <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> we'll get panned on the next one , anyway . <EOS> materials that people find pleasing . <EOS> sponginess is what they really would have wanted , apparently . <EOS>
and she was challenged on that point <EOS> um <EOS> that's right . <EOS> yes . <EOS> but uh her very f personal favourite really she , she would very much like to see a speech recogniser integrated in this remote . <EOS> the industrial designer um presented her uh thoughts on the issue . <EOS> she would like a special case made out of plastic that is very strong , not using any harmful materials , should be recyclable and should be colourful . <EOS> should have an integrated circuit board that's highly sophisticated and temperature resistant . <EOS> she would like to see a timer and or alarm facility integrated . <EOS> uh technically this thing would also have a resistor and a capacitor , diode transistor , resonator , <EOS> and if possible a rechargeable battery . <EOS> uh and of course a circuit board . <EOS> and how it would works , you press the button , the chip is morse morse code related relays the uh to the generat to the generator amplification <EOS> and uh the circuit board is very inexpensive to build <EOS> and so she thinks this is a great feature uh to to to consider . <EOS>
what if , um , you had like a b a cover that went over buttons that you don't use very much ? <EOS> like you <EOS> so you could slide it up if you needed to like change the contrast or something like that ? <EOS> so the options are there but they're not in interfering with the design and the practicality of it . <EOS>
yes . <EOS> well , so maybe we we can j we can already think uh about a way to to access the internet via the television . <EOS> mm . <EOS> because if <EOS> using the t_v_ to access the internet ? or what ? <EOS> i didn't quite understand <EOS>
uh well um <EOS> this is how it is now . um <EOS> here uh well we have volume . <EOS> i think it is on uh on the bottom too . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> down there . <EOS> but it's not not the best best . <EOS> yeah . well <EOS> here we have also side scrolls . <EOS> i dunno if we can use that . do we want to use <EOS>
so , three . <EOS> and what's your opinion ? <EOS> uh we wouldn't say , i mean , <EOS> those are sort of agreed but this one would be more five to me . <EOS> will you give four ? <EOS> five ? <EOS> yeah , so maybe if <EOS>
mm . yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i think <EOS> well you could come up with like novelty ones , <EOS> like they've done with the the mobile phones , <EOS> you can get like different you know scenes from different movies and stuff on the remote control <EOS> and sorta stagger the release of them <EOS> and get people like oh i want that cover on it now <EOS> and that'll keep them spending money . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> so anyway we don't have to include this feature because it's it's not used any more by users , <EOS> they prefer to s <EOS> so . <EOS> i am . <EOS> i'm sure that uh it don't like but uh i don't see <EOS> just one button . <EOS>
yeah , yeah . <EOS> it actually is your coffee table . <EOS> make it a piece of furniture . <EOS> yes . yes , there you go . <EOS> or a statue or something . <EOS> okay . well <EOS> we need to finish up here . um <EOS> so for the next so for the next um before the next meeting w uh sh shall we work on <EOS> you're watching trends <EOS> to see what what kind of new information we've got going on . um <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> so <EOS> we would lose this one ? <EOS> yeah , <EOS> but tha that that only is one . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> we could s yeah , a bit . <EOS> no , <EOS> two . <EOS> no , <EOS> one . <EOS>
that's very important . <EOS> um well <EOS> this was because of our last discussion , <EOS> if multiple machines are used , create easy switch between the machines , <EOS> but um it's no longer uh applying . <EOS> well yeah , <EOS> i prefer to use it only for t_v_ <EOS> and um n uh <EOS> not to give too many options <EOS> and and if possible , uh the buttons should give a dr direct action , not first select <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> and the timing was good . <EOS> we never were pushed for time , or sat around doing nothing , so <EOS> i think it's been fine . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . good timing . <EOS> oop <EOS> okay . <EOS> teamwork ? <EOS> i think we worked great as a team . <EOS>
okay , <EOS> so you <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> but mm . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> i dunno . <EOS> it's a bit risky risky . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i think so . <EOS> and maybe it will be quite <EOS> no , <EOS> that's quite inter quite attractive . <EOS>
a bird . <EOS> okay , in the water . <EOS> ah <EOS> i don't know what that is . <EOS> it's a bit <EOS> mm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> it's a bit hard to guess . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> put it colours . <EOS> maybe it would help us . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> there's nothing that would make me spend an extra k few euros on that one rather than another one . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> ju just think , twenty five euros , i mean it's not going to be cheaper . <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> so in that case well it's fine then . <EOS> we can <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
right um , <EOS> time for presentations then . <EOS> who would like to go first ? <EOS> i'll go first . <EOS> sure . <EOS> okay , cool . <EOS> alright um , <EOS> can i st steal this from the back of your laptop ? uh <EOS> oh yeah , of course , yeah . <EOS> g go on ahead . <EOS>
yeah , <EOS> but we don't we don't have any costs now , <EOS> so yeah . <EOS> i don't know how much that's going to uh <EOS> yeah . okay , <EOS> because i uh when you get an l_c_d_ screen , you run it on batteries , <EOS> the batteries will be uh empty very soon , very fast . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> so th that green uh thing is a circuit board , <EOS> and also you can see uh there are b s like uh um access for buttons , <EOS> like when you press a button , the circuit under the button will be activated <EOS> uh th it will <EOS> it will he get some signals from it and it will uh it will ch its ch se send a signal signals to the , yeah , um integrated circuit . <EOS> can you go to the next slide , please . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> what kinda battery would we want to use ? <EOS> because battery changing is usually <EOS> okay . <EOS> d <EOS> double a_ . <EOS> double a_ . <EOS> do some of them use triple a_s though ? <EOS> yeah some use triple a_s . <EOS> so double or triple ? <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> i dunno , i mean <EOS> it sme <EOS> smells good for children . <EOS> we could go comp yeah . <EOS> we could go completely out of the box and make the thing a big red ball foam ball . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> and it's got the thing on the inside . <EOS> and there's no buttons at all , <EOS> it's always on , and just yell at it , and it works . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> but that would be really good if we could do that . <EOS> and other functions for a remote control ? <EOS> maybe we can make it uh uh <EOS> um . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> think it has to be shock proof <EOS> sure , yeah . <EOS>
ye <EOS> double click on it . with the right with the left hand one . <EOS> w <EOS> yeah , yeah . <EOS> i think it's frozen . <EOS> here . don't show me that tip again . <EOS> there we are . <EOS> sorry about this , guys . <EOS> i'm kind of pathetic with things like this . <EOS>
um different fronts , but standard front won't be , yeah . <EOS> see it's <EOS> i think it's okay like this . <EOS> special form , yeah . <EOS> it's hard to say . <EOS> but maybe we have to um <EOS> yeah , okay . <EOS> special colour , you can skip this one , because it's all quite normal . <EOS> we get different ones , that's all . <EOS>
but yeah i mean i guess it's okay . <EOS> i felt like my <EOS> i dunno if it was just my role , <EOS> but l but uh i di i thought that my the information that was available to me was kind of just like <EOS> or maybe it was just the idea that we had . <EOS> but there's kinda <EOS> it was kinda like okay , i don't really think i dunno what i'm doing here . <EOS> so i didn't really think it was helpful . <EOS> so i kind of just made up my own stuff <EOS> and i didn't really like the powerpoint presentations , <EOS> so i kind of wrote a lot of notes instead . <EOS> but yeah i d i don't really like powerpoint personally , think it's kinda stupid . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> because it do doesn't have to flip then . <EOS> because we have en enough space for for making a an l_c_d . <EOS> because here <EOS> yeah . yeah yeah yeah . <EOS> it's better to to have this like this i guess , and then flip it like this . <EOS>
no but i think just one fruit to control everything . <EOS> like a power fruit . <EOS> a power fr a power m a mando , a supermando fruit . <EOS> and uh as well as i could see on the web the scroll button is becoming really uh hot thing s <EOS> and we should have it on the remote . <EOS>
uh-huh . <EOS> okay . <EOS> uh-huh . but our budget , we've <EOS> yeah . <EOS> it's still it's still got to get within our twelve fifty , you know . <EOS> uh-huh . <EOS> okay . <EOS> i'm not sure if the if for twenty five euros uh per uh twelve euros fifty m manufacturing cost , . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> component design . <EOS> so this yeah so this is the described use <EOS> what ? <EOS> it's okay <EOS> are you inst <EOS> uh i think there's something wrong with your <EOS> it did didn't r receive it . didn't receive it . <EOS> maybe you you record it somewhere else . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> okay . <EOS> um so <EOS> i in my personal preferences um i'm hoping that we can ke keep the design as simple and clear as possible . <EOS> this would uh help us uh to upgrade our technology at a future point of time . <EOS> and uh also if we can incorporate uh the latest features in our chip design , so that our um uh remote control does not become outdated soon and it's compatible with mot most uh televisions . <EOS> that's about it . <EOS> so anything that you would like to know or <EOS>
are we just having a radio ? <EOS> on the phone . <EOS> t <EOS> you don't need a light . <EOS> yeah yeah yeah . <EOS> yeah yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> and like if the if the phone's under the couch , you might not see the light , so <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> another thing that you were saying about categorising the controls ? <EOS> um maybe i could suggest we we break them down into three simple categories . <EOS> one would be audio controls , <EOS> one would be video controls , <EOS> and the other one would be a device . <EOS> um this may not map very well to advanced functionality especially , <EOS> but i think that um from a manufacturer's point of view , from a person designing the device , <EOS> but i think from a point of view of a person using the device , you know a t_v_ is something they see and something they hear , <EOS> um it's something they do other things to like turn it on and turn it off . <EOS> i mean like so what we could have is like three buckets , right , where we could throw things into , <EOS> like if we want this feature , let's throw it into there , <EOS> and then from there decide whether it's basic , or it's non-basic . <EOS> i mean it might help with the visualisation . <EOS> and it would actually help with the component build as well . <EOS>
um on , off ? <EOS> uh that would be one of your channels , basically , <EOS> so like channel zero would be t to switch switch the machine off , <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah we turn it off . <EOS> could the middle button of the on-screen menu function as a power button ? <EOS>
yeah <EOS> um yeah so i think we w we go for something mid-sized , <EOS> so something looks good <EOS> and uh is not too prone to get lost . <EOS> so on to y functional requirements or trend watching ? <EOS> i dunno . <EOS> trend watching i guess . <EOS> trend watching i believe . <EOS>
no of course . <EOS> yes . <EOS> what kind of things you'll need inside your thin inside <EOS> w wh what <EOS> yeah <EOS> it's kind of um simple pro progra programmable device , and we have to insert . <EOS> i think we could insert one that could underlie several functions <EOS> of <EOS>
'kay . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> over if you had them close enough , <EOS> that would be one option . <EOS> um the second option th they offer rubber buttons , <EOS> but i thought that an l_c_d_ type of screen <EOS> 'cause one they're incredibly thin um and don't take up much space , <EOS> two they you can have them in a sort of array and you can arrange the buttons on the screen in a sort of set thing and you could have them like a touch <EOS>
i i think it's in the case that it's active . <EOS> it's not uh <EOS> yeah , when you press it . <EOS> so <EOS> yeah , that's right . <EOS> but if you <EOS> i it's it's just uh the the <EOS> two ? <EOS> red's l shows up like something's wrong , <EOS> and green is like it's okay , <EOS> you press the button . <EOS>
yeah , <EOS> but i didn't get a response <EOS> so <EOS> we'll see . <EOS> what if you get a response two or three months from now ? <EOS> that'd be weird . <EOS> okay <EOS> that would be kinda creepy . <EOS> attempts to contact coach ineffective . <EOS>
people want to have a power button . <EOS> channel selection is uh o often used very often used <EOS> and indeed uh very relevant . <EOS> so yeah , <EOS> channel selection is um very important , very often used . <EOS> volume is not often used <EOS> but people uh want to have control on volume <EOS> and that makes sense of course . <EOS> and n then you have things which are very much less often used like the settings . audio settings , screen settings , even teletext and channel settings . <EOS> all of them . they're not often used <EOS> and they are s more or less relevant . <EOS> it seems that people find teletext teletext uh relevant , <EOS> even if i personally never use it <EOS> but seems that it's average relevant at least , so . <EOS>
here the display , and then buttons . <EOS> yeah <EOS> and then we can have a little bit off here and here maybe . <EOS> just that's for left hand and right hand users . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> and then h the rest of the buttons over here . <EOS>
no . res i did not . <EOS> perhaps the rest ? <EOS> no . <EOS> then i think it's a good thing that i made a separate slide of them <EOS> so you can <EOS> ja , <EOS> all read them . <EOS> oh , well not in this presentation . hmm <EOS> .
yes , yes . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yes the buttons are all raised , right ? <EOS> the buttons are all raised <EOS> and if you hold it in the centre of your hand you can even reach it over here so you don't have to turn it around , turn it upside down , move it up , up and down , <EOS> i really like that . <EOS> you really did a good job on that , my little designers . <EOS> um and um <EOS> i like the idea that the on-off button is in a really prominent place . <EOS> that's that's a really good good thing . <EOS>
what's the use uh of the t turbo button already ? <EOS> this is when you when you uh are scrolling the uh through the channels you can tell it to to skip th past channels that you quickly rather th <EOS> ah yeah yeah <EOS> an then you stop when you stop it stops . <EOS>
it could even <EOS> we'll still settle for twenty five . <EOS> that's true , yeah . <EOS> um i suppose these are all that will have to be taken up with a at a different group at i guess . as to a the costs involved . <EOS> maybe . <EOS>
uh . <EOS> which make it uh like new also . <EOS> i think i would give a five . <EOS> it's four . <EOS> four ? <EOS> a four also , <EOS> because , except for the wheel , we don't have so much innovation . <EOS> the rubber is <EOS>
so those four , and of course the main . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> so the first you see the main , <EOS> and the other ones you can uh go to uh <EOS> yeah . yeah . <EOS> like tap screens or something <EOS> or , i dunno . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> well , we'll have this on the screen , on the display . <EOS> y or you could have it so you on the wheel if you <EOS> on the wheel , like if you hold the wheel down then it will mute . <EOS> uh on the l_c_d_ we r you know , the main menu will have various options . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> newsflash ? d did i miss something ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah i received an email so i thought i i can't mail you so i thought i'd just drop it in the folder , but <EOS> yeah pretty much . <EOS> hey what's wrong with my computer ? <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> 'kay . <EOS> okay , so trend watching . <EOS> uh since we do put the fashion in electronics , it is kind of important how our product looks . <EOS> so i guess we can go ahead and go to the next . <EOS> so what they want . <EOS> right now customers want fancy versus functional . <EOS> um basically about fifty eight percent of what they <EOS> like of the product that they want , describing like the in order of how much they want , <EOS> fifty eight per cent of the decision of what it should look like , fancy versus functional , <EOS> and then it has to also be technologically innovative , and yet easy to use . <EOS> so the customer basically is confused . <EOS> they don't know exactly what they want . <EOS> they want us to tell them . <EOS>
off . <EOS> because they've triggered the remote control <EOS> and it's turned off your t_v_ . <EOS> so , i think if we can find a speech recognizer that can handle those types of problems , then yeah , it'd be a really good marketing gimmick . <EOS> but , i think we seriously need to consider how that would impact <EOS>
yes . <EOS> and special material , rubber , wood , yes . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> total seven point six whatever that means . <EOS> uh , i think that's the price . <EOS> that's the price . <EOS> one two three four five six seven eight nine <EOS>
okay . yeah , it's cool . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> though that's a trend . if we want to make it . <EOS> but yeah , <EOS> i'm not a trendwatcher , <EOS> you are . <EOS> so <EOS> uh the t the trend is <EOS> rubber spongy . <EOS>
yeah <EOS> if if you down um . it's just this bit at the bottom which i've highlighted , <EOS> hmm . <EOS> but the scroll wheel requires a mini m minimally a regular chip , <EOS> which is in the higher price range . <EOS> okay . <EOS> the display requires an advanced chip <EOS> the display requires an advanced chip which in turn is more expense . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> and so the th the twenty-five euros that we've identified as the sale price is a wholesale price rather than a retail price . <EOS> that's what we decided here . <EOS> um so what i did is i i decided that that this this needs to be a product in a in a sense can market itself . <EOS> so what we've identified here as our main marketing stratagem is is in design . <EOS> we're making the most beautiful attractive uh whatever we decide it is . <EOS> so that means we have about seven more minutes or ten minutes left . <EOS> um so i would like to have a product that that we can sell easily . <EOS> so i say inspiration , <EOS> so having something beauty , something attractive , uh something that in a sense will sell itself . <EOS> uh innovation i think fits into what we're talking about here with design . <EOS> uh cutting edge technology , i don't think we're gonna have that , <EOS> these were ideas i was putting together , <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> okay . <EOS> um there's a scroll wheel which is you know the new mouse has just got like the centre section which you can scroll up and down , <EOS> which may be for the volume . <EOS> you could do do that . <EOS> um one issue for the buttons is , depending on which material we use , <EOS> if we use rubber buttons then it requires a rubber case , <EOS> so we have to take that into consideration . <EOS> um moving on to the printed s <EOS>
it needs to be able <EOS> y y have to be able to find it . <EOS> because one of the biggest problems with remote controls is finding them . <EOS> so uh , <EOS> i also , <EOS> since we have to establish our corporate image on the basis of this new product , <EOS> thought we better look at things that are popular <EOS> and um ex go beyond those , <EOS> and , as i said in the first meeting , <EOS> um and then uh we might wanna talk eventually about the materials that are appropriate to use in uh in the construction , especially in the the uh the outside of the product <EOS> so that it gives the appearance , <EOS> and it is reliable , and so forth . <EOS>
wrote nearly a page , <EOS> but not . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> got notes and doodles . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i'm not quite sure what the advantage for us using a digital pen might be . <EOS> i think tracking . <EOS> well <EOS> i think this is a i think the digital pen's mostly for the benefit of the uh <EOS>
yeah , i know what you meant , yeah . <EOS> well just a li i can't des like condom thingy , like a a cover . <EOS> but well the question is , which one's easiest to change <EOS> and we can just contact our relevant department for that , <EOS> and just see what the cost is for covering that or covering that , <EOS> and for now we can do two prototypes maybe <EOS> and then hi try and ask users what the best is , <EOS> and <EOS>
our findings , lots of findings , <EOS> i've just summarised some of them here . <EOS> the overall thing which i've i've got at the top there in italics is that users dislike the look and feel of current remote controls , <EOS> so it has obvious design implications there . <EOS> um , we found that seventy five percent of users find most remote controls ugly . <EOS> eighty percent would spend more money when a remote control would look fancy , <EOS> we were quite surprised by that finding , <EOS> but um that's quite a high proportion of our our , you know , international target group are prepared to spend more money for something that's a bit nicer looking . <EOS> um , current remote controls do not match well with the operating behaviour of the user overall . <EOS> for example , you can see below there , seventy five percent of users zap a lot , <EOS> so you've got your person sunk back in the sofa channel-hopping . <EOS> so again there's power implications there . <EOS>
hmm . <EOS> we could have like an adam and eve type commercial , and that's the fig-leaf . <EOS> mm . that'll sell . <EOS> oh right . <EOS> and so the serpent says , use our remote . <EOS> there you go , marketing . <EOS> let you loose . <EOS>
hm . <EOS> you could also make line with uh <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so that's <EOS> yeah . two hours further . <EOS> thickness . oh . <EOS> so that's blue . <EOS> oh . wh why not go for the twenty ? <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
and there's no way you can represent it on here . y <EOS> yeah , right . <EOS> that was <EOS> 'kay . <EOS> and we discussed that being included . <EOS> yeah , so . <EOS> then yes , <EOS> then i would <EOS> well it isn't <EOS> what else would it need for it to be technologically innovative ? <EOS>
would the the idea something along the lines of , one on button would turn on say the video recorder , the t_v_ , maybe the sound system as well , all in one go , is that kind of <EOS> for instance , <EOS> um let's say oh oh um , or um you know <EOS> you pr uh you press uh say the play button for the d_v_d_ player and it turns the t_v_ on and onto the right channel as well , um <EOS>
okay . <EOS> yeah , okay , mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm , <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> now we have included another feature that is the mute button <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> on the side of the model . <EOS> then we have included one to nine buttons <EOS>
your evaluation . <EOS> oh , yeah . <EOS> this is where we all get to <EOS> i get to write on the , oops , on the board . <EOS> right . <EOS> oh . <EOS> 's function <EOS> f_ eight . <EOS> okay . <EOS> i love the smell of that play-doh . <EOS>
yeah , okay . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> i've i've got something of that uh too . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> for volume . for volume , or a channel . <EOS> yeah , why not . <EOS> for volume ? <EOS> well <EOS> then we can even simplify it more . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> so there's a project i think called x_ house or something like that that does that , uh you can integrate your remote with uh computers stuff . <EOS> so <EOS> there is one that is one thing . <EOS> the other is the <EOS>
it's all automatic . <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay yeah it's fine . <EOS> w we are living in a wonderful world . <EOS> yep . <EOS> very good uh yeah <EOS> you th <EOS> yeah . <EOS> bananas everywhere . <EOS> okay , so <EOS> uh . <EOS> automatically configure . <EOS>
we could make a hello kitty <EOS> themed remote . <EOS> i think one in b bright colours would be good . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> we could totally go for the japan-a-mation . <EOS> well <EOS> i mean there's also the cachet that um uh the japanese make great products . <EOS> electrical <EOS> their industrial design is very good . <EOS>
yes . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> this is the orange button , the microphone . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> an <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> crazy dis designer , <EOS> okay . <EOS> to this cover you know . <EOS> design enter . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> well , <EOS> not everybody has uh has uh a p_c_ at home . <EOS> well <EOS> the most most people have , <EOS> but not not everybody <EOS> and <EOS> well , <EOS> at <EOS> uh you can go back to the shop <EOS> and uh they <EOS>
uh the profit we must make with uh the new remote is uh fifty million euro . <EOS> so that's a lot . <EOS> we have to sell uh a lot of uh <EOS> yeah , <EOS> how much is it ? <EOS> hundred million uh remotes or something ? <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> oh okay , <EOS> i i was the only one who get it . <EOS> okay <EOS> it was uh uh uh um um a report about uh an experiment with uh a lot of users . <EOS> and uh they had a lot of findings in their report uh with statistical uh uh uh thing uh with statistical uh proof . <EOS> so <EOS> i um i had three pages with findings and sev a lot of uh a lot of findings . <EOS> so we can use this uh to uh create our own remote control . <EOS> uh seventy five percent of the users find uh most remote controls ugly . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> i think uh uh that's a lot , <EOS> so we have to make a beautiful remote control . <EOS> uh eighty percent of users would spend when uh a remote control will l uh look fancy . <EOS> i think this fits uh at the uh what what uh michael said about uh older people . <EOS> older people will uh spend more money uh for uh something uh uh what's good . <EOS> because younger people are more critical uh about uh uh where they spend their money money at . <EOS> uh seventy five percent uh seventy five percent of the users say they zap a lot . <EOS> well <EOS> okay , that's uh normal . <EOS> i think uh we we have to make uh good zap buttons . <EOS> but that's one of our requirements . <EOS>
mm-hmm , it's about that . <EOS> and that's quite a lot for a remote control . <EOS> yeah , yeah . <EOS> mm . <EOS> um well <EOS> my first thoughts would be most remote controls are grey or black . <EOS> as you said they come with the t_v_ <EOS> so it's normally just your basic grey black remote control functions , <EOS> so maybe we could think about colour ? <EOS> make <EOS> that might make it a bit different from the rest at least . <EOS> um , and as you say , we need to have some kind of gimmick , <EOS> so um i thought maybe something like if you lose it and you can whistle , <EOS> you know those things ? <EOS>
yeah of course . <EOS> well this is clay . <EOS> yeah it's kinda cool . <EOS> you have to reach a little bit don't you . <EOS> yeah the the power button is a bit of a reach , <EOS> but i think we might scale down the final model a bit . <EOS> these this is a bit larger than it would be , but <EOS>
uh-huh . <EOS> any other thoughts about um th the physical appearance of a of remote controls ? <EOS> i think something that's comfortable to hold <EOS> because sometimes you get the remote controls that are just those big , rectangular things <EOS> and uh they're kind of awkward to hold onto , <EOS> so something that's more comfortable <EOS> that fits in a person's hand better . <EOS>
yep . <EOS> yes . <EOS> so , we are going to have a meeting about the functional design . <EOS> um so first before starting i w just going to uh to go quickly to through the minutes of previous meeting . <EOS> so uh basically we we are not decided if w we should go for a universal or specific uh uh remote control , <EOS> but i have new um new i inputs for about that topics . <EOS> i goin i'm going to share with you . <EOS> and uh basically we decided to um to uh go to individual actions for each of you <EOS> uh so um industrial designer should wor was supposed to work on th on th on the working design . <EOS> you showed us <EOS> you ar you you prepare something for us ? <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm . <EOS> and make that a fashion symbol as well . <EOS> well <EOS> n <EOS> well , <EOS> th this is this is the whole point , <EOS> yes , <EOS> you know , <EOS> i'm <EOS> i've got a a real reaction uh remote control to go with my real reaction coffee maker or or whatever . <EOS> and uh then people , you know , people demand more real reaction stuff . <EOS>
yeah , i would assume so . <EOS> i think we're supposed to know it as remote control experts . <EOS> but also s so the channel , the volume and the power buttons are the most important <EOS> on our company website you can find like the specific statistics concerning to how much each button is used , <EOS> but those are the definitely the top ones . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> uh in one time i dunno , that's not really my department . <EOS> that's more your uh your department to to uh to <EOS> and do we need a a logo on our uh remote control , or <EOS> yeah . <EOS> but it should be if the screen is here then the logo should be like on on top , <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i mean it's uh <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> we're good , <EOS> and if they're not we're going to uh re-design , <EOS> but we have to do that uh very very quick i think , <EOS> yes . <EOS> um i don't know if i <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so we're going to erase features or something . <EOS> do you have the cost <EOS> or uh <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> so we we'll put some extras , if there is something . <EOS> yeah maybe . <EOS> we'll see later . <EOS> okay so in for the case um <EOS> mm . <EOS> i put single curved . <EOS> okay . <EOS> to reduce the cost , it's okay . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> now our third <EOS> go danny , go danny . <EOS> team member with his presentation . <EOS> okay , <EOS> i'm going to tell you something about a trend watching . the trends from the past years , what the people like , what the youngsters like , what the elderly people liked about shapes , colours , material and stuff . <EOS> 'kay . <EOS> the method i used was <EOS> like i told i watched the trends from the past years about colours , shapes , material they wanted uh from elderly and young people . <EOS> so we can keep that in mind for designing f uh the device itself . <EOS> findings i made . <EOS> the most important thing people liked last year was that the remote control should be look look fancy . <EOS> the second important thing that w should be if inv in innov innovative , <EOS> okay , <EOS> like the l_c_d_ screen that's quite innovative <EOS> so that should be great meeting for this . <EOS> and the third thing is it should be easy to use . <EOS> i think with only one menu , four button , channel , volume , it should also be enough for easy to use . <EOS> the personal preferences for the young people , they liked fruity colours like uh banana yellow , uh strawberry red and stuff . <EOS>
um we still have time if there's any other input . <EOS> i mean the <EOS> i think we did really well personally , <EOS> which is why we've <EOS> you know , gone through this so quickly . <EOS> 'cause i mean we've all we all kind of agreed our product is satisfactory , it fits the budget , and it's trendy . <EOS> so . <EOS>
okay , no <EOS> it's two ? <EOS> true is a one . <EOS> very true , is it very true <EOS> or isn't that true ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> well <EOS> i'd say two on a scale <EOS> well <EOS> they think it's very true , <EOS> but uh <EOS>
okay , yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yep . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> same i believe . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> uh and what did the marketing expert do ? <EOS> uh well <EOS> from a marketing uh perspective , um well the function des design phase uh consists out of the user requirements . <EOS> um what needs and desires are to be fulfilled ? <EOS> so <EOS> there are a few means to reach that um by by doing research uh to see what existing products are there out in the market . <EOS> i mean , what functions do they have . <EOS> um especially what are their shortcomings ? <EOS> are there any new functions uh which can be added to our product ? <EOS>
yeah i think so . <EOS> yeah . just there . <EOS> okay . <EOS> mm . are we um should that thing be on the thing to put the you s <EOS> you talking about a home for it . <EOS> do you still want to build a little thing next to the telly or to p hang on the wall <EOS> or shall we leave that for now ? <EOS>
hmm . <EOS> lost . <EOS> s <EOS> it's okay . <EOS> it's very important . <EOS> yes , it is important for the remote control world . <EOS> wait , <EOS> is that like your <EOS> ergonomics like your hand movements or something ? <EOS> sh <EOS> could be , yeah . <EOS>
well , <EOS> maybe you can look at uh mobile phones . <EOS> oh . <EOS> oh , <EOS> you just <EOS> i dunno what happened . <EOS> who ? <EOS> yeah , we have to look at mobile phones , that's right . <EOS> just <EOS> they they're uh designed very well . <EOS> and well basically are the same , just a bit smaller . <EOS> you think you can't make a t_v_ controller too small , 'cause then you will always lo always lose it . <EOS>
can you just fill it in in the yellow boxes ? or <EOS> oh , okay yeah , okay , <EOS> let's see . <EOS> okay , one , okay . <EOS> oh go away . <EOS> um kinetic source so that's in the energy source that's all we need . <EOS> uh electronics , simple chip on print ? <EOS> is that's what we're using ? <EOS> one of those ? <EOS>
w what abou what about the the the cafeteria ? <EOS> i mean , we are going to purchase a cafeteria with a projector and all this altogether or <EOS> reading room , yeah . <EOS> it's altogether . <EOS> well , but that's <EOS> uh it's a reading room . <EOS> reading room , it's not a cafeteria . <EOS>
oh , that's interesting . <EOS> you could f we could do a kind of fruit collection of electronics things . electronic device . <EOS> device devi <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , but just don't trust too much the trends . <EOS> 'cause fruit and vegetables it won't last for ten years uh . <EOS> maybe two years it's dead . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> s scrolling through and selecting a few . <EOS> right . <EOS> so one ? <EOS> yeah ? <EOS> so that's a one . <EOS> i think that's a one . <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay <EOS> um the fourth one . <EOS> how about the problem of a remote being easily lost ? <EOS> one of the number one complaints . <EOS>
yeah um . <EOS> i agree with having too many remotes around . <EOS> my dad has a whole drawer at home of remotes for various things , <EOS> and i don't know how to work half of them um . <EOS> what's important for me , i guess , is that it's easy to use <EOS> and that there's not too many buttons , <EOS> they are not too small , <EOS> you know you know you need to n to know what you're doing . <EOS> and one thing i particularly like is if you are not um sort of moving it around to get it to work with the infra-red . <EOS> um , i think there is a way around that , <EOS> but i know in my residence right now the the television you sort of have to walk all around the room to get it to turn on , <EOS> so i it's just simpler just to just turn around the t_v_ itself , <EOS> and i think that's if we're gonna make a remote control , it should actually work for what it's doing . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> okay . <EOS> yep <EOS> so that would be about a centimetre for a button , <EOS> so one two three four centimetres . <EOS> plus maybe half o five <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> about nine in total . <EOS> six seven eight , <EOS> about yeah nine total . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> tuner , would that have up and down ? . <EOS> um up tune one way , tune the o <EOS> i i dunno i dunno possibly . <EOS> i think they normally do . <EOS> okay . okay . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> and then maybe sort of an enter button for sort of s you know , saying that you want that particular thing tuned in . <EOS> so you go up and down and then it pick it finds something and then you wanna press enter to select it , yeah . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> like on the side of it . <EOS> oh if it's just up and down . <EOS> well , if it's just up and down <EOS> but is that for <EOS> which ? <EOS> volume or channel . <EOS> i don't know . <EOS> well , you could do some on both sides . <EOS>
yeah . no , yeah . <EOS> yeah i'm just thinking , if we i we wanna make something different <EOS> right ? <EOS> so the with the scroll is is more futuristic than the standard arrow buttons . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i think . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah you are going to design it so <EOS>
yep , yeah . <EOS> yes . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah , it's like you know yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah , a little elderly , a little arthritic hand you know , <EOS> and and it's a small button and and it they don't press it exactly <EOS> you know something else happens n not their favourite channel comes up but something else <EOS> and they're very frustrated you know . <EOS>
yeah , yeah , <EOS> i suppose nearer to you <EOS> but a b like if you have surround sound then <EOS> mm <EOS> yeah and it might become very difficult from a distance for the television to understand what you're saying because of the noise factor for the remote control <EOS> being cl i mean it'll it'll mm . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> mm-hmm . 'kay . <EOS> i think they all work on the same prin principle as well <EOS> sorta like <EOS> i don't actually know . <EOS> but is it just infra-red ? <EOS> is that standard ? <EOS> mm . <EOS> i i think yeah , yeah , r universal remote . <EOS>
yeah , that's very good 'cause the highest we coulda got is one . <EOS> i got <EOS> alright . <EOS> does that seem right then ? <EOS> yeah , 'cause we've a four to bring down . <EOS> okay . <EOS> mm . <EOS> uh , aye . <EOS> it seems like it should be more around two . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> mm . yes . <EOS> maybe , maybe . <EOS> okay , so the available things are l_c_d_ , the buttons and everything . <EOS> uh radio frequency depends . <EOS> and , well the recognition it depends on you guys . <EOS> you should probably speak . <EOS>
it could be like this . <EOS> yes . <EOS> i'd , well uh <EOS> this one is really comfortable , <EOS> like i like the sides whatever , <EOS> because <EOS> are you gonna lose it easier ? <EOS> but if we have the um , the locator , then we don't have to worry about that . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> so <EOS> i see all everybody's here , <EOS> 'kay . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yep . <EOS> and we can start meeting . <EOS> okay . <EOS> what's the agenda for this meeting ? <EOS> the <EOS> i will uh present here agenda with with with with slides
sure . <EOS> i'll start off then . <EOS> okay . <EOS> good luck . <EOS> doh . <EOS> 'kay <EOS> i'm uh gonna inform you about the trend-watching i've done over the past few days . <EOS> um we've done some market research . <EOS> we distributed some more enquetes , questionnaires . <EOS> and um besides that um i deployed some trend-watchers to milan and paris to well get all of the newest trends . <EOS> and i've consulted some additional trend-watch trend-watchers , after the original trend-watchers return , about what the the best design would be . <EOS> um okay <EOS> these are some overall findings . <EOS> um most important thing is the fancy design . <EOS> um the research indicated that that was by far the most important factor . <EOS> um innovativeness was about half as important as the fancy design . <EOS> by innovativeness this means um functions which are not featured in other remote controls . <EOS> um about half of , half as important as the innovativeness was the was easy to use . <EOS> um for our um group , we're focusing on the people of sixty to eighty y years old , this is um , these factors are slightly more equal . <EOS> 'kay <EOS> these are some more group specific findings . <EOS> uh the older people prefer dark colours . <EOS> uh they like recognisable shapes , and familiar material . <EOS> and our surveys have indicated that especially wood is pretty much the material for older people . <EOS> um this is , this image will give you a little bit of an impression about um the look-and-feel that um the remote should have . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> i think we will save money with that . <EOS> yeah , okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> are you almost finished <EOS> or just <EOS> yeah , <EOS> the the personal preference , i didn't fill it out . <EOS> because i was short on time . <EOS> but um <EOS>
mm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah , that'll probably be good . <EOS> and we want um we want large buttons for the essential things . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> large , accessible buttons for the essentials . <EOS> we want a possibility to um to get um a possibility to get the extra functions . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah , that's a good idea . <EOS> more complicated ones , <EOS> but 's all still in one . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> i think that's a good idea , yeah . <EOS> okay um , so <EOS> what are we emphasising ? i what in this project ? <EOS>
yeah , that's true . <EOS> and also remember that in this day in age we need , you know , like a hundred button , too . <EOS> i used to have a remote that did not even go up past like fifty . <EOS> so i couldn't whenever i got cable , i had to get a new t_v_ . <EOS>
um i think the thing was that if you decide to do this , to have triangular buttons , um somebody might look at this one and say oh well this triangular button is pointing up , <EOS> and that's the first thing that they see <EOS> actually that can't be right , can it ? <EOS> oh well , no , <EOS>
i'd say three , <EOS> i mean my remote control is kinda at home is pretty terrible . <EOS> if it was change my remote control of my d_v_d_ player for a mando banana then i would be more inclined to <EOS> but uh 'cause it's really bad but uh <EOS> i'd say a three . <EOS>
i'm a okay . <EOS> yeah . yeah . <EOS> i mean the main uh function of remote control is to have something in the hand <EOS> and we should be very careful about the size of the remote control . <EOS> if we are going to add a speech interface , i'm not sure with trendy slim size of the remote control it would be able to put a speech recog <EOS> if you want to put a speech recognition system f interface for that i think the t_v_ itself could have it . <EOS>
oh yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> um 'cause uh you know audio settings , nought point eight percent . <EOS> i mean if they weren't there , <EOS> mm-mm . <EOS> would people miss them ? <EOS> but look at the importance of them . the volume settings . <EOS>
i think . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i must finish off now , <EOS> so it's over . <EOS> you uh will receive specific specific instructions uh by your personal coach . <EOS> and i see you in uh thirty minutes . <EOS> thank you . <EOS> okay , <EOS> cheers . <EOS>
so like maybe that's just too big <EOS> because <EOS> well see th the reason the broccoli works is you can kinda hold it like that , <EOS> which is a nice kind of <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah it's sorta like a joystick . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> but <EOS>
yeah , yeah . <EOS> so i guess we have to look into the , um , like , the programming , how this how they actually programme these things , and if that's <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mean <EOS> oh how they make the menu show up on the t_v_ ? <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> and this has in-built voice recogniser . <EOS> can you go on to the next slide ? <EOS> yeah , now this is an interface for a chil uh for a remote uh uh which a child can use . <EOS> uh this is user-friendly , it's very attractive <EOS> and uh children can use it as well as they can play with it . <EOS> and this comes with different colours , different shapes . <EOS>
but if you uh if you hold the ma the remote like this , if you put it on the top on the side <EOS> i dunno . should be able to work . <EOS> never mind . <EOS> yeah okay . <EOS> yeah . . <EOS> depends on the sensitivity of the microphone , but i think that's okay . <EOS>
what do you mean by the pa pa processing will be done on the t_v_ <EOS> yeah , all the processing is done the t_v_ is a compu has some processing power the <EOS> than the <EOS> so we have to t <EOS> so we should have specific t_v_ ? <EOS> or ? we can use this . <EOS>
it works . <EOS> can you go to the next slide , please . <EOS> yeah , i have few pictures . <EOS> when you look at the uh um remote controller uh it's it's it <EOS> this is a normal remote controller . <EOS> and to the next slide , please . <EOS>
mm 'kay . <EOS> thanks guys . <EOS> okay . <EOS> thanks . <EOS> so <EOS> we are done for now . . <EOS>
yeah , yeah i think that's definitely a good idea . <EOS> uh-huh . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm . <EOS> um just about the three buckets , um what would go in the the device functions one ? <EOS> um things like on off . <EOS> because they don't have anything to do with what you see . <EOS> i me mean in terms of picture and the entertainment value , <EOS> you know , um so um <EOS> and channel . <EOS> because the on off also goes , you know , like on off like power , not on off sound . <EOS> not on off video . <EOS> although you don't turn off the video on your t_v_ , <EOS> but um you might wanna you know turn off the sound , <EOS> say you wanna pick up the phone , <EOS> there's a mute button , right , <EOS> so you you have you have a choice of putting it on to um others or a device . <EOS> device is basically anything which we can't categorise , right . <EOS> we put it out . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> and then , and then the other thing would basically be sh shape or practicality of use . <EOS> yep <EOS> uh well i think that everybody's gonna say their remote control is practical . <EOS> i think we have to , we have to dwell on on on the appearance . <EOS> we're really gonna have the be the <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> and we can put all the options into this screen . <EOS> we'll need only few buttons . <EOS> all the other things can be controlled through the screen . <EOS> and all these buttons should be easy to find and to click , <EOS> 'cause when you watch a movie and you want to change something , you always try to find a good button and click it , <EOS> but you should do it by touching it <EOS> and finding it easily just by touch . <EOS> so <EOS> press <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> but as soon as you speak about options , it means that the price increases , <EOS> and we don't really want the price to be too too high , <EOS> because we wanna be able to produce it . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> remember it's twelve euros . <EOS>
um . <EOS> yep . <EOS> for the case itself , one colour . it's one special colour . <EOS> just one colour , okay . <EOS> 'cause the case unit itself , the rest of our components go on top of it . <EOS> okay <EOS> so interface-wise , is it this third option we have , the two of them there ? <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yes . <EOS> yeah you're sitting there already or maybe you have no other uh <EOS> yeah , and then you can just see your remote controller yeah yeah yeah so <EOS> yes . <EOS> yeah , and a lot of time there's not a clock on the screen , and you have to go somewhere but you just wanna look at the news for a minute . <EOS> yeah that's that's good , the clock is good . <EOS> okay . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> it's just , the way i figure it , twelve point five euros per unit , we have to sell at least like three million or something like that , <EOS> not to account for all the the money we waste on remotes that no one buys , <EOS> you know , like <EOS> if we made a perf if we made a ks for every remote we made someone bought it , then we have to sell a lot of remote controls . <EOS> we just <EOS>
yes . <EOS> and and therefore uh won't get damaged too easily . <EOS> um we're looking for a device that is uh <EOS> what was the other things you said there ? <EOS> um sort of easy to use so the buttons are accessible . <EOS> easy to use . <EOS> use . <EOS>
it doesn't has to say anything . <EOS> just you have to just talk to <EOS> no . <EOS> does it say does it say something back ? <EOS> yeah uh <EOS> th that's just it's a <EOS> no . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> it <EOS> well <EOS> that's integrated in the chip , <EOS> so if you use the speech recognition , that's in it . <EOS>
no no no , <EOS> because we we discussed that you could charge it , <EOS> otherwise is it it jumps to stand-by mode automatically . <EOS> yeah <EOS> but <EOS> but not for the remote but for the t_v_ , <EOS> that you use <EOS> yeah , <EOS> but a t_v_ of course , th that's the i think that's a best thing is that to implement that one in the menu with the volume and channel . <EOS> no . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah , actually <EOS> if you've got a lot of channels , the number keypad can be quite annoying as well , <EOS> becau it's <EOS> you know <EOS> if you're trying to remember what uh , you know , what number's the discovery channel or whatever . it's just irritating . <EOS> but if you h but but but if you have a me but if you have a menu structure , then you can sub-group them . <EOS>
can you look into the company logo ? <EOS> um , things that are associated with the company in view to trying to incorporate that into the design of the product . <EOS> i mean current . <EOS> for example , if it was a c_ or something like that , you could have it in a vague c_ shape that opens up kind of like a shell , or something , um something along those lines to be able to incorporate it quite
it makes it twelve , yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> s <EOS> indeed . okay . <EOS> well , <EOS> not really <EOS> and <EOS> and there are some models that don't uh accommodate that function . <EOS> so <EOS> d uh wh <EOS> the philip's television makes it possible in that indeed to uh press one and then two to make uh the uh tj to reach channel twelve . <EOS> but uh all the television makes uh use of those button where you first press that button and then press two digits to uh to get <EOS>
sure . <EOS> ah right . <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> sure b <EOS> y yeah . <EOS> but yeah , i mean it doesn't have to be that , you know <EOS> th that was my main point , <EOS> we don't have to use metal , <EOS> i don't know if using plastic does make it cheaper , <EOS> i presume it would . <EOS> yeah , yeah , yeah . <EOS>
'kay . <EOS> yeah , same here . <EOS> we could draw animals on the board again . <EOS> mm uh no . <EOS> mm uh no . <EOS> i don't think so . <EOS> you can make some animals . <EOS> oh , you don't like anim <EOS> i don't like play-doh , no . <EOS> it's just minging . <EOS> it smells so bad . <EOS>
sure , sure , yes . <EOS> disposable diapers is an example of that in fact . <EOS> yes , <EOS> it is one of the first consumer products that was launched about thirty years that was a disposable consumer product , <EOS> and uh people <EOS> the market hadn't really gotten on to the concept that you could use something and then throw it away , 'cause it wasn't uh <EOS> but then when they re-launched them thirty years later , they were virtually the same design , <EOS> but people had gotten the throw-away , you know , paper cups and napki y all kinds of things that they hadn't um <EOS> so , you're right , timing is very important , <EOS> but i think we've got a good product . <EOS>
yeah , more . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> well , <EOS> i'll i'll get back on it . <EOS> okay . <EOS> uh the third one is the aspect of the remote control should be easy to use . <EOS> but uh that was an overall uh point . <EOS> we already discussed that . <EOS> um i've got one picture . <EOS> uh d our our target group uh we thought about was young and trendy . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> so the speech recognition was <EOS> are we going for speech recognition ? <EOS> no ? <EOS> 'cause that required the advanced <EOS> yeah . <EOS> um i think it would be helpful to find it , <EOS> but i don't think it'd um <EOS>
and then it that basically <EOS> well , what about this what about if you can programme in your favourite channels into this scroll wheel and you can just like roll through your favourite channels , <EOS> and it c it <EOS> mm . <EOS> well that's quite cool . <EOS> you'd need a display on the th the thing . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so that's uh that close your investigations ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> uh yeah i think so . <EOS> not so far . <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> maybe we can have a look at the user requirements with <EOS>
expert <EOS> don't play yourself down . <EOS> expert <EOS> i'm ron . <EOS> i uh once upon a time studied in victoria <EOS> and i am the user interface designer . <EOS> i'm nathan , <EOS> i'm from california , <EOS> and i'm here doing a masters degree in social anthropology . <EOS>
okay . uh well <EOS> the sub-component , i suppose that you understand what a sub-component is , is f in this example it's the button . <EOS> uh when it is pressed down , um , the switch is ter is uh is switched on , <EOS> so with uh the wire is sent to the to the chip in uh co-operation with the battery of course , <EOS> because to make uh a a signal possible you have to have some sort of uh <EOS>
no no , <EOS> th all <EOS> that's why we have all these numbers . <EOS> these numbers um <EOS> these numbers all work independently up to nine . <EOS> yeah <EOS> but i mean if you press , it'll go to that channel right away . <EOS> 'cause you gotta press the plus afterwards . <EOS>
yeah yeah , <EOS> but it's an animal it's an animal that lives in the water . <EOS> so i first uh draw the water . <EOS> okay . <EOS> the water is important . <EOS> uh . okay , <EOS> and now <EOS> i make the animal . <EOS> it's a fish . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> to be replaced with a <EOS> regular chip . <EOS> regular chip . <EOS> yep . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> okay . <EOS> so what that means is that um <EOS> and so we've got point three to get rid of . <EOS> um and we ha <EOS> where are the four the four push buttons are where exactly now ? <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> and do you think it's . <EOS> yep . <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> jo's making faces at me . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so . <EOS> matthew is uh late again . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> probably an important man . <EOS> um . so well <EOS> it is important for him to be here uh . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> mm-hmm . okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> but twenty six percent , do you know <EOS> so , <EOS> it seems that it's a lot of people for a concept that we don't know <EOS> but we have to take this into account . <EOS> or something we don't know . mm-hmm . <EOS>
uh . <EOS> yeah i think that's the better one , <EOS> because <EOS> yeah i i understand . <EOS> and the b_b_c_ . <EOS> i think if you you're going to target a lot of people and the whole world and only britain then i think the cost will uh rise higher than the twelve fifty , i think . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> feature <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i i agree with uh this uh <EOS> yeah . <EOS> now we have to decide on what kind of fanciness . <EOS> do we take titanium smelling like fruit , <EOS> or do we make spongy
