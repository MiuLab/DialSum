okay . um . <EOS> so we need to make some decisions on the remote control functions . <EOS> um , yeah . do let's <EOS> i guess we should yeah make some <EOS> kind of brainstorming , <EOS> see what we can <EOS> like in terms of <EOS> how it looks or <EOS>
okay . <EOS> okay , that's fine , that's good . <EOS> okay , let's start from the beginning . <EOS> so i'm going to speak about technical functions design <EOS> uh just like some some first issues that came up . <EOS> um 'kay , <EOS> so the method i was um adopting at this point , it's not um for the for the whole um period of the um all the project but it's just at th at this very moment . <EOS> um <EOS> uh my method was um to look at um other um remote controls , <EOS> uh so mostly just by searching on the web <EOS> and to see what um functionality they used . <EOS> and then um after having got this inspiration and having compared what i found on the web um just to think about what the de what the user really needs and what um what the user might desire as additional uh functionalities . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> 'kay . <EOS> right . <EOS> which i think it probably should be , <EOS> even if it's a physical , you know , a f a like a f a physical switch or a physical cover for the remote , even something like that , um then yes , <EOS> it's like , you know , like s you said earlier on ab ab ab a flip thing , something like that , <EOS> but you know being physical . <EOS> look into . <EOS>
okay , <EOS> what uh <EOS> there's one more decisi uh one more solution in fact , um <EOS> 'cause there are some some paints that can change colour according to where they are , <EOS> like they can reflect different colours lights , yeah . <EOS> mm . <EOS> and thermodynamic also . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> so , <EOS> but uh le let's decide first about the components concept and uh interface concept , okay , <EOS> if is acceptable for both of you , what uh ed was talking . <EOS> and your design whether you want with the display or without display or just a simple , so <EOS>
spongy . <EOS> mm . <EOS> oh wow . <EOS> this one was cooler . <EOS> i got a whole table and everything . <EOS> now i have all about circuits and chips and transponders <EOS> and <EOS> i wrote it all down , <EOS> because i thought it would be relevant , like all the different parts of the inside of a remote control , <EOS> but then they're like , you don't actually need this <EOS> you just need to talk about the case . <EOS>
no . <EOS> uh strange that i received the information about that . <EOS> oh <EOS> that's hard . <EOS> but <EOS> so <EOS> uh the ma the main points i i i uh just said . we have to be original and uh technological innovative . <EOS> becau <EOS> yeah . <EOS> but <EOS>
um , what we need to discuss now is the finance of it , um <EOS> i got me you've got <EOS> you provided a number <EOS> that actually sounds quite nice . <EOS> um the trouble is i was just given this by finance . <EOS> um , it's a spreadsheet of the parts <EOS> and i've just tentatively put in what it's going to look like um . <EOS> i'm just gonna clear this out real quickly , <EOS> but it looks like <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> because it it would also be interesting to uh you to know find out if we have a market in really young children as well , to see you know how to how to market this thing . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
um so now we are going to to get used t to to the tools we are going to use all during all this project . <EOS> so we can try to use uh the whiteboard here . <EOS> so uh . <EOS> for example we can try to write what is our our favourite animal and write the f our favourite characteristics about it . <EOS>
ah well , <EOS> maybe from now on real reaction should give us more money . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> oh , i did learn something new , play-doh is useful . <EOS> no it is it is . <EOS> it is useful and in in in in in in in um conceptualizing , in being creative . <EOS> 'cause like you say , it's something you can put your hands on and feel and touch and get a sense for . <EOS> like we were playing with the play-doh and the ideas came with the play-doh rather than with everything else . <EOS> you might wanna write that down . <EOS> it's just , i'm just fiddling with the play-doh , and i'm going yeah yeah it's kinda cool . <EOS>
uh <EOS> yeah , <EOS> that's a good idea . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> i suppose i sup <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> if we we're <EOS> i mean <EOS> i'm getting a clear message that we think that we should have those facilities available . <EOS> so i guess we could have a menu button as well . <EOS> we could have the channels and the power and then a menu button and then the volume . <EOS> so have four buttons and the volume instead of three buttons and the volume . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> hmm , that's interesting . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> uh yeah uh the product can be de delivered into different cases . <EOS> uh usually , the cases and card flat that w we see usually uh d uh a normal remote controller . <EOS> um . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> red , white , blue , black . <EOS> rasta colours . <EOS> and a see-through uh <EOS> grey . <EOS> yeah sea view , yes , simpson's versions and <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> see through version . yeah . <EOS> if you press a button , it turns green . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> unsupportive ? <EOS> i think the whiteboard , for me , is the kind of thing i would use all the time , <EOS> but it's um not quite as useful as to us as it could have been , <EOS> maybe just in the way that we we use it , in the sense that once we have an idea out there or while work was going on in between meetings , that could have been up on a board uh you know as opposed to in like in text . <EOS>
yeah yeah <EOS> we can have the same global shape <EOS> and then uh add on skins and with with this uh tex spongy texture uh things like that . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah that's right . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah you can pl <EOS> in what material would that be in uh ? <EOS>
and <EOS> and um , you know to give you kind of the idea of a banana but without it looking you know completely kitsch . for better want of a better word <EOS> you know ? <EOS> you think that yellow it's kitsch . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> well , you know , i don i don't know how many peop <EOS>
right . <EOS> yep . <EOS> 'kay . <EOS> yep . <EOS> i'm sure we'll be busy . <EOS> mm 'kay um <EOS> i'll type up mi minutes <EOS> and probably email those out to all of you . um just including all the things that we talked about . um . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so we didn't and we don't have to do all uh to be too complicated about that . <EOS> uh the energy source is connected to the infrared button , <EOS> but uh the infrared button uh works only via the chip and the subcomponent to uh the switch <EOS> there is a switch uh between these . <EOS> when the switch is pressed in a w on this <EOS> this case it switches a button , <EOS> when a button is prush pushed in , uh a electric current goes through here , <EOS> and in uh immediately , a l a bulb lights up uh <EOS> displaying to the user that something has happened . <EOS> that's uh that's so the h user won't be um thinking , well uh did the button be pressed , w what happened uh . <EOS> or i press button <EOS> but nothing's happening on the t_v_ , <EOS> so is is something wrong or something . <EOS> so that's just to uh to to explain the of to to uh make it clearer to the user . <EOS> uh w well <EOS> the signal goes via chip <EOS> that's translated into uh electric sig uh electronic signals <EOS> and then it's processed <EOS> and then it's sent to the infrared bulb <EOS> where it will be uh uh received on the receiving end . <EOS> and those uh interpreted by the device , well in this case the television . <EOS> uh well <EOS> my personal preferences here , <EOS> well <EOS> we have to keep it simple . not too many uh gadgets and functions , <EOS> just like you said <EOS> uh well <EOS> the most users n <EOS> uh you have a lot of buttons <EOS> and you u u use you don't use them , <EOS> so why why should we invent uh w spend more time on those . <EOS> uh i i think we should stick by with infrared transmitting and uh no receiving . <EOS> so uh <EOS> no input from the television . <EOS> so <EOS> i think we shouldn't be uh spending time on um teletext and st things like that , <EOS> because when you uh want teletext on uh infrared you'd have to build in a receiver too , <EOS> and so <EOS> in order to receive the signals from uh what's on t_v_ and such . <EOS> so <EOS> i figure that would be uh spending too much money and time <EOS> and <EOS>
here we have an elephant . <EOS> first point , begins with an e_ , same like ebenezer . <EOS> also , elephants have a very good memory , much like myself , <EOS> and i can't remember <EOS> back when i used to live back in nigeria , <EOS> but i think i used to have a pet elephant . <EOS>
to use . <EOS> alphabetically . <EOS> um do you wanna start andrew ? <EOS> sure , <EOS> um so what is it you're asking of me now ? <EOS> i don't know , <EOS> just um your opinion on those four those four points really and how we used them . <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
yeah , <EOS> but i think the re the remote control , if you press tap the screen , it always should jump to the screen which has the volume button , channel button , and of course of also the on and off button . <EOS> mm . <EOS> oh right . <EOS>
uh do you think that's fair coming from a m the manufacturing ? <EOS> yeah <EOS> um i do think we that we we uh don't need the events chip on print , we only need the uh the regular chip on print , <EOS> so there may have been a m miscalculation in there . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> so i mean like you could actually <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah , gives you the options . <EOS> or we can <EOS> we can do one thing , <EOS> we can just have a remote control and casings of different different shapes , <EOS> different fruit shapes in such a way that a any casing can be could be fit into this mobile general piece . <EOS> so whatever people want , like if somebody want it in banana shape , we will put that casing onto that mobile phone , okay , <EOS> it will look l <EOS> uh yeah . <EOS> in that w <EOS>
perhaps the options should be uh <EOS> speech recognition scores even higher , huh ? <EOS> why not ? <EOS> yeah , well , <EOS> maybe because of the cost , <EOS> but uh nobody knows uh how much uh it will cost uh . <EOS> why not ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
right . <EOS> okay . this meeting is officially over . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm , yeah . <EOS> uh-huh . <EOS> alright . <EOS> bring a little picture of what i thought ours could look like . <EOS> so <EOS> just kind of minimise the clutter , <EOS> avoid too many buttons <EOS> and also um one of the things that people have used is a slide button , like you have on a mouse , <EOS> that possibly we could use that on the sides for volume , for example , have the slide button on the side , <EOS> and then you can pre-programme the channels , the voice recognition and then the voice response sample locator . <EOS>
we we could we could do um a double curved rubber one , <EOS> which would allow um say a banana , <EOS> but um unfortunately i see from my notes that if we do that , we have to have a push button as the interface , <EOS> we can't do anything fancier . <EOS>
yeah i think the colours detract a little bit . <EOS> some people might say it . yeah . <EOS> that has been , that has been dictated pretty much by the company . <EOS> so uh to answer that honestly i would rather say like uh , we have not solved the problem completely with the ugly remote because the colour is ugly , definitely . <EOS> 's nothing you can say about that . <EOS> i mean i much prefer something like brushed chrome with that form . <EOS> but <EOS>
okay . like categorising channels . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> okay , so s <EOS> oh sorry . <EOS> okay . <EOS> so it requires the use of l_c_d_ probably , to to tell you <EOS> to have some feedback . yeah . <EOS> yeah , probably , yeah , yeah . <EOS>
. <EOS> 'kay . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> mobile phones . <EOS> and y what you're doing is moving the menu from the television to the remote control , <EOS> so it's <EOS> mm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> you say three ? <EOS> i might go as far as two on that . <EOS> three . <EOS>
i think a flip up thing , <EOS> 'cause you always have this problem of like if it's on this <EOS> well i did anyway , <EOS> like we had five or six remotes and they would be lying on the c on the coach , <EOS> and you'd come and sit down and ooh , the telephone's the television switched on or something . <EOS> so maybe something that like <EOS>
huh . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm . <EOS> wow . <EOS> them , they're terrible . <EOS> but they all have this this feature of this uh it's not quite a scroll wheel , but it's a kind of selection in this circle , <EOS> it's a selection wheel . <EOS>
a dolphin . <EOS> 's like playing pictionary . <EOS> yeah , it's <EOS> yeah , i guess it has a fin on top too , yeah . <EOS> it's my dolphin . <EOS> so what characteristics do you like about your animal ? <EOS> i like its tail . <EOS> um , no , i think dolphins are really uh i dunno , they're smart and they they're cute and they like swimming and that's cool , like <EOS> they're graceful yeah , <EOS> and they're so <EOS>
okay . <EOS> can you e-mail your slides as well ? <EOS> is that possible ? <EOS> yes , i yes , i think i can . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> i'll just attach it to an email . <EOS> and you're you're number two , <EOS> three , <EOS> four ? <EOS> is that correct ? <EOS> okay . <EOS>
rubber . <EOS> yeah , . <EOS> is it to scale , or do you think you can make it a bit smaller ? <EOS> um it could be made a bit smaller , <EOS> and and of course it would be and <EOS> yeah , but um one thing we actually kind of um forgot while designing , that one side was supposed to be rounder , <EOS> so we said the back side round , yeah . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> maybe we can come we we can talk to them , and we can come with that , <EOS> you know . <EOS> and also well you can think of having uh since you have a you know something <EOS> maybe if you added little bit of display , <EOS> you might need the to che keep checking the battery , <EOS> so you really need a some kind of indicator , <EOS> so it could be a blinking option of l_e_d_ <EOS> it could actually be used to detect also . <EOS> if it's in a dark room you can basically detect it also . <EOS>
yeah , i think so . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> well um <EOS> then i'd like to make a proposal . <EOS> if you make one big touch screen , <EOS> yes . <EOS> use the same concept as here , <EOS> keep the buttons always available <EOS> and use the lower part of the touch screen for the rest . <EOS>
mm-hmm , yes . <EOS> mm . <EOS> i think we assume that it's still got play and stop functions and programming . <EOS> yes . <EOS> anything about that on the market research or something like regarding whether people want a combined something like that ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
we we had some discussions last time as as to uh how we might go forward <EOS> and we'll we'll finalise those uh da today . <EOS> um and thi this is all linked in with the the the user interface , <EOS> whether we p um go for voice , buttons , or or a bit of both . <EOS> uh and then uh , you know , f for the next meeting kate will be looking at the the the s the look , feel and design , <EOS> kendra the uh ho how the the user actually uses it <EOS> and and andrew of course the the product evaluation . <EOS> and uh kate and kendra will be producing a a model for us to uh to look at . <EOS> uh so , <EOS> if if we can have the the three presentations again please , <EOS> and uh um p perhaps you'd like to start uh k . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm 'kay . groovy . <EOS> so just general thumbs up for all of us then . <EOS> that kind of unfortunately is too quick . <EOS> uh . <EOS> i suppose yeah . um . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> okay . <EOS> well um . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> and again this has the advantage of being harder to lose . <EOS> sure . <EOS> i mean we are trying to promote a remote control , <EOS> but we wanna keep the company brand as well , <EOS> so . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so we always need to remember that somewhere we're meant to be getting the slogan on . <EOS>
where is the controller ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> it's in your family , in your home . <EOS> no , <EOS> but then it's it's like this uh <EOS> yeah , <EOS> but we're <EOS> here it's uh an object . <EOS> but here you say you want to use i uh s technology . <EOS>
and uh , you'd need the usual ones , like the changing the volume , changing the the channel <EOS> and then you uh <EOS> today we have uh um teletext and all those things . <EOS> tomorrow you might have a some more functions <EOS> which might come through that , so <EOS>
the ma <EOS> or materials . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> ye okay . <EOS> so it'd be like need more time and materials . <EOS> but you were allowed m creativity ? <EOS> i think so as like but you were supposed to have creativ <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> 'cause you you just upping the number of chips that you need to deal with each different function . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> well <EOS> if we're gonna pick betwe e <EOS> alright <EOS> so we have to pick between one of the two . um . <EOS> otherwise , yeah , we just it just becomes cost prohibitive . <EOS> what <EOS> which , which do we suspect we should hold o we should hold on to ? <EOS>
yes . <EOS> yep . <EOS> of course . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yep . <EOS> could could i go to findings ? <EOS> uh uh um i would uh like to explore the possibility of using um alternative um delivery and sales channel <EOS> which would be um to use the internet for promotion and ordering <EOS> and then to drop-ship the p product to the customer's residence . <EOS> that way you have no storage , you have no um <EOS> you do have transportation , still have the labour cost , <EOS> but you don't have the transport to the uh point of sale . <EOS> the point of sale is online . <EOS>
hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yes . <EOS> okay . <EOS> would anybody like to go first ? <EOS> yes . <EOS> sure . <EOS> okay . <EOS> so i've been looking at the components design . <EOS> um . mostly by consulting remote control diagrams from the internet <EOS> and also by incorporating design ideas from the last project meeting . <EOS> um , so we need some custom design parts , and other parts we'll just use standard . <EOS> um , i assume we'll be custom designing our case , <EOS> probably a hard plastic or some other material case , to protect the remote and the locator . <EOS> and we'll need to custom desi design a circuit board , <EOS> because the circuit board has to take the button input and send it to the output so you have to design that each time . <EOS> but once we come up with a design we'll send it to the circuit people and they'll just print it out . <EOS> um , standard parts include the buttons and the wheels , um the ipod-style wheel . <EOS> the infrared l_e_d_ is actually gonna be included in the circuit board that comes with it . <EOS> um , we need a radio sender and receiver , those are standard . <EOS> and al we also need a beeper or buzzer or other sort of noise thing for locating the remote . <EOS> so we have some material options . <EOS> um , we can use rubber , plastic , wood or titanium . <EOS> um , i'd recommend against titanium <EOS> because it can only be used in the flat cases and it's really heavy . <EOS> um , and the rubber case requires rubber buttons , so if we definitely want plastic buttons , we shouldn't have a rubber case . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> i like the idea though of having speech recognition for like the n the name of a channel like b_b_c_ , rather than having to remember the the number of it on the keypad . <EOS> that's a good idea . <EOS> yeah yeah <EOS> so you you you can just uh <EOS> because uh as more and more channels come then you have more and more problems to remember the v v exact channel numbers ex exactly , <EOS> even if you arrange it by however you arrange it , you still have the problem to remember exactly which channel you want to <EOS>
not having to learn to programme <EOS> and not having you know a million buttons . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> so <EOS> i think we can reasonably say it's another another one , <EOS> why not ? <EOS> mm . <EOS> uh can you just click the my mouse to move onto next page ? <EOS> uh , yeah <EOS> and what h did we make the management's <EOS>
no , <EOS> 'cause we didn't put the clock in it after all , <EOS> right ? <EOS> no . <EOS> button . <EOS> no . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> uh , button supplement special colour ? <EOS> speci <EOS> yes <EOS> special form ? <EOS> yes d we do have special form . <EOS>
you talking about concave curves ? <EOS> uh-huh . <EOS> both . <EOS> you think a single curved ? <EOS> the single curved in the sixteen . <EOS> that makes uh seventeen . <EOS> and what are just <EOS> the bt buttons , we have twelve buttons , are you sure ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> but um <EOS> i got a note saying that you two who are gonna be working together <EOS> so bef before you all disappear off just <EOS> okay , <EOS> i'll stay in here . <EOS> um . <EOS> hold hold fire . um . <EOS> does the pay-raise immediately come into effect on our next pay-check , or is that <EOS>
okay , so <EOS> hmm , okay . <EOS> yeah well uh <EOS> ipod is trendy . <EOS> and it is well curved square . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> square . like . <EOS> yeah , but mm is uh has round corners i think . <EOS> so <EOS> we shouldn't have too square corners and that kind of thing . <EOS>
what can i say ? <EOS> ebenezer , you wanna have a you wanna draw your favourite animal ? <EOS> sure . <EOS> whiteboard . <EOS> 'kay . <EOS> s <EOS> okay . <EOS> i will make this quick , <EOS> since we don't have much time . <EOS> um . 'kay , so <EOS> it's not the best picture in the world . <EOS>
yeah , that's right . <EOS> yeah maybe w maybe we could have a patent on this one . <EOS> yeah , yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> patent patent patent . mm . <EOS> banana remote . <EOS> i think we'd like to think the ideas were new , <EOS> but we've got no way of finding out . <EOS>
what ? <EOS> your surname . <EOS> uh abbing . a_ b_ b_ i_ n_ g_ . <EOS> okay , <EOS> thanks . <EOS> uh . <EOS> i was a little short on time , <EOS> but <EOS> yeah , me too , <EOS> so that's not <EOS> no no no , <EOS> i just fi first my <EOS>
so when you pre <EOS> yeah . <EOS> we're going to implement . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm just a little <EOS> mm mm mm mm mm . <EOS> yeah , i don't know what this means . <EOS> but i think we just evela evaluated this one . <EOS> yeah , i made some criteria uh , so we can uh ev evaluate our model . <EOS> i d d d i don't think if it's right . <EOS> that shall show it . <EOS>
it's will be embedded there <EOS> so it won't be really you know protruding or something . <EOS> mm-hmm . yeah . <EOS> yeah . oh <EOS> you can push push it again , you can push it . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> the other thing is , is the left hand one protruding ? <EOS> 'cause if people are left handed they want to use the other hand , <EOS> maybe it won't work so well . <EOS>
um <EOS> and as it's rubber the feel which is in this year is spongy , <EOS> so it's it's not quite spongy , but spongy , i would say is <EOS> yeah , so we're in . <EOS> . <EOS> well spongy , that's where . <EOS> yeah , we're we're ahead of the game there . <EOS>
um have you all seen the corporate website already ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> have you seen any flaws in it ? <EOS> i think i found one . <EOS> no ? <EOS> yep . visit it . <EOS> yep . <EOS> hmm ? <EOS> can't say i paid much attention to it , <EOS>
um , follow on with helen ? <EOS> yeah please . <EOS> oh , so we do yeah . <EOS> fun and games . <EOS> yep , sure , that's cool , um <EOS> yeah we have to take that out . <EOS> sorry . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> sorry . <EOS>
uh , <EOS> no . <EOS> what else can you do with a television ? <EOS> no . <EOS> i guess not . <EOS> we've got anon <EOS> aren't we forgetting something very important ? <EOS> have got got two examples here , <EOS> but i don't think there's anything we're missing . <EOS>
to be honest , i was <EOS> but i mean even even that is like this big . <EOS> yeah yes . <EOS> yeah , honestly speaking i was thinking that it was seven centimetres initially , <EOS> but it's seven inches . <EOS> but i i think we can we can cut it . <EOS>
cool . <EOS> oh neat . <EOS> yeah . mm . <EOS> yeah , yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> that's great . <EOS> okay . save everything to the shared documents , is that right ? <EOS> uh yeah , <EOS> i hope i can recover this , 'cause i've accidentally deleted it . <EOS> which doesn't really help me much . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> ah . <EOS> but you would still have the buttons . <EOS> or is it <EOS> do you think it should be only voice recognition and gesture recognition ? <EOS> or you you still have the possibility to use buttons ? <EOS> i think it we should give the uh flexibility to the user <EOS> and we think <EOS> yeah . <EOS> you can see they can switch form one modality to another . <EOS>
just whack in the number . <EOS> and you w <EOS> yeah . <EOS> and you wouldn't you wouldn't need uh a whole host of extra buttons for that , <EOS> you just need one <EOS> 'cause you've already got all the numbers there anyway , <EOS> yeah . <EOS> no . <EOS> you've already got the numbers for typing in anyway . <EOS>
so yeah , that's um , <EOS> those are the two important uh features i think we need on the remote , <EOS> but i mean we can discuss about what other kind of buttons we need , um . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> you know , i it could be , you know , if we if we wanna have like a very cheap kind of device , <EOS> i mean , we could either consider that maybe we want to sell this as a very , if it's gonna be a banana , you know that's a pretty gimmicky kind of thing that doesn't have that much functionality , <EOS> it's just you know a couple of scroll wheels and a button cause it's hard to get so many buttons on a banana <EOS> and it's still very <EOS> it may even be for most for some people more functional than their current remote , but if they have these scroll wheels , <EOS> so , um you know , what other buttons do we want ? <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> okay , <EOS> my personal preferences . um , <EOS> i think we should aim at the uh audience from sixteen to forty five . <EOS> mm , first of all um it's the biggest share , the biggest audience , sixty five percent . <EOS> uh second , i think you will get the most revenue from i from it . <EOS> um , yeah , <EOS> people from sixteen to forty five watch a lot of t_v_ , more than uh people who are el uh elder . <EOS> um second point , <EOS> we have to impro improve the most used functions , as i said here , switching channels , teletext and volume controls . <EOS> third point um that came out of the uh of the questionnaire , <EOS> uh people used to uh get lost off the remote controller , <EOS> so maybe it's an idea for us uh to design ex kind of placeholder uh on side of the , yeah , of the t_v_ <EOS> where you can put the the remote control in . <EOS>
okay , so brightness , contrast , things like that , <EOS> and then just actual device things , <EOS> like what channel you're watching , turning on an off , <EOS> stuff like that . <EOS> okay , um <EOS> yep . <EOS> colour , yeah . <EOS> yep . <EOS>
but , price obviously we have to talk about . <EOS> yep . <EOS> so what do you think about uh the design ? <EOS> do you think you can make it or uh <EOS> d <EOS> uh i'm sorry ? <EOS> what do you think about uh the design , uh what he was talking about of the speech recognition ? <EOS>
participant four . <EOS> so harry . <EOS> okay , after having the inputs from industrial design and user interface , i think most of the points which i want to are already covered here . <EOS> and to find the most interesting features what the users would be interested , then what we have done is we have put a feedback forms in all the magazines , <EOS> and the users send the feedbacks , <EOS> and based on that these are the findings which we got <EOS>
okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> what is the folder that you put yours in ? <EOS> and did it it did work ? <EOS> mm . <EOS> no . <EOS> no it did not work . <EOS> she send it to me by email . <EOS>
right , <EOS> my hand is uh different size than yours for example . <EOS> so , that's actually a really good idea for customi customisability . <EOS> um , one thing i thought might be kind of interesting is to put a flip screen on it , just like you have on flip phones , <EOS> so that you don't have this case where someone sits on the remote control or accidentally puts their hand on it , <EOS> especially if you have little kids around , they're not pressing the buttons while you're trying to watch a t_v_ show and accidentally change the channel or turn it off . <EOS> and also um you had issues with the batteries running out , <EOS> so i thought maybe we could put a little battery life-light on it that kind of goes dimmer and dimmer and dimmer as your battery is starts to die . <EOS> and in terms of invisible features , audio and um tactile feedback on button presses and , like you said , speech recognition . <EOS> so , in terms of what this thing would actually look like <EOS>
mm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> no , because you choose by channel , <EOS> so you choose by t_v_ program <EOS> so you don't have hundred channels to choose from . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> maybe you <EOS> uh-huh huh huh huh . <EOS> . <EOS> mm-hmm hmm hmm . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> sorry . <EOS> alright . <EOS> 'kay . okay , <EOS> the evaluation criteria , <EOS> huh ? <EOS> oh full screen , yeah . <EOS> huh . <EOS> evaluation . <EOS> 'kay , <EOS> my task was this time to put up a questionnaire <EOS> by which we can evaluate the design of the remote control by the questions we requirements from the of the users . <EOS> my name , my job , <EOS> okay . <EOS> the methods . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> alright so um <EOS> do you guys feel like there was room for creativity ? <EOS> i think we were pushed . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> pushed for creativity ? <EOS> i mean we weren't really given a lot of time , or materials , yeah , to go about our design task . <EOS> so i think we could've done with a bit more time . <EOS>
'kay . <EOS> with the printed circuit boards you were going for the <EOS> thanks . <EOS> um i it kind of depends um <EOS> if we're gonna have the speech recognition , we'd have to probably get an advanced one . i'm guessing . <EOS> uh but i don't know , <EOS> so that is something i'll have to look into . <EOS>
oops . <EOS> components . <EOS> the components design . <EOS> mm-hmm . okay . <EOS> um this time i'm i'm going to um concentrate more on the components and the technical side of the remote controller design . <EOS> uh , can you go on to the next slide , please . <EOS>
do the also with the thumb . so it should be a little bit longer so that you can put your uh thumb , also reach the middle . <EOS> or you should screen at the bottom and then you can see it very clearly . <EOS> okay so y yeah you have you have it in your hand , and the screen is below , and the buttons are in the middle . <EOS> okay for example if you put the screen here , <EOS> it's more about the functions now than the than the layout . <EOS>
yeah , yeah . <EOS> commands , words and use them when you don't want to use your fingers . <EOS> yeah . mm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> to push button , <EOS> yeah , yeah . <EOS> even it is for s just some kids , you know , switching channels one two three four . <EOS> yeah , turning yeah , yeah . <EOS> not very complex commands , but easy commands , <EOS> so . <EOS>
mael . <EOS> it's a dog . <EOS> so <EOS> but that's also kind of cat , <EOS> isn't it ? <EOS> oh <EOS> the dog doesn't have a tail ? <EOS> it's got a tail then . b bo both predators . <EOS> yeah , sure , yeah . <EOS> i thought so . the dogs have a tail . <EOS>
ah <EOS> this is not defined at all ? <EOS> ah , okay . <EOS> so what's what are your ideas about that ? <EOS> maybe i can have the your opinion from the marketing side ? <EOS> well uh do we sell other stuff ? <EOS> uh if if we bundle the remote control with something uh to sell then it could be a single device , otherwise it could be programmable one <EOS> otherwise who would buy a remote control from us . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> yeah . it's party party remote control . <EOS> the thing now is to to sell it . <EOS> yeah , it's your job . <EOS> sell it . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> right , go and sell it . <EOS> goo and good luck , so <EOS>
well , a little bit like the yes . <EOS> um . and then , if you know wind in the willows badger . <EOS> yeah and then uh i don't know if you know brian . <EOS> he's liverpudlian writer . <EOS> oh , okay . <EOS> alright . <EOS>
uh and well means , yeah . <EOS> the technical stuff was brilliant . <EOS> let's buy more . <EOS> uh right . um <EOS> i don't know what , new ideas found , means , to be honest . <EOS> yeah , we <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
uh yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . yeah , <EOS> i i think we're gonna have some trouble when we get down to the component design on this . <EOS> spongy is gonna be difficult , i'm afraid . <EOS> thanks . <EOS> alright . <EOS> yep . <EOS>
mm-hmm ? <EOS> okay . <EOS> ooh . <EOS> so we're 'kay ? on the or <EOS> no . i dunno where to put it 'cause the <EOS> okay . <EOS> could you s take it off ? . <EOS> is that alright ? <EOS> or <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> okay . <EOS> um , the case material , i've a been sent what the factory can actually give us , <EOS> the <EOS> there's the plastic <EOS> which i think we were gonna go for anyway as the main case case housing <EOS> and <EOS>
mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> uh , okay findings , that's the point that i'm working on currently <EOS> but uh so far i i was uh looking what what are the blue circuit , i mean radio wave radio frequency circuits are available now , <EOS> but the prices i read are high . <EOS> so , i know that uh the user interface people and these speak about radio frequency waves <EOS> because you can you can uh you can make the t_v_ do what you want even if you are in the bathroom or so on , <EOS> but you know , when you are not close to the t_v_ you probably won't need to to change the program and so on <EOS> and so i am i am voting for s to stick to the um infra-red control instead of r_w_ <EOS> but we will discuss it later maybe . <EOS>
wasn't me . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i <EOS> i didn't use it at all . <EOS> i i used it , <EOS> it it was <EOS> you can use it , <EOS> it's quite handy i think . <EOS> yeah , well <EOS> i use it as a a normal pen <EOS> and and and only you use it to uh get it on the computer , <EOS> huh ? <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm . <EOS> good . <EOS> or even you don't need to download it , it's streamed uh online uh yeah . yeah . <EOS> yeah it can be streamed online for you <EOS> and you can say what time i want to watch the movie <EOS> and <EOS>
uh i_d_ and u_i_d_ work together on prototype drawing on smart board . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> that's for the next one . <EOS> that's for th <EOS> so we should did it here ? <EOS> so we're staying here ? <EOS> or should we do it in the next meeting ? <EOS>
mm 'kay . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> so if we're keeping it basic we're loo loo what we're looking to sell it basically is it's uh just being very easy to use , looking exceptionally good , that sort of thing . <EOS> 'cause we really don't have anything else there , do we ? <EOS>
hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> but that's just sort of speculation , i mean . <EOS> what do you think ed ? <EOS> do you <EOS> he liked the display in one of the concepts that you showed , <EOS> um , <EOS> do you know how much it costs , um , to to add a little display like this uh ? <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> i know what you mean , <EOS> it's with us using the ideas for a mobile ph <EOS> it's with us using the ideas for mobile phones i kinda got sidetracked onto that i think , okay . <EOS> trying to think of other features we can build in that wouldn't cost too much <EOS> but maybe we'll leave that one on the side . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> something i'm going to <EOS> you want the <EOS> oh wait a minute . <EOS> do you need to do a presentation first ? <EOS> i don't know what order it goes in . <EOS> i have one . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i'm gonna check that out for a second . <EOS>
yeah . could be possible . <EOS> mm . <EOS> or like uh you have a menu button , you press <EOS> yeah , <EOS> or otherwise you have a menu button , <EOS> press menu <EOS> then you have uh main uh menu search uh all the all the settings . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i agree . <EOS> so , that great . <EOS> we have decided everything . <EOS> and think we are on a good way . <EOS> so , um uh the next meeting will start in thirty minutes . <EOS> um , so uh the the industrial manager uh will uh will work on the look and feel design . <EOS> the user interface uh uh mana uh manager will work on the user interface device . <EOS> and the the marketing expert will do the first project evaluation . <EOS>
all the other , all the other um buttons , such as ch um audio and picture selection um configuration buttons and things were used , you know , l approx well less than or equal to one times per hour . <EOS> um we also asked users um which buttons had the most importance to them , <EOS> you know , which which buttons they felt were the most important buttons on on the remote control . <EOS> and basically they came they said the channel , volume , and power buttons had the highest relevance to users , <EOS> um note that only power was very infrequently used , it only had a b a a fr usage frequency of about one times per hour , but users ranked it as having a very very high relevance . <EOS> um and the audio and picture settings had a very <EOS> that well the users thought that um w the audio and picture settings were very uh weren't very important to them um , <EOS> and they used them very infrequently a as well . <EOS> so we asked users what what um frustrates them the most about um current remote controls . <EOS> and fifty percent of the users said that uh what frustrates them is losing the remote control um somewhere in the room and not being able to find it . <EOS> um they also said that it um it takes a lot of time to learn a new remote control , <EOS> especially when there's many buttons and it's a , you know , a c a a unintuitive interface . <EOS> um and then thirdly , they some users commented on the fact that the the you know the way that you have to hold and press buttons on a remote control ar are bad and um cause u repetitive strain injury . <EOS> we also asked some users about some specific features that they'd like to see in the on the remote control . <EOS> in particular , do they want an l_c_d_ d display , <EOS> and secondly , do they think speech recognition uh is a useful feature to have on a remote control . <EOS> um basically our findings are that um amongst a younger age groups uh the answer is umv overwhelmingly yes . <EOS> they want these features , <EOS> they want these high technology features . <EOS> um for instance , ninety one percent of pe of people aged between fifteen and twenty five said yes , they want these features . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> with the locator button . <EOS> um and if it were the ball you'd no longer have to have a flat space on it . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> um like <EOS> if <EOS> we still have the how to hold on to it <EOS> and
mm-hmm . <EOS> i think that's probably something that w it's best if we take away with us , <EOS> but if we all have a think , when we go away from the meeting , what specific things could be um included in this remote control that that are out of the ordinary . <EOS>
so if this isn't to scale , what kind of dimensions are you thinking about here ? <EOS> well we want the other buttons to be big enough to push easily with a finger <EOS> so we reckon maybe that'll be about the same size as the palm of your hand . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> so we are having a combination of boards , <EOS> so f on the s simpler board , on the top we have this button , rubber buttons , to keep frequently changing the channels . <EOS> can we swap that round so th that the ones that we use all the time are on the bottom part ? <EOS>
uh because a lot of <EOS> channel one , channel four , <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , well maybe that would make it even more easy to use for them . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i think it would make it uh <EOS> yeah , i think it does . <EOS> because all the people who can't uh <EOS>
no , <EOS> only the face . <EOS> because we have we have twen twenty five minutes . <EOS> so we uh <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> we have to speed up . <EOS> remember you use uh different colours , and different pen widths . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay , <EOS> who wants to go next ? <EOS>
okay . now ? yeah . <EOS> stand-by button . <EOS> no <EOS> th that that incorporates the trend whilst at the same time not confusing people , if you're looking for functionality . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> well i dunno <EOS> i i guess maybe fruit and vegetables may be popular at the moment , <EOS> but as we know how fickle the fashion markets are , <EOS> maybe <EOS>
mm . <EOS> um <EOS> which one is that again sorry ? <EOS> three point one ? <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah that it's three point one was not that good . <EOS> four point one . <EOS> does the shape <EOS> the shape . <EOS> four point two ? <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> it does mark quite easily too if you let it fall . <EOS> i've got a mobile phone myself which is titanium and it does mark very easily if you drop it . <EOS> i was just wondering if we make the basic mould out of plastic but have like a rubber cover that goes over , <EOS> that would give the spongy feel , <EOS> that also allows us to kind of have different fasciae for the phone . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> but then they might not buy it if they haven't got one . <EOS> 'cause people might just be too fickle and not want to change . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , it's maybe too much of a big issue for here . <EOS> uh-oh danger sign . <EOS>
yeah . so <EOS> you just make the back of this part a bit bigger , <EOS> so that it lays a bit o <EOS> yeah . <EOS> isn't going to be a little bit heavy at the top ? <EOS> yeah , that's a bit of problem maybe . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> yep . <EOS> we have to go design the prototype . <EOS> okay . okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> thank you . <EOS> thank you . <EOS> thank you . <EOS> the problem is after all this meeting there is <EOS>
so um <EOS> like <EOS> yeah , so <EOS> can i see that thing ? <EOS> just this as examples . <EOS> um . <EOS> s <EOS> yeah , yeah , <EOS> i n i know the only p <EOS> i mean the the the the immediate thing that comes to mind with that is that it it it y you've then got the connection <EOS> and you've immediately got a sort of unreliability , <EOS> whereas the advantage of having it plumbed in is that that the whole thing is all , you know , completely soldered together <EOS> and it it it you know , total reliability , <EOS> but i mean i d i i uh <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> so maybe we should implement the audio sign , or something . <EOS> yeah <EOS> that was what i suggested . <EOS> you have it on <EOS> yeah <EOS> you have it's on some phones too , <EOS> which have a docking station . <EOS> and you just press a button <EOS> and the phone goes ringing . <EOS>
but most of yeah most of the young people to thirty to thirty years old were really interested in this kind of technology . <EOS> yeah , so maybe it's a good time for me to uh to bring you to some new uh new informations . <EOS> we had the new requirements from the so uh from the head offices of the company , <EOS> and so they wanted so they want to um they would like to be restricted to t_v_ . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> um therefore we have to to do some internet search . for example for um well what kind of applications do current remote controls support , and what are f featur features of uh current and future televisions ? <EOS> so we can see uh what needs to be supported . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> so like when you press a one on one t_v_ it go go to one . <EOS> and on the other t_v_ it won't work , basically . <EOS> so uh basically <EOS> what you have to do is uh get these patterns right . <EOS> and uh by d uh <EOS> that can be done by uh just uh cha yeah , changing this pattern all the time . <EOS> and um <EOS>
yep . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> alright . <EOS> um in <EOS> so <EOS> what are what are our buttons gonna be ? <EOS> on off <EOS> yeah . on off , <EOS> uh volume , favourite channels , uh and menu . <EOS> yeah , yeah <EOS> about <EOS> yeah like yeah , a bit like radio presets . um <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> um that's why i think the option of the the kinetic thing which basically means as long as you shake it like a watch , like an automatic watch <EOS> but are people gonna wanna shake their movie controller ? <EOS> mm . <EOS> um it's probably sensitive enough when you fiddle it . <EOS> so you could trigger that to a light , <EOS> like i said the bouncing ball thing , <EOS> or you could trigger that to use that to power the light <EOS> as opposed to <EOS> so when they pick it up , right , and then that that sorta triggers the <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . yeah . <EOS> um . uh <EOS> k <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> okay , well <EOS> l let's say that and then we can have our special coloured case <EOS> and then we at least have make it a little harder to lose . <EOS> because most m most remotes are a fairly dingy colour <EOS> that gets camouflaged under any pile of crap in a living room . <EOS>
save it in save it in the uh my documents . <EOS> it's already saved , i think . <EOS> so uh , that's done with this with this um doodah , <EOS> so you're . gonna do what you were gonna do , <EOS> thank you . <EOS> mm . <EOS>
well <EOS> i will give it maybe we have anyways <EOS> the way we have designed it's like the surf as you say <EOS> you know . <EOS> it <EOS> though the look is fine <EOS> but uh still i will give four in that case <EOS> you know . <EOS>
i don't know . <EOS> i i don't know if there was a ri i th <EOS> mine was the mics . <EOS> i didn't feel like getting up and down and dealing with all these wires , <EOS> i was afraid i was gonna break something actually . <EOS> yeah , that's it <EOS> 'cause the mics are loose <EOS> and each time you get up it's s a possibility of tripping over something or getting tangled or . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> so , ready ? <EOS> no not really . <EOS> just <EOS> 'kay . <EOS> crap . <EOS> sorry , <EOS> i i um <EOS> i'm afraid <EOS> okay . <EOS> it's perfect . <EOS> your judgement it's is biased . <EOS> uh thi this remote control will stay a prototype . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> you know , the the company it's it's , from what i can see from our other products , are yellow with blue writing on them . um . <EOS> mm . <EOS> right . <EOS> and our motto is is we put the fashion in electronics . <EOS>
um . <EOS> before we wrap up , just to make sure we're all on the same page here , <EOS> um , do we <EOS> we were given sort of an example of a coffee machine or something , <EOS> right ? <EOS> well , <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> uh-huh , yeah . <EOS>
mm , and the rechargeable batteries . <EOS> was there anything else there that we in the new new project requirements ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> um <EOS> yeah . <EOS> we've got the buttons <EOS> but i think we'll work through that with the design of it , um . <EOS>
oh . <EOS> what about kryptonite ? <EOS> which is quite cool . <EOS> so if you throw it , it's gonna store loads of energy , and you don't need to buy a battery 'cause they're quite f i find them annoying . <EOS> but we need to find cost . <EOS>
need it to be , okay . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay . yep <EOS> and i think that some specific instructions will be sent to you by your personal coach . <EOS> okay . <EOS> so , <EOS> no more questions , <EOS> we can close the session . <EOS>
oh it smells good . <EOS> of play doh yeah . <EOS> um and we're thinking to carry-on with the fruit and vegetable theme , the colour um combination just could just be named after different fruit , <EOS> like banana could be black and yellow , watermelon red and green , <EOS> or vanilla might be the most popular if it just uh blends in <EOS> more settled cream instead of the others are all a bit garish . <EOS>
it's the uh <EOS> yeah . <EOS> sure , okay . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> but we should focus on making the manual as user-friendly as possible <EOS> because a lot of them are just tiny little writing and lots and lots of pages . <EOS> it does , <EOS> you just put it in the drawer until something goes wrong <EOS> and then you try and search through it , <EOS> so that should be something we think about . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> i know what you mean yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> um and the other thing is from a production point of view <EOS> um the less components we use and the simpler the components means you reduce your cost and you increase your profit . <EOS> um and also the time to market and the complexity of developing designing and debugging it um so . <EOS> um okay let me just go back and talk about some of the restrictions . <EOS> um <EOS>
okay . <EOS> i thought forty five . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> oh . forty five ? <EOS> uh then would it be uh one o'clock . <EOS> or we we ask our personal coach . <EOS> okay . <EOS> thank you . thank you , uh that was a very uh good session i think , <EOS> we uh we <EOS>
am i right ? <EOS> yes . <EOS> the entire uh <EOS> uh . huh . <EOS> yep . <EOS> perhaps you can then copy page or so . <EOS> ooh . <EOS> no . <EOS> oh <EOS> you you made the entire could you <EOS> okay . <EOS> undo , <EOS> undo . <EOS> undo . <EOS>
yep . <EOS> i was thinking the same thing , yeah . <EOS> yes . <EOS> directly . <EOS> um-hmm . <EOS> yes . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> to the agents . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> you can do a shipping centre somewhere , <EOS> or strategically place shipping centres to minimise distance costs . <EOS>
oh . <EOS> really ? <EOS> i'll show you . <EOS> uh these lapel mics are trouble . <EOS> ts <EOS> oh right , <EOS> i think um <EOS> hold on . <EOS> yeah , i don't know if y <EOS> it it just ca it just came up on my um <EOS>
yeah i mean i guess that's the thing <EOS> is is if w i <EOS> if we can do this , that'd probably be <EOS> yeah . <EOS> really <EOS> yeah . <EOS> uh you wouldn't <EOS> i don't <EOS> i just don't think you would even need it . <EOS> so <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> so like uh well , <EOS> i dunno , <EOS> what's it like ? <EOS> i guess like an existing remote control , but molded and smooth . <EOS> whereas otherwise we'd thought , like with this one <EOS> or mix and match , <EOS> just we were gonna see what you thought , <EOS> the <EOS> uh a more spongy rubber cover with spongy buttons . <EOS> so <EOS> we have the two options we can follow , either the smooth hard plastic or the spongy rubber , depending on cost restraints . <EOS> and what we <EOS> well , <EOS> what conclusion we reach when we discuss it . <EOS> uh material yeah , that's what i have to say about material . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm , <EOS> so can we not programme a video with this remote control ? <EOS> it says for t_v_ only , <EOS> so looks like it's just <EOS> yeah , <EOS> i think maybe sky things like that might be incorporated into it , but <EOS> just channel-hopping . <EOS>
well , <EOS> if it doesn't work <EOS> i want to fill it in , but uh <EOS> no prob . <EOS> ah . <EOS> but you should uh direct <EOS> count it ? <EOS> li like write it be <EOS> well <EOS> we have to count some things <EOS> and we have to think about some things . <EOS> but you have to fill in this column , huh ? <EOS> no , <EOS> uh count uh number of functions , <EOS> because for every button you have to pay <EOS> and there are different screen shots , so or different different screens , <EOS> so <EOS>
so , who will be the the responsible for the functional design ? <EOS> any any volunteer ? <EOS> i think our uh responsibilities will be assigned when we in our mail we received from the account manager . <EOS> yeah , yeah . <EOS> uh <EOS> i'm doing the interface . <EOS>
i haven't as yet , no . <EOS> but uh i got uh i got an email that basically said to uh make sure that uh whatever device we come up with at the end of the day had to incorporate um the corporate colour and slogan . <EOS> so uh i'm guessing that uh uh <EOS> i notice on the bottom there it's got uh <EOS> what's that ? <EOS> a_p_o_g_e_e_ <EOS> that might be the corporate colour scheme , <EOS> although the only the only colour i can see in that is the red . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> so <EOS> yeah . yeah good idea . <EOS> so <EOS> i f <EOS> i think we we should come to some decisions now uh a about this . <EOS> um so <EOS> i understand uh when we want a display we need a expensive chip , <EOS> but when we want a scrolling wheel w we also need the expensive chip , <EOS> so can we use same chip , <EOS>
mm . mm-hmm . <EOS> right . <EOS> the functionality of it in the sense that you're sitting there , you're pressing this button and your t_v_'s not doing it . alright . <EOS> taking your t_v_ and your control and saying look this is what i'm doing , it's not working , what should i do ?
well , that's when you go to uni , isn't it ? <EOS> so , you know <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> but you don't have much money , generally . <EOS> i would've thought it's it's more that twenty five to thirty five , when people are really moving out and they've got their first job and they want their nice toys and <EOS>
yeah , but we which makes it kind of really big , yeah . <EOS> the length is gonna be difficu <EOS> yeah um <EOS> but you were thinking about making it smaller , yeah ? <EOS> uh this this kind of uh makes it more <EOS> and two , it might interfere with the i_r_ channel . <EOS>
or like single professionals or something . <EOS> twenty to like fifty five . <EOS> okay , single <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i dunno . <EOS> it's it's hard to narrow it down . <EOS> it's really hard to figure out right now . <EOS> i think the product appeals across a quite a broad range of ages . <EOS> i mean , we we said simplicity is is one of the features , <EOS> so it's going to appeal to people , maybe people who have problems with technology , you know , people who get scared by having lots of buttons , <EOS> and that might be older people , <EOS> but then we've also got fashion , <EOS> which is something that definitely appeals to younger people . <EOS>
keeps coming off . <EOS> 's fiddly . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> right . <EOS> how do we sta wa how do we start ? <EOS> does anybody know ? <EOS> oh , another one . <EOS> so that's this <EOS> oh okay , right . <EOS> are we free to take notes uh <EOS> okay . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> uh let's first watch paul's presentation first then . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> i'll check what they exact mean . <EOS> so uh <EOS> yeah , well <EOS> actually we have don't have an idea how much it's gonna cost . <EOS> but maybe it's cheap <EOS> and it's easy to implement . <EOS>
hmm . <EOS> titanium . <EOS> titanium would be be heavy , too , <EOS> wouldn't it ? <EOS> titanium . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> no , i haven't really <EOS> um i wanted feedback , <EOS> i think we need to rate rank these , <EOS> but we'll see what your uh personal preferences are and your thoughts . <EOS>
um cats are sometimes very independent . <EOS> my parents had cats . <EOS> uh and they can mm decide for themselves what is best . <EOS> okay . now um we have to get down to the nitty-gritty of how to make this <EOS> and this remote control has to be sold um we're to sell it for twenty five euros , <EOS> with a profit aim ultimately of fifty million euros . <EOS> that tells you something about how many um we have to sell on an international scale . <EOS> um would be an awful lot of these , <EOS> would be like what , a hundred million of them um to make twenty five euros on each one and to make a total profit of fifty million . <EOS> um the production is to only cost twelve and a half euros per item . <EOS> now <EOS> if they cost twelve and a half , you're selling it for twenty five , you're making twelve and a half euros each . <EOS> um and we're to make a profit of fifty million , <EOS> that's t uh <EOS> can you do the maths <EOS> and how many are we selling ? <EOS>
hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> um <EOS> mm . <EOS> uh it definitely needs uh a lot more research <EOS> on like how much more it would be <EOS> and any , you know , existing examples , <EOS> and what reactions to them have been , and that sort of thing . <EOS>
maybe if the bottom was just sort of flat , <EOS> and then the rest is like <EOS> yeah <EOS> the bottom could be like ch chopped a bit . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> but then it wouldn't sit as comfortably in your hand . <EOS> round . <EOS> oh . that's true . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> i th i s <EOS> i think if we're gonna go down that route , then we're talking about uh even if it costs slightly more than that , um just building the whole thing in one , <EOS> then having getting cheaper production costs <EOS> um and , you know giving people the option of buying a new uh a a complete new thing , <EOS> the advantage of a replaceable cover is that even if they don't it doesn't have a cover on at all , it will still work um totally . <EOS> um then if , you know , if people lose the cover , i mean they they might be well inclined to go out and spend however many euros on a on a new one um rather than a a complete new re remote . <EOS>
can we leave now <EOS> or <EOS> half an hour . <EOS> thanks . <EOS> you're fired . <EOS> no . <EOS> mm . <EOS> alright . <EOS> alright <EOS> let's move on . <EOS> let's see what we got to do . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> see you later . <EOS>
oh right . <EOS> i suppose you c try make it a universal remote <EOS> for <EOS> could work on all sort of electrical <EOS> 'kay . <EOS> products in in one person's house . <EOS> but , you know , they all sorta have the same role changing channels , volumes and then programming . <EOS>
we're over ? <EOS> grand . <EOS> we're under . <EOS> okay . <EOS> oh , i see . <EOS> so we can go to production . <EOS> alright . <EOS> we can go to <EOS> i dunno what i just did . <EOS> okay . <EOS> now we're gonna talk about the project process <EOS> um and whether or not we're satisfied with the whole process and the result . <EOS> um did we have a lot of room for creativity ? <EOS> did we have a lot of room for individual leadership , <EOS> um teamwork , <EOS> and the means , meaning the technology that we used to produce our little guy there , <EOS> and if we found any new ideas . <EOS> now , question is , how do we do this ? <EOS>
uh it's gonna be small . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so it'll beep if you wanna find it <EOS> you just uh shout y h just <EOS> it just has to re respond to you when you look for the device . <EOS> i dunno how bu <EOS> yeah , of course small . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> i think we are focusing on a sort of mid-range um , business kind of class type people . <EOS> mm . <EOS> i'm just thinking of budgetary issues too , <EOS> for when it does get to the sort of broad scale marketing stage , we want to , you know , not waste money , not be profligate <EOS> and uh
per <EOS> i dunno where it <EOS> yeah . <EOS> well , <EOS> but we know that we're having at least three colours , <EOS> so <EOS> so let's y say three . <EOS> well , <EOS> are we talking about on each colour combination <EOS> or are we , <EOS> you know , <EOS> we'll <EOS> like we'll have yellow and black . <EOS> is that two special colours ? <EOS>
yeah , yeah . <EOS> i i think if we include a lot of technology on the remote control it will be very costly . <EOS> no , <EOS> because <EOS> no , <EOS> it's not very a lot . <EOS> th this information exists . <EOS> for example you can get um <EOS>
okay . <EOS> so first we'll have the prototype presentation . <EOS> do you need the um powerpoint for this ? <EOS> um yeah . <EOS> i just got a few slides , so show them . <EOS> alright . <EOS> thank you . <EOS> um <EOS> do you want to present it ? <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> 'kay . <EOS> uh-huh . <EOS> well what about <EOS> this might get a bit too expensive actually , <EOS> but what about um something that's built into the t_v_ um that you can press and it'll send out a little signal <EOS> you know like the ones that we can't hear or something <EOS> um that that will activate the remote control starts to beep . <EOS> if you find if y <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> the pro okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> alright . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . okay . <EOS> uh . <EOS> yep . <EOS> i guess so . <EOS> well <EOS> no <EOS> i'm just a bit wondering what we're gonna do the next uh yeah . <EOS> do we only have to to do uh phase one , the functional design uh ? <EOS>
in fact on a flat place <EOS> i i this is just a base . <EOS> you can just <EOS> you can <EOS> yeah but then uh when you turn turn it <EOS> yeah . <EOS> oh <EOS> oh ye yes , that's right . <EOS> yeah , no no , no . you can't put it out . <EOS> it's just your turning from the base . <EOS> you need to have everything in hand . <EOS> if you want to turn , you can't use it and turn . <EOS> it's impossible . <EOS> you need to put it on and turn . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> but if it's a r_r_ , it would be real reaction , <EOS> like if it had a symbol on it . <EOS> mm . <EOS> there's loads of companies that called r_r_ . <EOS> mm . <EOS> whoa . <EOS> this is slog but this is the slogan , this is the the the the type . <EOS>
like white , also ni or uh always nice . <EOS> and what colours should the buttons be ? <EOS> uh <EOS> because um <EOS> yeah , different colours . <EOS> this is <EOS> just um <EOS> oh , the same as th th the cover . <EOS> but also th the light behind it . <EOS>
so , obviously we w w <EOS> i just did a run down the evaluation of the form , <EOS> the fan uh the fancy stylishness of the of the unit , the ease of use , speech recognition , cost , we've gone through these . <EOS> now , the company must evaluate the feasibility of being able to take enough of the market to justify in production . <EOS> or we project this over two years , <EOS> but being that the market changes very very quickly , maybe there's no more interest in buying this thing in eighteen months from now . <EOS> so , now we have to come up with a decision . <EOS> can the company sell two million units ? <EOS> can it sell it for fifty euros ? <EOS>
cost is yeah . <EOS> yeah . mm . <EOS> there's also a watch moves around a great deal more . <EOS> do you think ? <EOS> uh . <EOS> yeah . w <EOS> yeah , <EOS> i don't think it would . um . <EOS> and solar cells , i dunno about that . <EOS>
yeah , <EOS> but <EOS> yeah , that will be a problem . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> well <EOS> you d you have to keep in mind that uh several t_v_s uh don't even have a menu structure , <EOS> or they have a very simple menu structure , <EOS> so <EOS> you have to keep in mind that not all uh d not <EOS> our remote won't be able to work on all televisions . <EOS> and that would be uh a considerable problem . <EOS>
but if you c if you could scroll through the channels , and then the volume would just be <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> we have five minutes left for the meeting , so . <EOS> and the volume would just be like the same way , forward and backward as i'm just thinking like it would make it much like sleeker sort of looking . <EOS> and otherwise , no matter how may buttons we have , we're gonna have like , you know , black with red sticking out <EOS> and th no <EOS> it's gonna inevitably sort of start looking like those group of sort of ugly ones that we saw stacked up . <EOS>
okay ? <EOS> any questions so far ? <EOS> big microphone . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> just uh just an idea about how to m th that could also be possible . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> oh okay . <EOS> that's the place where it's going to be , not the size . <EOS>
so without l_c_d_ ? <EOS> our gi <EOS> i think that the our our product is uh has the best in all <EOS> well this is a biased judgement <EOS> because we designed them . <EOS> no no <EOS> according to design aspect we want to know how would you feel the innovativeness ? <EOS>
is it easy to use ? <EOS> feasible ? <EOS> ye uh <EOS> you said previously that you there's um microphone inside an <EOS> embedded . <EOS> yeah , this is microphone array , in fact . <EOS> there four microphone . <EOS> so they they they they there's a microphone array . <EOS>
here we go . <EOS> cheers . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> and i think that's in the shared , if i did it right , if anyone wants to look at it . <EOS> mm 'kay , <EOS> thank you . <EOS> okay , <EOS> great . <EOS> okay . <EOS>
okay , <EOS> so we stick with what we've got there . <EOS> mm 'kay . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> well , it's kind of gotta be our company's yellow . <EOS> so again i mean like we could have , uh i mean , we could quite easily have the the main body be a different <EOS>
nah , the televi the television would have to be a bluetooth compatible , basically . <EOS> an and there is no there is no such thing . <EOS> i with the television , yeah . <EOS> i was just trying to find an advantage . <EOS> wha what w what advantage would you get for the <EOS>
oh , <EOS> how long was our meeting supposed to be ? <EOS> how much time do we have left ? <EOS> forty ish <EOS> i i i mm we should go on a bit yeah about the project eval , um . <EOS> i dunno about you guys but i felt like a bit under-stimulated on the whole thing . <EOS> like , <EOS> what like you know what am i really doing , <EOS> you know <EOS> what is <EOS>
are <EOS> well because <EOS> for the same reason that we cannot uh informations on the t_v_ . we c we couldn't grab information information which is not there . <EOS> no <EOS> but i mean with the internet you have flexibility of where you get your information from . <EOS> so it may be possible that there are people out there providing that . uh . <EOS>
it's when we get satellite . <EOS> mm . <EOS> get your own remote , or digital cable . <EOS> 'kay . um . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i guess , we're gonna discuss the project financing later , <EOS> making sure that we can fit all of the stuff that we want to on our budget . um . <EOS>
nice . <EOS> mm . <EOS> um , components of a remote control , okay . we've already kind of gone over this <EOS> but we're gonna have to get into more detail <EOS> and probably have to reach some conclusions some time soon . <EOS> energy source , um , our manufacturer offers a variety of energy sources , your standard battery , solar cells . <EOS> our manufacturer didn't say anything about lithium <EOS> so we might have to look <EOS> if we do go that route , we might have to look elsewhere . <EOS> um , and also there's a kinetic energy possibility . <EOS> basically , it's like a um the idea of moving the remote would create enough energy to keep it running . <EOS> so that's one possibility <EOS> but i don't know whether that would be powerful enough to illuminate a touch screen . <EOS> so we'll have to look into that . <EOS>
did you ? <EOS> you waiting for me ? <EOS> i know , <EOS> what a teaser ain't it . <EOS> um . right . <EOS> fascinating , compelling even . <EOS> so <EOS> current market trends . <EOS> screen . <EOS> um , basically i was looking at what's going on in the remote control market right now <EOS> and what's going on in other design fields , <EOS> to see sort of what's what's trendy , what's new , what's happening . <EOS> um , remote control right now basically everybody says they want newer , fancier , more exciting <EOS> they're sick of this boring , normal , functional , <EOS> um that we need innovative design options <EOS> and there needs to be an easy user interface . <EOS> um the challenge is that current trends right now , across the board in fashion , in furniture , in technology , is a very organic fruit and vegetable kind of thing . <EOS>
that doesn't count though does it ? <EOS> does does light charge as as sunlight does ? <EOS> artificial light ? <EOS> i thought it was u_v_ like <EOS> no . <EOS> is it ? <EOS> alright i <EOS> has to be solar . <EOS> any , any <EOS> yep . <EOS> regarding those sizes , which one you think will be light <EOS> because we we have to take into consideration size also , <EOS> so maybe a standard triple a_ might take lesser space or <EOS> and dynamo might take more space . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> so it's maybe good idea . <EOS> s s <EOS> it's um compliments to the artist . <EOS> it's um you need to work on the weight a little bit . yes . <EOS> and maybe the shape of the buttons , <EOS> the little egg shapes aren't the most economical , but <EOS>
i think that would make it very complex . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm not real <EOS> i don't know if there is really , <EOS> no um <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> nah . <EOS> um <EOS> i would say no need for a talk-back . <EOS> uh does anybody disagree with that ? <EOS>
i'd i'd say though that we if we did make the decision to go with the cradle though , the then we have that as well , <EOS> but wi with a similar <EOS> what i if when when we have <EOS> yeah <EOS> when we when we have something like the cradle or or something give that's <EOS> as as a marketing standard i need something to market , to make this product unique . <EOS>
mm . right . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> i must say that um the uh i c can't remember what um f you know phone service i was using the other day , <EOS> but that had sorta speech recognition <EOS> which worked uh remarkably well , <EOS> so that is indeed a uh um <EOS>
hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> we need <EOS> yeah so <EOS> i i just said that the components uh the list of components uh has to be uh yeah listed <EOS> and um and um assembly is a an important process <EOS> that has to be taken into account . <EOS> and uh for the designing of the cove uh uh cover layout then it's better to to to maybe see that with uh the the u_r_ exp u_r_i_ expert <EOS> so that we can it's really a team-working <EOS> uh . so <EOS> i i cannot design something without your agreement , <EOS> right ? <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so where are the fruit and vegetables now ? <EOS> we we don't know . <EOS> fruits and veg . <EOS> i guess they would be either in the colour of that plastic face on the front , or in the colour of the squishy thing underneath . <EOS>
well what you <EOS> for the ipod you press an <EOS> w right if you're on the channel let's say , then you press on the middle and then if you do that again the volume goes up , and if you do that it goes down . <EOS> but if you wanna keep it with volume here and here , i'm pretty sure <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so you'd have a finder feature rather than a voice recognition feature . <EOS> and you were talking <EOS> hmm . <EOS> maybe <EOS> unless something else comes up . <EOS> mm . <EOS> and you were talking about scroll buttons ? <EOS> um yeah <EOS> i think um i think we've decided that it's gonna increase the cost <EOS> and give no real kinda extra benefit <EOS> and it's gonna decrease from the sleekness of it . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> so we are agree with a small <EOS> or uh or i don't know <EOS> but i don't want to now invent something new , because we didn't discuss about it . <EOS> so using some l_c_d_s we can touch , so we can remove uh keys and just uh having uh , i dunno the name , l_c_d_ responding to fingers . <EOS> touching the screen . something like <EOS> mm like tactile . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> on the back , or <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i mean like the <EOS> yeah but since we have the l_c_d_ , we didn't need too much button too many buttons . <EOS> um , okay , just um the decision of the power button . <EOS> should we make it a button , or some some something which would be <EOS>
uh components . <EOS> yeah layout . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> oh no . <EOS> yeah okay . <EOS> yeah . it's okay . <EOS> you probably opened it . <EOS> yeah true . um <EOS> f_ five . <EOS> f_ five . <EOS> there is a lot of um factors involved in choosing the components . <EOS> there's a lot of options that we have to discuss . <EOS> uh for example the energy source . we have four types . <EOS> the basic battery . <EOS> uh we have a hand dynamo , <EOS> which we yeah we dutch refer to it as the kneipgatt . <EOS> uh the kinetic provision of energy which means if you move the thing , if you shake it . <EOS> which will be fun for toddlers right , if they wanna use the <EOS>
and incorporating the company logo ? <EOS> yep . <EOS> have you <EOS> uh sorry <EOS> i didn't mention this , <EOS> but we'll be incorporating in the design . <EOS> mm . <EOS> 'cause i took it from the feedback you gave in the last meeting from y from y your report , it's not just a case of having a little r_r_ hidden somewhere , they do want it to be obvious that it's our product <EOS> don't they ? <EOS>
i know , <EOS> but <EOS> but um by this i think it's more a case of fruit and veg , <EOS> yeah <EOS> we gotta . <EOS> i'd say the colour of the border there world you'd find that , that's that'd stand out . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> like yellow , <EOS> yeah . <EOS> it would also help keep the the product placement <EOS> s <EOS> yeah . <EOS> is it inspired by clothing fashion ? <EOS>
yeah , <EOS> 'cause i don't have any material pricing information available to me at the moment , so <EOS> 'kay . <EOS> and don't forget we need to include the colour of our company and the logo . <EOS> the colour being yellow ? <EOS> wait . <EOS> i'm guessing . <EOS> and the r_r_ . <EOS>
it should have a memory switch , a mute button in case the telephone rings or something . <EOS> uh speech recognition is one of her very f favourite personal uh features she would like see d d to be integrated in this um in this new remote . <EOS> um . <EOS> should be child friendly design with few buttons , <EOS> colourful maybe with s star shaped or other shaped buttons . <EOS> um she uh presented also an oversized remote which she guarantees nobody will ever be able to lose . <EOS>
just to get less buttons on the remote control , to make it easier and quicker to learn . <EOS> janus , can you uh <EOS> uh yeah yeah , i'll go , sure . <EOS> right uh , <EOS> i'll be uh explaining a bit about uh working design about uh the project . <EOS> well uh <EOS> what i did was i dissected uh uh current remote controls <EOS> and um i viewed how how they w looked , <EOS> how they worked , <EOS> uh what kind of components are involved , <EOS> and how they are connected together . <EOS> and uh after that i put up a scheme about how uh these things are organised <EOS> and i'll show it to you in in a in a few seconds . <EOS> and i'll explain a bit about uh how it works <EOS> and how we could uh build one <EOS> and why i think several possibilities uh that we discussed in the earlier meeting falls off . <EOS>
okay , . <EOS> so marketing . <EOS> so you are <EOS> you saved your y your presentation somewhere ? <EOS> yep . <EOS> so you're four ? <EOS> four , yeah . <EOS> which is trend watch . <EOS> okay . <EOS> mr marketing experts . <EOS> yeah that's me . <EOS> uh . well i investigate the preference more d <EOS> i investigate deeper the preference of the users . <EOS> uh so the the current investigation th uh th uh <EOS> sorry <EOS> the current <EOS>
mm p <EOS> please . <EOS> mm . <EOS> um what we can do is , well you know that batteries throwing a aw remotes run through batteries like crazy . right ? <EOS> and s for some people <EOS> yeah . <EOS> well maybe not a solar remote <EOS> but instead what about if we had like a power cradle ? <EOS> like a a cradle that is is there to hold the remote when you're not using it , <EOS> so you'll always know where the remote is <EOS> 'cause you have to put it back there to charge the remote , <EOS>
hmm , maybe , <EOS> i don't know . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> i know uh you can buy a re a universal uh control for uh only twenty uh euros <EOS> okay , <EOS> so <EOS> we we just say we just say that's universal remote control . <EOS> okay , perfect . <EOS>
it's a duplication . <EOS> there is that . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> i don't think that's to taxing to uh s engineer . um . <EOS> but as for actually arranging them let me go back to the to the picture of the kiddie one . <EOS> and i quite like it , <EOS> 'cause it's just smooth and hand-held <EOS> and it's got these easily reachable buttons <EOS> that quite nicely uh spaced out , <EOS> so something a bit like that with buttons arranged in a kind of circle . up , down , left , right . <EOS>
i like . <EOS> we should c we should come up with a fuzzy one as well . <EOS> for those cold winter days . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> something really cool . <EOS> leopard print or something . <EOS> leopard print . <EOS> um . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> i think , it wouldn't be such a bad idea to have a like a locator device , <EOS> maybe a simple button that you have on your television to help you find your remote . <EOS>
well , the kinetic thing , yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> that was our main technological innovation <EOS> w every everything else was fairly simple , but the fact that we used the kinetic energy was new . <EOS> . <EOS> so it's . <EOS> so we'll give it a <EOS>
well you could <EOS> mm . <EOS> it could come <EOS> but it could come in different colours and have the r_r_ colours just somewhere <EOS> like just around the lock button could be the r_r_ logo or colours and <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm . <EOS> if . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> don't know . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> um . 'kay . <EOS> what is that ? our limited ability to think outside the box ? <EOS> kind of . <EOS> so this was other costs . <EOS> are we back into project mood ? <EOS> i dunno . <EOS> i think this is <EOS>
yes . <EOS> yeah , yeah <EOS> j with these rubber these rubberised ca <EOS> not the actual uh plastic outside case , just the rubber thing that goes round the outside . <EOS> mm . <EOS> okay . the rubber . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay we've got five minutes , <EOS> um , or that might've been up for a while . <EOS>
hmm ? <EOS> no , i hadn't . <EOS> i just received it . <EOS> yeah . oh <EOS> ignore that . <EOS> they don't work so hard at the finance department . <EOS> ah okay . <EOS> i suppose this is a <EOS> well , so <EOS> okay , so <EOS> we lose the scroll wheel , <EOS> the s <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> we should hide them somewhere . <EOS> in the menus of the l_c_d_ or in the back of the remote control , or something like that . <EOS> hide them , okay . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> uh , okay , what else ? <EOS>
um . <EOS> yes . <EOS> um i have a lot of the information there . <EOS> it might not be very clear . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> is there <EOS> unless you want to plug it back in to yours . <EOS> um . <EOS> we could do , yeah . <EOS> um yeah we should . <EOS>
you get th <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> i think it does . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> and the design . <EOS> well <EOS> i think uh especially because of the microphone and the l_c_d_ screen also . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i don't know whether older people will use it , but <EOS>
mm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> is practically sound . <EOS> so um , <EOS> i dunno <EOS> we'll have to decide which which angle we're gonna go to or both . <EOS> mm-hmm . okay , yeah , yeah , well <EOS> i d i think an any uh any facets that we identify w we aim need to aim for for all of . <EOS> um okay well <EOS> first thoughts on um <EOS>
yeah . okay , so i'm the first one . <EOS> so , um for the user interface designer , which is hamed um , mm-hmm . <EOS> uh , you are going to work on the technical functions of the remote control . i see . <EOS> okay . <EOS>
obviously . <EOS> the money from this project . <EOS> yes , <EOS> okay <EOS> i don't mind to convince the the management , <EOS> okay . <EOS> if the bottom line is positive . <EOS> mm . <EOS> the management says , okay , so they they don't want certain facilities , <EOS> which it's already worked , <EOS> okay , <EOS> they want something uh new , <EOS> okay . <EOS> i think uh like uh speech recognit definitely they will agree , <EOS> i don't think they'll say no for that , <EOS> okay . <EOS> and uh i hope i can convince the management on that , <EOS> okay . <EOS> so <EOS> if you have any uh new ideas , okay , for uh your you can always come up <EOS> and uh you can tell me if you need any uh s special , okay , coordination , okay , between any uh technical companies , <EOS> which you can uh hide their technology backup , okay , for your uh functional design or technical design , <EOS> okay , <EOS> then i am ready to do that . <EOS>
blue . <EOS> i wonder w which cell do i want . <EOS> it's fun to touch . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so . yeah . <EOS> okay , i didn't realise you had that bit . <EOS> so . <EOS> oh could you pass the tomato please . <EOS> sorry . thank you . <EOS>
hmm . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> 'cause we need to know how big it's gonna be and how heavy . <EOS> okay , that kind of brings us to this , <EOS> let's let's see if we can decide what kind of energy source we want to have first and foremost . um . <EOS>
i believe so . <EOS> just ask . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> i dunno where she . <EOS>
and um so <EOS> what i have found and after a lot of work actually i i draw this i draw for you this uh schema <EOS> that can be maybe too technical for you <EOS> but is very important for me <EOS> you know . <EOS> and uh that's it so i won't go into details about that <EOS> but uh these are my preferences to use uh that kind of components . <EOS>
yep . <EOS> ooh , <EOS> i just got an idea for a design . <EOS> good . <EOS> anybody have anything else they'd like to bring up in this meeting ? <EOS> i had something , but i forgot . <EOS> okay . get out of here . <EOS> let's go back to the meeting closure then and see what we need to do next . mm . <EOS> alright . <EOS> after this meeting we're gonna be sent a questionnaire and summary again which we need to reply to that e-mail . <EOS> and then we're gonna have lunch break . <EOS> and after lunch thirty minutes of individual work time . <EOS> um i'm gonna put the minutes <EOS> i put the minutes for the first meeting already in the project documents folder , <EOS> if you'd like to review them . <EOS> and i'm gonna type up the minutes for this one as well . <EOS> um here's what we're each going to do . <EOS> the i_d_ is going to work on the components concept , <EOS> um u_i_d_ the user interface concept , <EOS> and you're going to do some trend watching . <EOS> 'kay . <EOS> specific instructions will be sent to you by your personal coach . <EOS> and if anybody has anything they would like to add ? <EOS> no ? <EOS> okay , well , this meeting is officially over . <EOS> thank you all . <EOS>
so yeah , um um . <EOS> um will device appeal to all age groups ? <EOS> i think it will <EOS> because i mean uh old older people who can't manage the buttons anyway will actually probably like the like like the voice bit so <EOS> mm . <EOS> i think so . <EOS>
yeah , that's right . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so we can <EOS> that's right . yep . <EOS> yep . <EOS> no no . <EOS> components . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so , will you go to the next slide ? <EOS> yeah so this is the design which we are thinking so . <EOS> we are having a power button and the switch , which is not much , <EOS> and then we are having the which is to indicate whether the power is on or not . <EOS> and then there are two kind of things which can be <EOS> so one is the button interface which has not been shown because because of lack of time . <EOS> so we could not put that . <EOS> so now where the a_s_r_ decoder is sitting , similarly there are different kind of interfaces which could be there . <EOS>
sorry ? <EOS> it just seems to be skipping on without us doing anything . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> i've found that <EOS> try and get it back . <EOS> if you right click <EOS> and then go onto a previous slide . <EOS> ah it's alright . <EOS> um . there wasn't much more to say about that , just rambling . <EOS> um some of the uh remotes that i looked at , one of the models da did actually have voice recognition where you could um where it was connected to the remote control functions . <EOS>
not fat ? <EOS> not fat . <EOS> not fat , huh . <EOS> okay . <EOS> might be hard to find , though . <EOS> yep . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> but let's try it , okay , with the different uh the designs , okay , the functional designs . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah i think so . i i think so . <EOS> now the the only thing i i on the interface side of it , is that i i i see the dilemma . <EOS> primarily . <EOS> yep . <EOS> but if we have the option of of scrolling at any particular speed , or the option of jumping direct , okay . <EOS> so i can go uh presuming i have , on my television , something that tells me what channel i'm on , i can scroll direct from channel five to channel thirty two . <EOS>
i mean i've never bought a remote . <EOS> it sounds like this remote's going to be purchased separately from the television , <EOS> which is a little <EOS> i'm not sure . <EOS> well they usually are . <EOS> well <EOS> my <EOS> i've never bought just a remote , like , so i don't i don't really know . <EOS> but um <EOS>
yeah , yeah , yeah . <EOS> yeah , yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> but but imagine someone with s <EOS> my flatmates actually had one with a wheel , and it it did show up on the t_v_ . <EOS> i oh yeah ? <EOS> but i what if you have satellite and you have like two hundred channels . <EOS> then to get to channel one eighty nine you have to <EOS>
no but <EOS> it's a couple years off at least . <EOS> it's pos a possible new product . <EOS> um , but i think that's i think that sums up the main features of our of the remote , <EOS> um i dunno if you guys have any questions <EOS> or f whether that uh whether we need to worry about any uh other marketing areas or anything of that nature . <EOS> um , did we come in under budget ? <EOS>
okay . <EOS> and and your question is how many do we have to sell ? <EOS> yes , <EOS> 'cause our market um is international <EOS> and your problem is has to do with marketing of <EOS> you know , <EOS> you gotta know how many we're going to be selling to know how big a market you have to target and who is that . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> but uh i think we can keep it all under budget . <EOS> so uh yes , <EOS> so the speech thing you said our our techno our research and development department came up with some break-through . <EOS> so just in time . <EOS>
what ? <EOS> it it does . <EOS> thanks . <EOS> it does . <EOS> very good . <EOS> alright , let's go back to this <EOS> no , that's it . hmm . <EOS> oops . <EOS> okay , so now uh we're moving on to finance , <EOS> okay . <EOS> i'm gonna show you an excel spreadsheet <EOS> and we're going to fill it in together based on what components we're including in our remote and see if it's under twelve fifty euro . <EOS> if so , we can proceed , <EOS> if not , we need to go back to the drawing board a little bit . <EOS> 'kay ? so let me bring that up . <EOS> here we go . <EOS> alright . <EOS> um it's not hand dynamo , it's powered by battery , so we give it a <EOS>
yeah , <EOS> because maybe some people prefer a red remote control , <EOS> some people prefer black remote control . <EOS> yeah , yeah , yeah . yeah , <EOS> but this is what we would ask to the users , so . <EOS> and also f <EOS> maybe we can have di di we can have uh several options , <EOS> so user can select which colour they prefer , so . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> alright . <EOS> and we've therefore we have to do the final questionnaire and do the meeting summary , <EOS> i have a final report to present , <EOS> um and then we're done . <EOS> . <EOS> okay . <EOS> we done good , <EOS> and we're finished in time . <EOS>
well <EOS> it seems like <EOS> i dunno <EOS> it seems to me that we could just do the um stick with the rubber <EOS> 'cause since we're probably gonna be using some kind of um rubber for the outside case <EOS> we might as well stick with that um . <EOS>
did we decide on having the ten um the ten numbers <EOS> and then the the little digit next to it which kind of enabled you to put them together . <EOS> right . <EOS> yeah , i think so , <EOS> so zero to nine . <EOS> mm . <EOS> i think nowadays you can just get ones where it gives you a sort of a second or two to press another number , <EOS> so you can press any two <EOS> and it'll sort of put them together . <EOS>
right first time this time . <EOS> nu <EOS> there we go . <EOS> it's not that complicated , <EOS> but i get it wrong every time . <EOS> okay so <EOS> we are just waiting for matthew . <EOS> for matthew , yep . <EOS> mm . <EOS> uh so <EOS> i suggest we start the meeting uh without matthew uh <EOS> he's uh obviously late for some reason . <EOS>
oh , that's erase . <EOS> looks like a ipod . <EOS> oh , <EOS> no . <EOS> no , <EOS> add <EOS> hey , <EOS> but you can erase that . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> that's a bit weird . <EOS> oh , <EOS> now i'm line . <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
no . <EOS> ah . <EOS> yes . <EOS> so welcome to the marketing presentation once again . <EOS> um this time about trendwatching . <EOS> uh well there has been inv investigation again , in the in the remote control market . <EOS> uh it shows a number of developments . <EOS> uh i will address them uh in a moment . <EOS> um fashion watch watchers uh have detected the trends for young public , because that's our public . <EOS> um well <EOS> fruit and vegetables will be will be the most important theme for clothing , uh shoes and furniture . <EOS> and the feel of the material is expected to be spongey . <EOS> so um the developments i will address them <EOS> oh yeah well this is the fruit and vegetables looks of fresh bright colours . <EOS> so to give you an idea . <EOS>
'kay . <EOS> 'kay . <EOS> but can we really afford it <EOS> 'cause it looks like they would be , that would be a really main cost source then <EOS> right ? <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> my estimate is that in order to incorporate touch screen technology it's gonna cost us upwards of seventeen fifty euro per remote , <EOS> yeah <EOS> that's just an estimate though . <EOS>
and the beeper's also inside there too somewhere . <EOS> so you have to have a button on your on your you have to attach the button to the <EOS> yeah <EOS> we didn't design that . <EOS> yeah we have that that has yes yet to be designed . <EOS>
so <EOS> let's see here . <EOS> what if we had what if we had not only um <EOS> say we went with the ball the ball function <EOS> um , but maybe we give it sort of grips along the side s um <EOS> to make it easier to hold on to . <EOS> so you know um s so <EOS> it's easier to hold onto that way . <EOS> course that'll then remove some of our our ball . unless this unless this part were raised , <EOS> so <EOS> say the cover flips over <EOS> and covers that part . <EOS>
oh shoot . <EOS> okay . <EOS> uh just general findings . <EOS> uh what we need uh technically speaking for the remote control is some sort of energy source , uh some sort of user interface , <EOS> which i think we've mostly been talking about the user interface and the design of that . <EOS> um a circuit chip within that to uh control and send the messages and um a sender and receiver . <EOS> and um <EOS> oops . <EOS> uh-huh . <EOS> this is just sort of a little schematic diagram of what we're looking for . <EOS> uh this just kinda represents the energy source <EOS> which feeds into the circuit chip <EOS> uh which maybe then we could have that feed into a switch <EOS> which would send signals f to um a subcomponent and on to a light bulb between <EOS> so it'll light up once we start once you start pressing buttons . <EOS> um also send signals to the um infrared bulb , <EOS> which will be the part that actually what ? sends signals to the the television . <EOS> and then you've got your happy little t_v_ watcher there . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> you can see very clearly now that the uh teletext and options menu isn't uh taking uh much uh uh it's taking much part of the screen , <EOS> so it's very uh <EOS> when you uh when you use it , doesn't uh become irritating to see . <EOS> 'cause if you put it on the top you always get see the the options menu . <EOS>
one one being true , and seven being false . <EOS> okay . <EOS> ouch . <EOS> oops . <EOS> so <EOS> okay . <EOS> do we have a fancy look and feel , according to you ? <EOS> yeah , i think so . <EOS> i think you have nice colours . <EOS> i don't <EOS> the sha the bowl shape people like . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> right . no . <EOS> cut things out . <EOS> but you think it should be one . <EOS> it's meant to be one , yeah , <EOS> i don't know why i put two in there , <EOS> but um <EOS> hold on till i find it , <EOS> i think this shift button might be stuck again . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> but i think it's alright . <EOS> we achieved uh project goal i think . <EOS> yeah <EOS> that is within the budget . <EOS> de <EOS> it's w <EOS> yes , more or less . <EOS> mm . <EOS> and the evaluation was <EOS> without without l_c_d_ , without speech recognition , it will be simple . <EOS>
trendy , s and i say specifically spongy fruity . <EOS> oh yes . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> well , <EOS> maybe only a two or a three then , <EOS> 'cause it's no <EOS> we still haven't decided about specific sponginess or specific <EOS> we have the worry about how robust it will be if it's it's curved as a banana but spongy . <EOS> i think <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
um <EOS> i couldn't think of any other , 'specially not for t_v_ . <EOS> just on the front as well . <EOS> no , <EOS> that's the only th the only thing you need . <EOS> is <EOS> uh uh the p uh next and previous . <EOS> previous i know , <EOS> but next channel ? <EOS> i don't thi <EOS>
your username . <EOS> what's your username and password ? <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> sorry . <EOS> okay . <EOS> there we go . <EOS> okay . <EOS> excellent . <EOS> right . <EOS> hopefully that's us ready to uh to go . <EOS> so . <EOS> functional design meeting . <EOS> we'll have to flesh out some of the uh stuff . um <EOS> we'll start with the minutes of the last meeting . <EOS> not a lot thankfully to say . <EOS> we introduced ourselves , <EOS> discussed the possibility of a macro facility , interac interacting the t_v_ a bit more , um mentioning of bar-code , joystick for user manipulation , um and ergonomics of the remote control as well . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> the battery and that i think that the chip takes the data and presents it well , without sort of scattering . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> so 's just the quality of the chip . <EOS> yeah . i think so . <EOS> okay . <EOS> the quality uh quality of all the components really , <EOS> i mean , we can't really do anything shoddy work , <EOS> 'cause it's <EOS>
okay . <EOS> for the <EOS> so you have that button , <EOS> that so there's <EOS> is there a light or shall we leave just have a radio ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> um on the t_v_ or on the phone ? <EOS> um it seemed like a a beep seemed the most reasonable to me , <EOS> i think that's what the phone has , <EOS> i mean when you need to find your phone , you just have someone call it and it starts ringing somewhere and then you can figure out that it's in the couch or wherever . <EOS>
oh yeah . <EOS> twenty million . <EOS> two million , oh yeah , two million . yeah . <EOS> we can sell our r remotes to . <EOS> at least that uh countries which have uh a television . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> um so <EOS> now it's time uh for us to uh going uh to discuss a little uh things . <EOS> you can think about uh experience with a remote control uh yourself , at home . <EOS> what you think might be uh a useful uh new feature . <EOS> what uh what can distinguish our new trendy remote control from all the others . <EOS> um so uh <EOS> let's uh let's uh discuss a little . <EOS> i'm gonna join you at the table . <EOS>
so <EOS> so <EOS> i hope you're ready for this uh functional design meeting . <EOS> of course . <EOS> um so <EOS> i will take the minutes <EOS> you mm you three are going to do presentation . <EOS> um uh we want to know to at the end to know the new project's requirement <EOS> so <EOS> we need uh to know the the user uh needs <EOS> that we want to fulfil to fulfil the from the technical part <EOS> we want to know how it going to work <EOS> and um <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> shall i just prepare it now ? <EOS> yeah , just prepare one now . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> it will be red , too . <EOS> cool . okay . <EOS> so , be attractive to look at . <EOS> that's this one . <EOS> what do you all say ? <EOS>
no that is a scroll wheel itself , it'll be put in that . <EOS> huh . <EOS> no no . <EOS> we have two scroll , and we have three push buttons . <EOS> ah okay , okay . <EOS> uh . <EOS> okay , okay . <EOS> actually whe whe when you wrote regular chip you should put two , because there is another chip here . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah , they they can change . <EOS> mm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> and uh you don't y you don't need to discuss about the projects , <EOS> you f more need about th to discuss about where is the printer , how do i get furniture , i'm i don't have a a pencil , where is the the box with the pencils , and so on . <EOS> this is not project related . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> or a different style . <EOS> then there we probably have been creative . <EOS> i think we uh discussed a lot of things about it . so <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> we could make a lot of different uh remote controls . <EOS> so it's creativity . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> uh a diode , a transistor , a resonator , <EOS> these are all this uh technical uh electri electronic compons uh components which are which we have to use in a remote controller . <EOS> a battery <EOS> uh , i would like to suggest one thing <EOS> uh if we <EOS> uh if we will be able to make a res rechargeable battery then we sh we need not go for a high performance battery , <EOS> even if it is a low performance battery it ca it can't l it can't charge much . <EOS> it it it's not a high voltage battery . <EOS> then also we can if it is a rechargeable one , then uh people can use it for a long time , <EOS> so in that way we can cut cut the cost , but w uh uh that we have to make the battery as rechargeable one . <EOS>
to user . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so that it easy and fast . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> so you should have that one on . <EOS> uh yeah , think so . <EOS> our main targets' age are ? were ? forty five plus , or ? <EOS>
well maybe it could be a universal design . <EOS> a universal design , which is which is good for both the hands . <EOS> yeah ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> still shaped for yeah for your hand but not for a particular hand , right ? <EOS> that's right , whether it's left hand or right hand , <EOS> but but don't you think that the two points are clashing , one thing you are saying design should fit the hand shape and it should not be very small ? <EOS>
t the the main c the main character ? <EOS> wow . <EOS> the guy . yeah . <EOS> is he a wanker ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> very much so . <EOS> hell of a soccer player <EOS> but a total bastard nonetheless . <EOS> he looks really tall , <EOS> like he's gotta be like six six . <EOS> yeah . um okay so <EOS> i really like jeff buckley . <EOS> you guys heard of jeff buckley ? <EOS> um that's cool <EOS> 'cause like not very many people have . <EOS> um and um oh well <EOS> i might as well throw a british person in there <EOS> um you can't go wrong with radiohead . <EOS> it's a r <EOS>
okay . <EOS> uh yeah . <EOS> well <EOS> solar may not be so good when you're watching t_v_ in the night , <EOS> but <EOS> mm . <EOS> well <EOS> it is just so annoying how <EOS> it would have to sor store up the energy <EOS> mm . yeah . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> that's kind of a good thing though , <EOS> you know , <EOS> give the rest of us some structure to work with so hey . <EOS> i felt like i slipped into it a lot . <EOS> it's kinda fun . <EOS> i dunno . <EOS> an <EOS> so <EOS> is that the first time you've taken on that kind of role ? <EOS>
mm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> uh-huh . <EOS> alright . <EOS> you know , so something heading towards that , <EOS> so it's not overly <EOS> i mean i don't know what h most of the buttons do on my remote controls , <EOS> so i figure how many do you need , you know ? <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> it's better for <EOS> special form , <EOS> yeah , they're a special form there in shapes and stuff . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> i mean , these these ones on the side are curved kind of , so <EOS> and special material . <EOS>
two ? <EOS> yeah , participant two um <EOS> working ? <EOS> yeah , working design , <EOS> so . <EOS> so <EOS> i think <EOS> i can <EOS> can you go to the next one ? <EOS> i uh <EOS> it's not this one . <EOS> it's uh oth the oth so i <EOS> it's the working design . <EOS> sorry . <EOS>
alright . fair enough . <EOS> we're good ? <EOS> sounds good . <EOS> i'm gonna save th a copy of this in case you guys need any reminders . <EOS> i'm gonna save a copy of this <EOS> and the minutes that i'll do it in a second <EOS> and put them in the shared folder for later reference . <EOS>
yeah , <EOS> i'd like push buttons with <EOS> so <EOS> push buttons <EOS> okay , um <EOS> that's that . <EOS> no we can't , actually . <EOS> no , <EOS> um this is gonna sound weird , <EOS> but the next meeting starts in thirty minutes . <EOS> whew . <EOS> and they actually want a look and feel design , user interface design , <EOS> you can look and see this as well as i can . <EOS> marketing they want product evaluation . <EOS>
okay . cool . <EOS> okay and then how do i press the the big one , to get it on to the big <EOS> yeah . <EOS> uh f_ five . <EOS> f_ five <EOS> and i press that again to get it off as well do i ? <EOS>
yeah , <EOS> let's leave it as zero , 'cause it's easy . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> you might end up having to take off the sample sensor . <EOS> we we're definitely going to have to <EOS> so we've got pushbutton , <EOS> and then we've <EOS>
right . <EOS> well okay , <EOS> here's the here's the thing on the chips that i that i got . <EOS> um simple , regular , advanced chip on print . <EOS> the chip on print includes an infrared sensor , <EOS> so we don't have to worry about that . <EOS> um , 'kay , <EOS> the pushbutton <EOS> if we're gonna have pushbuttons , they require a simple chip , <EOS> but a scroll wheel requires a regular chip , <EOS> and an l_c_d_ requires advanced . <EOS> do we want a scroll wheel , <EOS> or do we just want pushbuttons ? <EOS>
four arrows . <EOS> yeah , okay , <EOS> but um <EOS> maybe it's still still a good idea , i'm not sure . <EOS> you'll also have to use a mute button <EOS> to to <EOS> yeah , a mute button . yes . <EOS> don't think so . <EOS>
crocodile ? <EOS> gonna be a bird . <EOS> is it gonna be <EOS> it's gonna be a bird . <EOS> o <EOS> that's lovely . <EOS> yeah and uh i'll have to think on the spot of uh things that it is . um <EOS> beauti that's <EOS> uh scary , <EOS> uh strong , <EOS> yeah that's about it i think . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yes we did . <EOS> yeah . n we we can't really do that because for example on the banana theme we can't have it as being yellow . <EOS> it won't stand out . <EOS> so n it's not always gonna be the same colour . <EOS>
yeah , <EOS> but you don't have t have to use the button on the right . <EOS> you can touch it . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> you can touch it . <EOS> it said bo both the options . <EOS> you you can touch options . <EOS> yeah , okay , <EOS> but you have y then you have here s written option on here , the teletext button , <EOS> right ? <EOS> okay , then okay , good . <EOS> then i think also two , yeah . <EOS>
to have a <EOS> you s you speak about with voi voice control ? <EOS> no no no no , <EOS> i say <EOS> yeah <EOS> standard uh standard remote control takes maybe uh one month to to do that . <EOS> standard button one . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so the only time problem is the sp voice recognition . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> touchscreen . <EOS> uh i seen uh w uh something on the internet uh not today but uh a few uh weeks ago . <EOS> uh you got uh yeah quite an uh a kind of uh touchscreen um and it's uh for uh twenty uh euros or uh less uh . <EOS> so it's possible . <EOS>
oh <EOS> should we maybe make a decision about what features we actually want to include , <EOS> 'cause we've thrown a lot of features onto the table , <EOS> but <EOS> yeah . <EOS> do we actually want to incorporate all of them , <EOS> or have we missed anything ? <EOS>
okay . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> three . <EOS> ten . <EOS> can we stay here ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> ten . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> uh . <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah , alright . <EOS> why can't we stay here ? <EOS> alright . <EOS>
yeah , yeah . <EOS> mm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so you'd have to have like <EOS> i think you would have to have like a function switch button , <EOS> you know somewhere so like you can you're either on t_v_ , you're on d_v_d_ or you're on v_c_r_ , or you're like . so <EOS>
and then the desired devi design will consist in uh specifically implementing and detailing the choice we've uh made in the second point . <EOS> so i will now ask you which is very important for the design of a new remote control for to uh each of us to to draw uh your favourite animal on the white board . <EOS>
yeah , you can navigate . uh . <EOS> i think that wou that would be quite hard to learn to use it . <EOS> no <EOS> , i'm not not convinc . <EOS> let's go th for <EOS> i think it would be a t yeah , two . <EOS> now lower . <EOS>
no , because y you can easily put a microphone on the side that would have no problem would haven't been not be damaged or anything , and it'd be accessible all the time to voice . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yes . yeah . <EOS> yeah , exactly . <EOS>
um maybe for the younger market . <EOS> um i think they've got their own controls in this kind of like hidden panel . <EOS> yeah i suppose if we've got their if they've got their own controls then we can avoid it for ours just to keep it simple . <EOS>
yeah <EOS> and just have the colour match or something . <EOS> yeah . 'cause yeah no-one wants to hold a remote that's uncomfortable obviously . <EOS> mm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> or like <EOS> i dunno , <EOS> some of 'em you can kind of think see as like <EOS>
yeah , <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah , cool . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> that sounds <EOS> okay , yeah , yeah . <EOS> um i'm just i'm suddenly realising that yeah we're discussing how much how good it's gonna be to change channels <EOS> t <EOS> we still can just tell it to . <EOS> i mean are we are we starting to get away from the the voice functionality of it ? <EOS>
yeah ? <EOS> oh right , <EOS> so you can <EOS> oh , yeah alright . <EOS> so <EOS> you can adjust which buttons you want on that s screen . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> if you want to adjust , like for example , adjust the audio settings , you press audio on the touchscreen <EOS> and you get the buttons for audio settings , <EOS> so the other buttons are gone . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> that's cool . <EOS> mm-hmm , <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> that's cool . <EOS> okay , cool . <EOS> um <EOS> well hmm . <EOS> speech recognition i take it <EOS> oh it's <EOS> i don't , i've <EOS> i know of no products um that use speech recognition well . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> project documents , yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> it gives the na oh . <EOS> yes . <EOS> okay , nice . <EOS> okay , <EOS> thank you . <EOS> the questionnaire , fill in uh we fill out d after lunch or uh <EOS> uh well , <EOS> it's it's simply filling <EOS> oh no , <EOS> it's uh it's also filling out <EOS> no , <EOS> i'd do it after lunch i think . <EOS> i'm hungry , <EOS> so do it after lunch . <EOS> thank you all . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> be what we were told , and they'd say yeah , definitely . <EOS> . <EOS> 'kay . <EOS> okay . <EOS> well , let's see . <EOS> now we get to do the budget numbers . <EOS> you didn't know that you were gonna have a budget . <EOS> but we do . <EOS> okay . <EOS>
yep . <EOS> i think we're all um pretty sussed on that . <EOS> um <EOS> anyone have any questions ? <EOS> everybody happy in their work ? <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah , it seems like we're all on the pretty much on the same page . <EOS> now this is good , <EOS> we've got a good structure going on . <EOS> we all know where we're going to . <EOS> have you been ge has <EOS> have any of you lot been getting loads of crap spam on your computers ? <EOS>
wow . <EOS> this . <EOS> what is the other chip for ? the one on top . <EOS> this <EOS> the one on top is for the um well the functionali the functionalities <EOS> and the the th red um sorry the green one is is to well , putting things together , <EOS> um f transform the data into uh qu into the format to to uh to communicate with the t_v_ set . <EOS>
all together . <EOS> um i dunno . <EOS> i imagine <EOS> that's a good question . <EOS> our sale our sale anyway . <EOS> yeah , okay okay . <EOS> i imagine it probably is our sale actually <EOS> because it's probably up to the the um the retailer to uh sell it for whatever price they want . um . <EOS>
yeah , yeah . <EOS> so do you plug it in the t_ you plug it in t_v_ , this thing ? <EOS> yeah , it'd probably just stick it on your t_v_ <EOS> so if you need to find the remote , click the button . <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay . <EOS>
uh something conceptual , yeah . <EOS> wha what was it again that i was supposed to look into ? <EOS> con components , oh . <EOS> components , <EOS> yeah . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> sorry , <EOS> but um the next meeting um are we going to have it um right after lunch <EOS> or shall we prepare our <EOS>
you you have time some more ? <EOS> yep . <EOS> yes yes you can you can still . we have time . <EOS> okay . <EOS> sure you can you know . <EOS> so <EOS> what i'm gonna present here is very uh um yeah basic knowledge about the all the the components that are inside a a r_c_ a remote control , and how is it manufactured h what is the process , just to explain you . <EOS> so <EOS> the method is ther <EOS> there is a a set of components in a in a remote control <EOS> like , and uh what cost <EOS> the the components in themself do not cost a lot <EOS> but the the way to assemble everything costs obviously , <EOS> and i will uh show you my preferences uh uh at the end . <EOS>
by big brother ? <EOS> okay . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> so <EOS> you must be careful with uh with uh all this . <EOS> and uh as i can see you uh you have placed your laptops uh exactly on the place where it must be . <EOS> and that has to do with the camera settings , <EOS> so we don't have our uh laptops in front of the cameras . <EOS>
mm 'kay <EOS> this doesn't work . <EOS> so yeah function design . <EOS> um you guys know me , pedro , and um what i found is we want to do fashion <EOS> and i think , honestly , we should keep technology low and just simple basically <EOS> and try to aim for design . <EOS> if <EOS> basically a case will will cost the same if it looks good or bad <EOS> so we ma we have to make it look good . <EOS> um something cute and small . <EOS> the big chunky remotes are died in the eighties . <EOS> so we should just go for something that people will like to actually look at . <EOS>
right . <EOS> mm . <EOS> that would be kinda neat . <EOS> terracotta bowl or something . <EOS> mm . <EOS> okay <EOS> still , i mean , yeah , along those lines . <EOS> yeah i like that , i like that idea a lot . <EOS> um , let's see what we can do as far as that goes . <EOS>
yeah , i know i know , my pen vibrates . <EOS> but only for a very short time . <EOS> um <EOS> you know , your pen vibrates ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> so <EOS> looks like we've designed a banana . <EOS> well done , team . <EOS> um we need <EOS> we've just got about ten minutes or so left of the meeting , <EOS> so it would be good if we could just have a little talk about the project itself and how it went , <EOS> um so that we can feed back to the management for next time they're designing a product . <EOS>
but maybe it's <EOS> yeah . <EOS> that's what i meant . <EOS> maybe it's very hard to to make it fold open and to l look like it's very uh uh <EOS> what's it's called ? <EOS> mm . if you if if you make to fold open it's or also an uh the strength uh is not s as good as a normal uh remote control . <EOS>
. <EOS> yeah . so <EOS> i think if sh if my mum saw a remote control like this with only two buttons and a joystick , i mean that'll probably be the first one she decides not to buy , <EOS> you know . <EOS> she'd be like is this a remote control , <EOS> i don't <EOS> how do you use it , and stuff like that . <EOS> so even if it is really user friendly to us , but we're used to using menus all the time . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> ooh . <EOS> the remote <EOS> there are remote controls like that , <EOS> yeah . <EOS> like some t_v_s they have a sort of uh a sliding screen on the remote control of it <EOS> that hides all the complicated buttons . <EOS> so if you wanna do something complicated like programme your television or re-tune it , then you you open up this little hatch or or slide the screen down <EOS> and there's all the all the special buttons . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> s <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so maybe titanium it's not a good idea . <EOS> seems not , seems not . <EOS> we need to think about mm mm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so <EOS> think more of uh something in the colours of uh like fruit and vegetables and spongy , <EOS> as a <EOS> even in the shape it has to be more round and uh
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> and the rest is the company <EOS> the company colour's silver ? <EOS> it was , yeah , silver and yellow . <EOS> it l it looks like <EOS> i don't <EOS> we could promote the banana one . <EOS> like mm . <EOS>
so . <EOS> mm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> you have on the mm on the side here the microphone for the for the speech recognition system here . <EOS> and here the the switch that control if you want <EOS> why you why you you put it in the the side ? <EOS>
mm . hmm . <EOS> i wasn't very keen on that , but yeah . <EOS> huh . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> six seven eight nine . <EOS> i like that . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> and then , well this is on off button . <EOS> it's it's quite standard mm place for it <EOS> and and also the colour is quite often red , <EOS> so it's it's kind of user friendly . <EOS> and then these ones would be for flipping the channels back and <EOS> like the previous one and the next one . <EOS> and and we would also have a l little um thing saying here , previous and ne prevon prevon next . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i think we were <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> considered the re <EOS> yeah . <EOS> written down that it was really there . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i think we were just getting overenthusiastic with the task . <EOS> i think we really got into it , <EOS> i mean i got into it as the day went on <EOS> and i got really like , ooh i'm designing a remote control , <EOS> i dunno if that's just me , <EOS> but <EOS>
that's easy to do with the colours , i think . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> uh . <EOS> yeah we think so too . <EOS> in material yeah rubber , rubber is , <EOS> like i said , young people like more soft materials and spongy ones <EOS> and the old people like plain wood . <EOS> so we have to decide if we're going to use <EOS>
yep . <EOS> and here's the agenda for this meeting . <EOS> uh i'm just gonna open , say a few boring words to start with again , and start taking minutes afterwards . <EOS> you guys are gonna give us a presentation of our wonder product <EOS> that i can see some demonstrations of over there . <EOS> looks cool . <EOS> and then we're gonna evaluate it . <EOS> then we're gonna talk about finance , <EOS> and i've got a lovely excel spreadsheet that i knocked up in the last five minutes for this . <EOS> and uh <EOS> yep . <EOS> and we're gonna evaluate the product and close . <EOS> got forty minutes to do this in . <EOS> we should be fine . <EOS> let's try and keep this one on schedule . <EOS> so <EOS>
yeah , then then we would be in the b budget . <EOS> yeah b <EOS> no no , <EOS> you can push this one , <EOS> but we don't have a pushbutton uh we ca we don't have this muting mechanism for this scrolling thing . <EOS> but that's well you would just have to to spin it down . <EOS>
i think so , yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> we have to have something that will change people's thinking to identify this as advantageous , <EOS> and i don't know what that is . <EOS> it's gotta be low-cost or high-cost with with special design features . <EOS> well i'd be inclined to say , if we can make the design better than any comparable remote while reducing the cost , then that's the way we really should play it . <EOS>
it is . i think it is . <EOS> he only does it after he's had his dinner <EOS> and um he'll just all of a sudden just get up and start chasing his tail 'round the living room . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> it's an after dinner dog then . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> but <EOS> i suppose we need we need to find out what circuit board that requires , maybe before we m make a decision . <EOS> but the way that i interpret that um it doesn't seem to send out a signal to the telly , <EOS> it just <EOS> it's like a parrot just rep reply replying to your message . <EOS> so i don't think it would effect our circuit board . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> and the key issue here is , is being trendy and original . <EOS> um , that does not necessarily mean it needs to be outrageous . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> right . <EOS> okay we have five minutes left . <EOS> so , just to cover <EOS> we have one more thing . <EOS> um , like you can go over your ideas , of course , in your own personal times . <EOS> um , our next meeting will be in half an hour . <EOS> so you have half an hour to , uh , think about what you want to present . <EOS> or not present but bring to the meeting . <EOS> um , i_d_ , whatever that stands for . <EOS>
so in last meeting we have discussed the conceptual design <EOS> and we asked you to prepare a prototype for the for the remote control . <EOS> okay . <EOS> so . <EOS> so let's see the what did you prepare . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> so can you go out to the shared folder ? <EOS>
okay . <EOS> bye . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm . uh . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> uh do you want a an l_c_d_ with twenty five euros ? <EOS> well , you're the marketing expert you should tell us if it is too much or not . <EOS> well , this is <EOS> i think <EOS> well , according to the to the report people are more interested in in a fa fancy look and feel and in a technological inno in innovation , <EOS> so , i will give more importance to the look and feel than rather than the <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> yes . <EOS> we discussed . <EOS> yeah , yeah , some of them . <EOS> the menus uh are not identical for all th for all t_v_s , <EOS> so you have to display it on one uh t_v_ . <EOS> well <EOS> you can use um when you uh how do you call it , s um synchronized , the um remote and the t_v_ , <EOS> then there's always , there are always uh possibilities to change the colour and the brightness and the volume <EOS> and um well maybe we can look out if there's options that the remote um in its memory can see what kinda t_v_ it is , <EOS> from <EOS> ah , it's a philips , this and this and that , and then give the options that are capable <EOS> the capable from the t <EOS>
yes . <EOS> mm . <EOS> right . <EOS> excellent , mm-hmm . <EOS> so that yeah . <EOS> but just to have that function would be would be really good . <EOS> mm . <EOS> right . <EOS> okay so <EOS> can i just run this past you while it occurs to me , <EOS> i don't mean to quickly jump from one subject to another , <EOS> but just discussing the different age groups and targeting the different age groups it occurs to me , to produce our own mobile phones , that that's kind of what led us on to comparing t_v_ remote controls with with their design features , <EOS> um , chain companies like carphone warehouse , you can pop in anytime with a phone that you bought for them w if you've got any problems with it and they'll fix it , <EOS> they'll phone the company , you can use their telephones . <EOS> is it worthwhile with with our retail outlets having a a similar um kind of service <EOS> so that if older users were deterred from buying this , if they know they can just pop into one of our high street outlets , th you know , which button is it i press for this ? th as free as a free aspect of our service , would that not make it more attractive to them ? <EOS>
uh i just had a thought actually , <EOS> sorry to interrupt . <EOS> uh you were saying about um it could technical problems of like uh someone on the television saying a channel number and it changed <EOS> we could maybe have like an activation <EOS> do , please . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS>
yeah yeah . <EOS> so this is so this is this is much more than tak taking this technology , bringing it to the remote control and using it . <EOS> so this is out of discussion . <EOS> so if if if it is something that you can we can bring easily and to put it into the banana remote control <EOS>
hm-hmm . <EOS> because you have no idea how to get in , <EOS> but the designers thought they were great . <EOS> okay , <EOS> so we need to wrap it up now , <EOS> so that we can go away and get on with some of this . <EOS> um we've got another meeting in thirty minutes , <EOS> so <EOS> you're <EOS> you'll be getting specific instructions once you go back to your workspace , <EOS> but im basically you're looking at the working design , <EOS>
no , <EOS> uh i think <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i think it's s so simple <EOS> you just <EOS> i dunno . <EOS> okay . <EOS> so <EOS> but that's for that's for you , <EOS> 'cause it's <EOS> yeah , okay i'll d i'll take a look at it . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> i don't know what other options there are . <EOS> i think we're getting <EOS> that's true . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> could <EOS> i mean , you could hold it in your left hand and d use your index finger . <EOS> but there's not really any other options unless it's like a keyboard . <EOS> so , i think we did as as much as you can with a remote control . <EOS>
and on what the have said and the market research and stuff probably looking at something that should be user-centred . <EOS> fewer buttons , <EOS> simpler to use , <EOS> and if ten percent um is hidden away <EOS> if ten percent is what's used , <EOS> maybe the other fifty percent , the buttons that are used very rarely like programming , they could be hidden maybe <EOS> under <EOS> some remote controls you might have come across have maybe a little flip thi thing where they're hidden away . <EOS> and the main buttons are the ones you or the ones you come across . <EOS> um and finally , um uh <EOS> sort i've sort of covered that , <EOS> our product i think should be user interface orientated . um <EOS> like i said to concentrate on t_v_ remote control , <EOS> a universal remote might be too complex . <EOS> um <EOS> and as what it , <EOS> the major findings market researchers have said , it's the image and the appearance that people di dislike . <EOS> so that we should concentrate on something that would set a trend . <EOS> and then and change the fashion of remote controls .
so are are <EOS> poor little thing . <EOS> that was bound to happen <EOS> oh , sad . <EOS> mm 'kay , <EOS> congratulations . <EOS> um . anything else to say ? <EOS> nothing will come up until after our meeting's supposed to be over , <EOS> its all timed . <EOS>
and it not a lot uh <EOS> no , the first one . <EOS> i didn't know uh <EOS> no , <EOS> w i didn't know <EOS> yeah , <EOS> like i with with the remote <EOS> and i never new we have t we had to uh yeah made a made a rec a remote control . <EOS>
so <EOS> what do you think of only the numbers and the on-off button or <EOS> yeah , <EOS> i have it on the next page . <EOS> but yes uh basic functions like numbers and that sort of stuff . <EOS> um so <EOS> the options that we put on there should be easy to use , <EOS> and 'cause you have more room then , <EOS> and for elderly people big buttons . <EOS> uh an icon on it or text on it , <EOS> so it's very clear what that buttons does . <EOS> so it doesn't take much time to figure out uh how to use it . <EOS>
yeah , if you're changing your mind . <EOS> fine to coarse . <EOS> fine to coarse . <EOS> and from ten to ten channels here . <EOS> yeah , yeah . <EOS> y one to ten , ten to twelve , uh ten to t uh twenty . ten to twenty <EOS> and this one , t one two three four five six , like this . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i think you can do it both ways . <EOS> you can have it so it's easy they can pick it up and use it straight away without doing anythi without customizing it , <EOS> or if they want to they have the option of using these extra features . <EOS>
i don't know , what do you think ? <EOS> it just said , for t_v_ only . <EOS> but i mean , general t_v_ controls do do video as well . <EOS> would that imply video use ? <EOS> t yeah yeah . <EOS> i d well i dunno 'cause uh the w if you've g <EOS>
but you got a base . <EOS> do you think people'll really go for that though ? <EOS> because <EOS> it's useful for the remote phone . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> would that add to our costs at all , i wonder ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i would think so , because you'd have to develop a base . <EOS>
do we think w s in the in the wrong folder maybe ? <EOS> it is possible . <EOS> you put it on <EOS> no . <EOS> it was somewhere in something like this . <EOS> i don't remember the name actually <EOS> must be something like messenger ami or something . <EOS>
oh . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah i think we have a a winning product . <EOS> okay . <EOS> evaluation . <EOS> oh we've been writing this up for m months . <EOS> i think it went quite smoothly . <EOS> uh room for creativity , were we happy with that ? <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so <EOS> um <EOS> was there <EOS> so on the top there is volume and <EOS> and channel , <EOS> which is so you could just go like that without thinking about it , like <EOS> a channel . <EOS> channel up volume up . <EOS> okay cool . <EOS>
no . <EOS> um , <EOS> no . <EOS> okay . <EOS> okay we i think we have problem . <EOS> l_c_ display , maybe . interface . <EOS> i think we s if we keep on adding things <EOS> so we have to <EOS> it's okay . fine . <EOS>
oh . <EOS> try again . <EOS> okay . <EOS> this is going to be a heavily interactive evaluation , <EOS> and the method here is to evaluate the new remote control in terms of the user requirements and the hot trends introduced by the marketing department . <EOS> so , <EOS> this means we're going to go over the priorities that were raised by uh the consumers <EOS> a as well as incorporate all of our insight into this uh evaluation exercise . <EOS> so <EOS> i'm going to go and use the whiteboard , <EOS> and i've made a list of criteria to look at , <EOS> and so i'm gonna i'm gonna leave this up as the last thing , <EOS> but for the evaluation it's going to be one is true and seven is false , going over these different criteria , <EOS> so <EOS> one true seven false <EOS> and i'm gonna now use the um the board . <EOS> okay . so um <EOS> fancy , technologically innovative , easy to use , trendy , buttons , excess buttons , good buttons , ugly , sellable , and other . <EOS> and in fact i hope that uh you all introduce some additional terms , <EOS> because these are things that um have been brought up , <EOS> some of them seem rather close , <EOS> like they overlap . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> alright . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> that c <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah <EOS> uh . <EOS> use all the ones at the same time . <EOS> you didn't have six remote controls sitting in front of you . right . <EOS>
hmm . <EOS> play-doh s <EOS> huh . <EOS> huh . <EOS> really ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> did they ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> play-doh . <EOS> no , it's true , yeah . <EOS> guess i'd forgot how good s play-doh smells . <EOS>
great . <EOS> so <EOS> okay , i think this is <EOS> although you don't wanna cut uh cut women out of the uh potential buyers though , <EOS> do you ? <EOS> so <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah <EOS> they are the most t_v_ watcher . <EOS> so we should be careful . <EOS>
how long is the meeting ? <EOS> this meeting it's not very long . it's uh probably down to about thirty five minutes now . <EOS> so i want each of your presentations to not be too long , five five minutes , something like that . <EOS> um if you haven't done a powerpoint thingy , it doesn't matter , <EOS> it it just it just says that you it's <EOS> that's just one particular medium . <EOS> if you haven't had time to prepare one , you can draw stuff on the noteboard , <EOS> you can talk to us , <EOS> you can you know however you want to do your little presentation , basically , you can . <EOS>
yes . <EOS> i guess we have to define what what we're aiming for . <EOS> if it's just a television then that it's a bit simpler , <EOS> 'cause there's less buttons that would even need to be on it . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> it's an idea with the buttons being really . <EOS>
but we have to use the solar cell . <EOS> otherwise not . <EOS> so but <EOS> uh like <EOS> but using how many batteries , for example ? <EOS> are are what maybe what is the size of the battery <EOS> yeah i was thinking just common a_a_ cells . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> yeah i've seen <EOS> and are these like uh <EOS> what are the life of the kinetic battery , <EOS> it like it runs for long time ? <EOS> um yeah <EOS> it's <EOS> it charges into um some form of <EOS> it's a smaller cell which it charges into and uh the si the size sort of a watch a watch battery , <EOS> 'cause they use them quite frequently in watches . <EOS> and that'll that would l would last for um <EOS> well i do i d i'm not entirely sure how long it would last but i've never seen one run out . <EOS>
right . <EOS> um so can we have updates from everyone from what you've worked <EOS> on just kind of a quick summary of anything interesting that you'd like to share or discuss in this <EOS> sure . <EOS> and i can start if you want . mm . <EOS> is there an order ? <EOS> no . <EOS> we haven't decided on an order . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> a pointer ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> so <EOS> just to touch on m my point one last time that i had brought up . <EOS> um i really <EOS> un unless you guys are die-hard against the fact that um it's possible like it reduces the usability of the remote b and the fact that you can't lose it on your own , i think it still might be a good idea to investigate having like a power cradle . <EOS>
cool . <EOS> you don't have to hurry , <EOS> we've got plenty of time . <EOS> okay . <EOS> so , my name's cat <EOS> and i'm really not very good at this whole drawing malarkey <EOS> so um <EOS> okay . <EOS> it's got no eyes . <EOS> oh , good point . <EOS> ah , the eyes always ruin it . <EOS> right . <EOS> okay , what do it's eyes like ? <EOS> okay , cool . <EOS> um this is a rabbit . <EOS>
mm 'kay . <EOS> well let's get a product then . <EOS> so now <EOS> if you if you give me if you give me a cut-out of what everybody else has then i need to i need to find a lower cost . <EOS> so our big questions here really are cradle or not cradle ? <EOS> do we go basic or do we go for features ? <EOS> uh d does anyone really wanna do anything with the scroll wheel or should we ditch that off-hand first ? <EOS>
'cause it <EOS> we could've picked a lot of features that would've made it really <EOS> yeah . <EOS> i i would say that it's <EOS> yeah , <EOS> like fancy versus creative it's it's different . <EOS> but does that equal innovative ? <EOS> i dunno . <EOS> i'll give it a three . <EOS>
makes sense . <EOS> uh . <EOS> um but we wanna try to make it for twelve fifty . <EOS> so we wanna try to make a hundred percent profit on it if we can . <EOS> um s right so um <EOS> just to close up , <EOS> i'm not sure how much time i've used <EOS> mm next time right project manager , sorted . <EOS> um . <EOS> is <EOS> uh we'll meet in another half an hour or so <EOS> um and i'd like the um industrial designer to get ge think about what needs to be done , like what the basic function of it . <EOS> um u_i_d_ well yeah you right g your assignments are up there <EOS> and you'll also get s assignments from in your email as well more spec specifics on what do do . <EOS> um mm basic and um so <EOS> i need you to tell us what um we what the user's gonna want . <EOS> so <EOS> actually in a way you guys c maybe in our next meeting chat a bit about what the user's gonna want and what the user can have , <EOS> you know like uh so <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> right . okay . <EOS> 'kay . <EOS> so maybe just a simple push button , <EOS> and that would cut costs on the <EOS> so . so we're going for p okay . <EOS> so is um <EOS> so are we going for the w are we going for the simple one , are we ? <EOS>
so , <EOS> good morning , everyone . <EOS> um <EOS> welcome at uh at the kick off meeting of our uh latest project . <EOS> i hope you all have been uh updated about it . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> good . <EOS> so . yes . <EOS> so <EOS> w we will try to structure this uh meeting with an a with an agenda uh as presented here . <EOS> um after the opening we will tr get acquainted to each other . <EOS> see what our roles are in this project . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> that's true <EOS> but um i don't think there are many t_v_s that can switch channels that fast . <EOS> and so you would need like the t_v_ would need an a function where you can actually view all channels and scroll through it . <EOS> and i dunno if many channels would do have that . if many t_v_s have that . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> no , <EOS> an l_c_d_ screen's just like uh like a drawn here . <EOS> um just uh displays several buttons , <EOS> for example um if you wanted the minimal uh use b uh buttons , such as channel and volume , you just h uh displays four buttons on the screen <EOS> and it's possible to p uh press them down , just like a touch screen . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> what we can change is to propose the customers with skins . <EOS> for example the i the mobile phones nowaday , they sell different kinds of skin <EOS> and then people just feel that oh i have a new skin and looks better . <EOS> yeah , yeah that's right . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> yeah <EOS> i've heard <EOS> i've seen the bar-code design before , <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah , <EOS> it's it's taken out the <EOS> y you don't have to be uh really clever to use a remote control . <EOS> i think for gaming , you know you want you want some big buttons for up , down , left and right , shoot . <EOS>
um . ha hang on <EOS> let me catch up . <EOS> mm yeah . <EOS> 'kay . <EOS> did we finalise what buttons we're including <EOS> or we just everything that we said before ? <EOS> i think there will be time for that later . <EOS> i'm guessing . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> also in in height ? <EOS> yeah okay . <EOS> okay so what we have to decide is what kind of components do we use ? <EOS> uh energy source , chip type , case type . and user interface . <EOS> but i didn't see a clear distinction between these so i think what we have is okay . <EOS> so we only , we already decided that kinetic would be the choice for energy . <EOS> uh the case would be doubly curved . so <EOS>
mm . <EOS> big , round body , really skinny legs <EOS> and they've got a long tail <EOS> and a long face . <EOS> it's eating . <EOS> it looks like eeyore . <EOS> and there is some grass there . <EOS> so this is what i like about cows <EOS> that they just keeps sitting there eating grass , <EOS> they do not disturb anybody um <EOS> they're kind of buddhist in a way . <EOS> so yeah , i like cows . <EOS> um <EOS> my my role in the project is um uh the industrial designer , <EOS> so i'm supposed to design all the details of of the product um <EOS> ho how it works <EOS> and whatever it'll mm take during the functional role , <EOS> what are the various functions that have to be performed by it uh during the um conceptual design , <EOS> what are the various components of it <EOS> and um finally , <EOS> i'm not too sure what was the last part . <EOS> um the detailed design , <EOS> i i guess it will again be the identification of the components and how they integrate with each other . <EOS>
oh , okay , yeah . <EOS> yeah <EOS> i was thinking of getting a cover for <EOS> that <EOS> see i was thinking this s <EOS> sorry <EOS> i was thinking this bit here would be the cover and like that's your actual thing . <EOS> and like this you could have like you could have like cherries and things around there . <EOS> um but <EOS>
i bet having different colours is a lot cheaper than having different shapes too . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> which is why printing might be like just printing the fruit on fruit . <EOS> hmm . <EOS> mm . <EOS> not really <EOS> well we've done finance evaluation criteria , production evaluation . <EOS> um so project evaluation . <EOS>
right . <EOS> uh . <EOS> um so um . <EOS> how th <EOS> this voice operation thing is i think is a good idea um assuming that it's doable , um at least for the basic controls , <EOS> maybe we can balance it that way , you know we can see . <EOS> okay <EOS> you can't say record alias tonight at seven p_m_ <EOS> but we might be able to say um volume up . <EOS>
do y do you wanna sit in the the line of sight of this um <EOS> yeah okay . <EOS> let me just get this going first . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> ah there it is . <EOS> it takes a second , doesn't it ? <EOS> 'kay , that should be it . <EOS> okay um i guess the same thing again , i started with something very basic . <EOS> so just so you guys have some idea of what's involved in my process , <EOS> um and then you can just work through it <EOS> and we 'll either modify it or start from scratch um depending on what your needs are . <EOS>
sure . yeah , yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> sure . <EOS> yeah they they emanate a light through it . <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah <EOS> but because the case is transparent so it gives it a little bit of a glow , doesn't make it freaky . <EOS>
okay . <EOS> so <EOS> and the next slide , <EOS> it is the last one <EOS> it's so it's <EOS> i think it should be wire wireless re remote con <EOS> because you know , it's easier to manage <EOS> and you know because you f the b the the battery problem can hold you know will you use a battery or the a wire to connected you . <EOS> or maybe some kind of thing that we can have both , <EOS> but you know , i at my side prefer a wireless . <EOS>
ma matthew ? <EOS> uh ? <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> so <EOS> you got a lot of room here . <EOS> you can probably reach . <EOS> maybe <EOS> oh <EOS> y <EOS> it's not for that . <EOS> no ? <EOS> no . <EOS> i hope you have some space in your uh the horse of uh mael . <EOS>
if you go by channel , you don't have to do that . <EOS> but uh i i think i i if you if you want to to make uh well a a big jump but uh well you you have to to have a a a device when you could you could <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> as a banana . <EOS> i think that many of us are abstract enough to look at the yellow one and say we'll call it the banana . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> and of the two i really like i m i like the banana , <EOS> but i i do like the chunk . <EOS>
uh , i think i would give it a two . <EOS> okay , <EOS> i gave it a three , <EOS> two , <EOS> yeah ? <EOS> three . <EOS> i'll give three . <EOS> uh maybe two , <EOS> yeah . <EOS> two , okay . <EOS> and the next is functionality <EOS> where i i admit i was a little hard on our team here , but <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> so <EOS> this type should be better for you <EOS> or better should prevent repetitive strain injury a bit . <EOS> easier ? <EOS> and the double curved s looks something like this i guess . <EOS> mm . <EOS> so <EOS> th those are the three options we have . <EOS>
okay uh , let's take like this . <EOS> let's proceed with this model , okay , for the for the marketing direction , okay . <EOS> so no more changes will be made , okay , in this the basic design . <EOS> okay ? <EOS> so we will introduce m this model and uh let's introduce in the market <EOS> and let's take the feedback from the customers , then we can uh go for the <EOS>
mm . <EOS> mm yeah . <EOS> we're just saying volume . <EOS> should volume be important in the joystick , do you think ? <EOS> yeah , <EOS> i think that's <EOS> we could use say the left and right for changing channels <EOS> and the up and down for volume , <EOS> and <EOS>
alright so at top , i don't know if you guys can read that or not . <EOS> i can't 'cause i don't have my glasses on , <EOS> but so we've got the energy source . <EOS> there's uh four , five , six categories . <EOS> we have energy source , electronics , case . <EOS> then we have case material supplements , interface type , and then button supplements . <EOS>
fair enough . <EOS> trying to fill in some time there . <EOS> uh h what did you think of our project process ? <EOS> i think we did <EOS> yeah i think we did quite well . um <EOS> great . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> good . <EOS> good teamwork . <EOS>
uh yeah automatic speech recognition . <EOS> is that in this one though ? <EOS> is this 'cause this is the <EOS> no , <EOS> we ha <EOS> th th there were different options we discussed then , <EOS> we discussed the one that was in budget and the one that was out of budget . <EOS>
first of all i want to ask uh mister ed about your uh marketing plan and your product plan and uh <EOS> well i think that we'll see that throughout the day in how we're going to put this together as a marketing to to market the product . <EOS> we'll have to see on a through discussion on where we're gonna go from here and from with this . <EOS>
exactly . <EOS> okay . and my personal p uh preference is uh , as i said , uh just putting this buttons in a special places <EOS> and covered some buttons which are not used uh that much like settings button , like mobile phone . <EOS> usually some mobile phone cover the dialling number part , <EOS> so we can cover these buttons which are not used or uh number buttons for the for the for the can channels , <EOS> and just put uh volume change or s ch can uh channel change buttons uh uh in the remote control . <EOS> and if the user needed to do some more complex task uh he he can open the cover and then change settings or something like this . <EOS> uh . and also uh i think if we put some some some some some buttons inside of the remote control it can be used easier . <EOS> not on remote control . <EOS> i dunno if i can explain well . <EOS> but uh just inside . <EOS> for example , a sliding or rolling uh uh d uh stuff , if we put it inside then we can easily manipulate with uh thumb . <EOS> so it can be another uh preference . <EOS> and uh i dunno but uh i think usage of a speech recogn uh r recogniser can be good . <EOS> i know that it consumes lots of energy , <EOS> but if we do it in some way that it asleeps when there is no sound and when it detects some sound it may consume less energy . <EOS> and i think it's good because it's something new and usually young people like something new . <EOS> so it may not be very useful but because it's new , people may buy it . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> yeah , that's right . <EOS> i think my laptop is a bit <EOS> etchy . <EOS> i just made a a simple uh presentation . <EOS> so you put some things in it . <EOS> okay . <EOS> how does this work ? <EOS> i dunno . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> okay . i'll think of that . <EOS> mm okay . <EOS> so . <EOS> so ? <EOS> i think that's all . <EOS> meeting's over ? <EOS> great . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> thank you . <EOS> thank you . <EOS> thank you everybody . <EOS>
the remote away . <EOS> mm . hmm . mm . yeah , okay . <EOS> yeah . well yeah , <EOS> that's the right command . <EOS> and then you have to say uh t_v_ channel one , or something . not just one , <EOS> but <EOS> but <EOS> hmm yeah , t_v_ one . <EOS>
uh what else did i bring with me ? <EOS> probably classical , <EOS> to totally geek it out , <EOS> yeah i think . <EOS> okay yeah yeah . <EOS> and my family guy d_v_d_s <EOS> but we don't need to write that one down . <EOS> well <EOS> yeah . <EOS> oh , <EOS> family guy . <EOS> isn't h has h <EOS> do you watch the new season ? <EOS>
yeah <EOS> but that's maybe mo too much expensive , yeah . <EOS> but uh it can be in uh maybe in an a gradable version , <EOS> but <EOS> mm . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> mm-hmm , mm-hmm , <EOS> so <EOS> yeah . <EOS> wh <EOS> you you know like <EOS> for instance take the ipod . it's a kind of remote control . <EOS> uh it's white <EOS> and it's so white that you see it from any anywhere . <EOS> it has this distinctive look and feel and look <EOS> which people seems to like <EOS> just because it's a colour that we don't usually see in a remote control . white . <EOS>
so it sounds <EOS> technically speaking , it's not as advanced , but it does the job , too . <EOS> so , why would we not go for that ? <EOS> if it's something that's inside the the unit . i it doesn't affects whether the customer's gonna buy it or not . <EOS> um we wanna go for an i i all <EOS> so long as it works , <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> or you can always go to google and type in banana remote control . <EOS> flip . vibrate <EOS> . and uh yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> that vibrates <EOS> yeah , but that would just come up with like other things really wouldn't it . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> but um <EOS> yeah , <EOS> but um but actually if you if you imagine not entire the completely same task given to us but us said okay , first thing we have to do is come up with um let's say um a design concept , <EOS> and we sit here together and do it , <EOS> well that's what teamwork is . <EOS> to s to say okay go off and don't talk to each other , it's actually p sort of predisposes you to quite the contrary of teamwork . <EOS> um not that we haven't done i think the best we could have done . <EOS> i'm not dissatisfied with it . <EOS>
do you also do marketing ? <EOS> no . <EOS> so only accounting ? <EOS> accounting , yes . <EOS> okay . <EOS> and ? <EOS> and i'm christine , <EOS> and my role in this uh scenario is to be the industrial designer . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> industrial designer . <EOS>
i think . <EOS> and then ? <EOS> again ? <EOS> yeah . <EOS> you want it to be on both screens , <EOS> or just just yours ? <EOS> no <EOS> i want something else on mine . <EOS> is that possible ? <EOS> yeah <EOS> but i think you have to hit escape . <EOS> and then you can <EOS> yeah . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> i've also known people to have things like like a jewellery watch they wear from time to time , <EOS> and they eventually just say it's just too much of a nuisance because i don't wear it all the time . <EOS> like remote control is similar , you're away on vacation , i dunno whatever , you something , and it just starts to get worn down . <EOS> so we should think about <EOS>
so maybe do y are we thinking something that like s could sit in your hand comfortably , or do you th you'd hold onto comfortably or <EOS> um probably something that s sits in your hand comfortably , sort of feels right in your hand . <EOS> so something quite curvy ? <EOS> okay <EOS> um right okay . <EOS> colour-wise i mean you made a re <EOS> uh was it you <EOS> or uh i can't remember who made the point about how if you've a nice bright colour you'll not lose it , <EOS> was that <EOS>
okay . <EOS> that's definitely something that we should be able to do quite easily . <EOS> i would i would have hoped so anyway . <EOS> i'd say we finish this one up , <EOS> we get started , <EOS> i'll get in , <EOS> i'll write up what we've um kind of quickly done , <EOS> and i'll get that out to everybody . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> um then <EOS> yeah , the must-have buttons would be on off and then the channel numbers <EOS> and then um the one that allows us to go to the next or the previous channel , <EOS> and then volume has to be there . <EOS> but then um other functionalities um could be just <EOS> uh there could be a menu button <EOS> and you could change things on the screen then , <EOS> um for example brightness and mm similar functions could be just um done through the menu . <EOS> and yeah , <EOS> the last question i had about whether we wanted to incorporate n uh more functionalities , <EOS> the answer was already no because of the last minute update . <EOS> so at the for the time being that's uh that's all . <EOS> if you have questions <EOS>
mm . <EOS> lined with numbered buttons and <EOS> mm , yeah . <EOS> okay , <EOS> who <EOS> sorry , <EOS> have you have you finished there andy ? <EOS> yep , yep . <EOS> uh yeah , yeah , that's everything . <EOS> um given that we've already had a extensive discussion uh . <EOS>
yeah . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> okay . <EOS> yeah i'd agree . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> yeah <EOS> but if you if you make it more curved we we can make more and more options for buttons . <EOS> if you have uh it have it in your hand , you you you are not only um yeah you don't need one dimension but you can use other dimensions for pressing the the buttons . <EOS>
s <EOS> yeah . <EOS> mm . <EOS> but if i open it and then save it , probably will be there . <EOS> oh wait , <EOS> never mind <EOS> you can't save it to the <EOS> okay . well <EOS> i'll figure that out in the meantime . <EOS>
silver rubber . <EOS> yeah the the silver black are our main colours . yeah . <EOS> i think we have silver , black <EOS> and between those is like i dunno s five colours between them or something . <EOS> yeah <EOS> w what about a yellow thing , <EOS> i mean it <EOS>
right . <EOS> alright . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> we have six . <EOS> we've got five . <EOS> oh <EOS> six . <EOS> oh <EOS> no , <EOS> five . <EOS> six , with the power . <EOS> six . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> anything else ? <EOS> no . <EOS> oh , <EOS> we'll do we wa <EOS> are the buttons in special colour , <EOS> special f <EOS> i didn't get information on <EOS>
yeah , . <EOS> need a need a calculator for that . <EOS> and that roughly concludes my evaluation of the of the product . <EOS> excellent . <EOS> okay , <EOS> nick the cable back then . <EOS> ooh . <EOS> right <EOS> do um <EOS> i mixed up the colours a little bit . <EOS>
mm-hmm . <EOS> okay . <EOS> mm-hmm . <EOS> okay . <EOS> ge o <EOS> okay . <EOS> so <EOS> we uh we do want latex . <EOS> 'kay . yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> yeah . <EOS> okay . <EOS> latex . <EOS> um and probably in colours , maybe fruity , vegetable colours . <EOS>
mm . <EOS> k yeah . <EOS> so so it's it's not that i'm criticizing the product at all . <EOS> it's just when we eliminate that then what do we bring ? <EOS> what are we bringing in to take the place of this , <EOS> and we have to d in my opinion we have to double up . <EOS> if we lose one we need to bring two or three . <EOS>
